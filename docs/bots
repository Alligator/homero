Other bots we should "borrow" ideas from:

supybot http://supybot.com/
 - horribly bloated plugin structure, each plugin has its own directory and 4 files (unit testing for plugins what)

phenny http://inamidst.com/phenny/
 - inspiration for skybot, too much magic and not easy enough to change

pyfibot http://code.google.com/p/pyfibot/
 - interesting, but lots of magic

rbot http://linuxbrit.co.uk/rbot/
 - Ruby
 - lots of plugins

pyirc http://www.k-pdt.net/pyirc/
 - very simple, not multithreaded
 - poor use of regexes, skybot has much better parsing, but it implements many more irc control codes
 - can convert irc colors to vt100 escape codes -- should implement this
 - autoreconnect

pybot
 - can handle multiple servers, but not multithreaded
 - ugly modules
 - too many external dependencies
 - attempt at NLP
