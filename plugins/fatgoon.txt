Whenever I go to Wendy's with my family, we all dip our fries in the 
chocolate Frosties. All my friends thought I was crazy for that one until I 
convinced them to try it. Now they all do it too.
%
I love to mix Cherry Coke and chocolate milk, too. People freak out at that 
for some reason and I can't figure out why. It's like a sundae, but 
drinkable!  And I can't eat a turkey and cheese sandwich unless I put 
Flaming-Hot Cheetos on it.
%
I like to dip grilled cheese sandwiches into ramen. It softens the sandwich 
if it's a little crispy, and I don't a lot of broth with my ramen. Chicken is 
the best kind for doing this.
%
I like the occasional mayo sandwich. One slice of white bread with a huge 
smear of mayo, folded over. I'd probably enjoy the PB & mayo variety if I 
wasn't allergic to the PB.

I can't stand eating spaghetti if I don't have a few mayo sandwiches to go 
along with it.
%
Nacho dorritos with cottage cheese for a dip. My dad used to eat it when I 
was a kid, I have no idea why, and I picked it up from him. The concept makes 
my wife want to throw up but I think she just doesn't like cottage cheese.
%
first a bed of rice, then 2-5 slices of pan fried spam on top, followed by 
1-3 eggs cooked sunny side up (yolks HAVE to be runny!) on top of the spam. 
It seems like people think I'm a freak after I tell them spam, eggs, and rice 
is the best food ever... well everyone except most Filipinos.

oh, i also enjoy putting McD fries into my McD 99cent double cheeseburger, 
sometimes also with a few chicken nuggets. And of course there is always the 
obligatory wendy's fries dipped in chocolate frosty, but thats not gross, its 
delicious.
%
I like buy a can of nacho cheese and bean dip, lather it on a flour tortilla, 
roll it around a hot dog and microwave it. I can feel my arteries clog up as 
i take a bite. Also, peanut butter and pickle sandwich with toasted bread 
usually makes people freak out, though my whole family eats those.
%
I enjoy going to mcdonalds and getting a "mcchicken with every condiment 
known to mcdonalds" on it, and yes thats how i order them.
%
Orville Redenbacher Ultimate Butter microwave popcorn, just slightly burnt, 
with Kraft Ranch dressing mixed to where each kernel has a nice, light glaze. 
Serve with an ice-cold Coke. 


I just came a little.
%
Peanut Butter and Mayonnaise sandwich. My mom would make them all the time 
when I was a kid I just got used to it. When I tell people out it they look 
at my like I am eating children.
%
Peanutbutter and CheeseWhiz sandwiches....mmmmmmm

No one understands....
%
Okay, so I just got back from subway, and I ordered my normal sandwich 
(footlong BMT), and I got it with provolone and mustard and ranch sauce and 
olives and pickles and banana peppers and lettuce and onions and tomatoes and 
also bacon, and an extra large soft drink and 2 choco (thats what i call 
chocolate) chip cookies, and the cute latino girl behind the counter was 
trying to look away from my face and also holding back laughs.
%
You don't need a membership to eat at Costco's fantastically cheap food 
court. Basic lunch of a hot dog + soda for $1.50, or splurge on a chicken 
bake + smoothie for $5? yes please. just walk and enter through the exit, 
nobody has harassed me about it at all.
%
Country Crock Dogs.

As a young fella, I would get three or four hot dog buns, fill them each with 
enough Shedd's Spread Country Crock to choke a mule, run them in the 
microwave long enough for the Country Crock to partially melt and for the 
bread to get slightly warm, then wolf them down while watching TV.
%
Going to the NC State Fair every year and spending one whole day, from 
mid-morning until 9 at night, walking around gorging myself on roasted turkey 
legs, elephant ears, funnel cakes, and fried candy bars.
%
I always get the the Hamburgao Frango which has chicken, ham, tomatoes, 
lettuce, potato sticks, bacon, mayo, corn and egg(I think) on it. It's so 
good and so big. This one time I got that sandwich, some pizza pocket thing 
they had, and chicken on a stick with bacon wrapped around it.
%
Probably the time I craved Twinkies, so I went out and bought two boxes and 
ate them all.

I hate Twinkies now.

Unless they're deep-fried. Damn, those are good.
%
Five Wendy's jr. bacon cheeseburgers, a double cheeseburger, four plates of 
food at a buffet while at Cedar Point in Ohio...within an 8 hour period.

That's not including the amount of liquids during that time.

I ate about 40 wings today at hooters


and got 20 to go.

After I quit my crappy job at Wal-Mart, I ate a birthday cake by myself. I 
had just turned in my vest and as I was walking out of the store I passed by 
the bakery and wanted to celebrate. So I picked up one of the really nice 
cakes, like the ones with the jelly filling in the center, got back to my 
place, started playing 'Sid Meiers Pirates!' and ate cake and drank beer till 
the morning. Damn it was great.
%
When I was in high school, I drove after school to a Dunkin' Donuts and ate 
thirteen donuts, almost all of which were cream- or jelly-filled.

Two hours later, I went home and ate dinner: seven legs of fried chicken 
(that's the full leg, drumstick and thigh).
%
My whole life is a fat moment. I once killed a Boston Market family meal for 
3 by myself. Meatloaf (a whole one) with mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, 
and macaroni and cheese as the sides (all large). Oh and 3 pieces of 
cornbread.
%
Four double cheeseburgers from McDonalds, along with

20 piece McNugget
Super Sized Fry (damn you Morgan Spurlock!)
Super Sized Coke

or

a large pizza + 3/4's of another large pizza from Domino's, along with two 
boxes of those fucking amazing cheesy dot things they had for that one summer.

I am a fatty
%
I used to eat those gallon tubs of smarties ice cream. I added whipped cream, 
m & m's, and Nutella.

Looking back I now realize that I put Nutella in pretty much anything I eat.
I'm really fat.
%
I love KFC, it's going to kill me one one day. I can eat 4-5 snackers, a 
large mashed (yea, I use the kfc slang), and a cup of mountain dew in a 
sitting. It's gross, but fuck it, it's delicious.
%
I'm 6' tall and weigh over 500 pounds, though I'm not sure of the exact 
amount as the scale I have only goes up to 500. That said, I felt the need to 
post in this thread to say that the scales in most doctors' offices only go 
up to 350. I was asked to go to a butcher to be weighed by a doctor once, to 
which I said fuck you and found another doctor.
%
Warmer weather is coming and gone are the days I can hide underneath a 
sweater. I'm 6'0'' and 235 pounds, which is right at the boundary between 
overweight and obese...I wear XL shirts, but sometimes they seem too small on 
me, especially after washing them. The fat on my stomach, sides and chest 
show thru the shirt...However, most XXL shirts I seem to swim in. While it 
somewhat disguises my excess fat, the shoulders and necks are too big. Does 
anyone have any advice on how to look my best with a gut, other than the 
obvious "lose your gut"?
%
I have tried and failed before. I am huge I am 5'8 and close to 400lbs. I am 
not sure how I am still alive. Anyways my doctor has been no help(He just 
wants me on medications). I have decided to try again to take matters into my 
own hands and with the help of my mom whos a nurse I am getting my act 
togeather. I have seen a friend of mine who was similar to me lose 100lbs and 
its inspired me to do the same. 

Today is day 1 whats a reasonable goal for 2 months?
%
I honestely never even knew about gyncomastia until sometime around April or 
May of last year and I learned about it from SA. When I did a little research 
on it I immediately knew that I had it even before I went to a doctor, it was 
that obvious to me.
%
Is there any reason why some people have bigger man titties than others? I'm 
not thin, but I'm not obese, but my boobies are pretty impressive. (They seem 
to stick out more than my belly.) My brother who has a very similar build to 
me is fatter than me, but has less boobage going on.
%
I spend a fair amount of time sitting on my ass in front of my computer, and 
I've gotten alot of time between two chairs (one at my dorm, one at home). 
However, both now seems to have an odor to them. The upholstery...seems to 
have taken up the smell of years of sweat, flatulence and other stuff that 
seditard human generates over a period of a few years of use and it smells 
kinda rank when you first plop down.
%
I never ate crazy amounts of food, either - my weight is a combination of 
poor food choices and a highly sedentary lifestyle. When I started playing 
World of Warcraft, I saw how dangerous it could be, but didn't stop. When the 
South Park episode lampooning WoW came out, I threw my game in the trash and 
haven't looked back. Tangent over.
%
I'm only 5'6"... When I looked at the scale, my heart nearly exploded in my 
chest. I felt faint. I knew I had gained weight, and figured I was around 270 
or so - after all, at 190, I wore XL shirts (I'm short, but all torso, so I 
had to wear them for the length) and I'd only gone up to 2XL (and 3XL in 
button-up, but I pretended that was because I liked them loose-fitting. The 
scale showed the ugly truth.

I weigh 349. Three hundred and forty-nine pounds. 

I'm glad I bought the extra-strength scale.
%
Crushed up Doritos + Gummy Bears = Gummy Crunch. Fucking delicious. Had some 
about an hour ago, in fact.
%
I work in an office that likes to eat. There is always some kind of food in 
the kitchen, and my desk is literally across the hall from said feeding 
ground. Today there was a gigantic box of cookies (like, wholesale sized) and 
a huge bowl of candy. I was depressed over some money issues that I have no 
control over (I'm waiting to hear back on some scholarships/grants that will 
determine how the next 4 years of my life go, or don't go), and then before I 
knew it I'd eaten so much sugar my tongue hurt.
%
Sure, I can make low calorie muffins, and they're much better for me than 
their full fat equivalents, but if I come home depressed from work and eat 
eight of them, it kind of defeats the purpose...
%
I am an emotional eater, and I have a very unhealthy relationship with food. 
Everything is more or less fine, until I get upset or depressed, and then I 
just lose my freaking mind, not just about eating but about the way I *think* 
about eating. I can enjoy a delicious meal out, and then hear some upsetting 
news, and 5 minutes later be viciously beating myself up for having consumed 
something so high in calories/fat/whatever. The biggest problem though, is 
the binge eating. I get into this state of mind where I become an automaton, 
an eating *machine*. I know what I'm doing, I want to stop, but I stuff 
another cookie down my gaping maw anyway. It's like I'm watching a movie of 
myself -- I'm disconnected, I have no control. This always happens when I am 
depressed or upset, and as you can imagine, it becomes a vicious circle... I 
get depressed and eat, then get depressed about eating, hate myself, and eat 
some more.
%
Is there a specific exercise that helps get rid of bitch tits? I'm sure 
pretty much any exercise is going to help get rid of the rack I got growing 
from my chest but I was just curious if there is one exercise that really 
works that area of the body?
%
I can't stop snacking when I'm watching TV or on the computer. I've got an 
Ice cream cone in each hand as I read this thread (using my pinkies to 
scroll) and I just had a bowl of tostitos with salsa. The amount of food I 
eat with such consistency scares me sometimes. It's just something familiar I 
can't do without. I've challanged myself just to see how much I can eat at 
one time and I'm almost proud of it, though. I've scarfed down an entire 
jumbo pizza and entire cooked chicken (on seperate occassions) with no ill 
effects or need to vomit. I HAVE eaten enough to make myself vomit, 
unintentionally, simply because I was so bored.
%
I've noticed that my belly has started to grow bigger and bigger, and I tried 
to put a stop to it but I can't seem to do it. I've stopped drinking sodas 
and alcohol, and started cooking more frequently at home to eat healthier. 
The only thing I can't stay away from are pizzas, but I guess I can eat 1 or 
2 a week.
%
Anyone know what exercises or whatever I should do? I'm honestly getting fat 
within those areas. My belly is getting fat, my thighs are ridiculously large 
in proportion. I don't really eat a lot, but if I do I always eat salad on 
the side.
%
What really got to me was how depressed I was in my job, and I think it sort 
of extended to everything in my life. I didn't attribute it to my weight, but 
I think that my job situation just gave me an excuse to escape through 
unhealthy food, a ton of binge drinking, and a sedentary life. Last 
september, I left that job and started job searching, still depressed and 
still gaining weight. Last month, I tipped the scales at 320 pounds.

The World of Warcraft expansion comes out in a couple days and I have the 
entire week off from work. I want to grind as much as I can during that week. 
I'm planning on drinking a lot of caffeine, taking some of that "5 hour 
energy" stuff, and eating a bunch of cheap rear end frozen pizza. (The 6 for 
10 dollars variety). I'm pretty sure this diet is going to end in disaster. 
Can anyone recommend a diet that would keep me awake but not result in a 
"crash" a few hours later?
%
I do have one huge problem though. I like meat. I hate, with a passion, 
veggies. I've tried forcing myself to eat veggies, like broccoli, only to 
puke them up. The only veggies I enjoy are Corn, potatoes, fried okra, cooked 
carrots(with butter, or else I don't really like them), spinach cooked in a 
small amount of butter though I can only eat a small amount, and cucumber raw 
in small doses. I'm attempting to try and force my taste buds into liking 
green veggies again, but when I say I puke from it, I'm not kidding.
%
My diet used to be burgers, burgers, and cokes. I hate fries, so never had 
that problem, but I ate enough fast food burgers to match my own weight 
within a few months, most likely.

A big thing for me was learning the difference between "full" and 
"satisfied." I used to always eat until I was "full," but once I realized 
there's a difference between: 1) Eating enough to not be hungry anymore, and 
2) Eating so much that you can't comfortably eat anymore, the weight just 
melted off.
%
Get two digital scales and put a board across them. Make sure the board is on 
before you turn them on, so they are zeroed correctly. Now stand on the 
board. Add the weight shown on both scales and that's you're weight.

I'm talking fast food more than once a day. And sometimes two value meals 
instead of one.
%
I would get biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. Sometimes I would get a 
mcbreakfast. Sometimes I would get a mcbreakfast THEN get the biscuits and 
gravy. For lunch I would usually have something fried from the cafeteria, or 
a deli sub. Then for dinner whatever my mum made, usually pasta. Then 
probably at least one TV dinner before bed. Also, gallons of diet coke.

I'm a 23 year old paramedic, weighing in at 285 pounds and 6'1". I need to

I spent one year practically in the bed playing world of warcraft and eating

two slices of my friend's dad's pumpkin bread pie, ice cream, more cranberry

homemade salsa, and atleast a gallon of pepsi.

I had 3 plates: 1 for turkey, gravy and mashed potatoes, a second plate for

I have become addicted to eating. Whenever I am bored, or just have nothing

something like that. Also, the meals I make are FAR to big, portion wise.

burgers, battered fish. I know I am addicted, but I can't for the life of me 
stop. Anyone know any useful tips to help me stop it?

well past into 'obese' territory, even on my large-ish frame.

It isn't just that veggies taste bad its that they taste disgusting (to me)
