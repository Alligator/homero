VYeah, well, he said he wished he never had it.
p8
sg4
I10
sa(dp9

VI know. Can you believe that?
p10
sg4
I6
sa(dp11
g2
V(unamused) That's very funny.
p12
sg4
I4
sa(dp13
g2
VWhat am I supposed to do? He's afraid of the thing.
p14
sg4
I11
sa(dp15
g2
VIt's not more advanced. It is a random characteristic.
p16
sg4
I9
sa(dp17
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh, clearly, I am overcome with envy.
p18
sg4
I8
sa(dp19

VAtlantis.
p22

g2
VKeep moving.
p24
sg4
I2
sa(dp25
g2
VThere's nothing to be afraid of.
p26
sg4
I6
sa(dp27
g2
V(insistent) This device has survived for millions of years intact. It will survive you. Now, sit down, close your eyes, and concentrate.
p28
sg4
I22
sa(dp29
g2
VOkay, this time just try to imagine an image of where we are in the solar system.
p30
sg4
I17
sa(dp31
g2
V(annoyed) Shut up. And concentrate.
p32
sg4
I5
sa(dp33
g2
VIt doesn't matter now. Just do something!
p34
sg4
I7
sa(dp35
g2
VAfter all that time, is there any hope of actually meeting them?
p36
sg4
I12
sa(dp37
g2
VWe need the "Zed-PM" to power the gate.
p38
sg4
I8
sa(dp39
g2
VOh, "Zero-Point Module," General. The Ancient power source you recovered from Praclarush Taonas and that's now powering the outpost's defenses. I've since determined that it generates its enormous power from vacuum energy derived from a self-contained region of subspace time.
p40
sg4
I40
sa(dp41
g2
VMajor, think about where we are in the solar system.
p42
sg4
I10
sa(dp43
g2
VOkay, Sergeant, give it a try. The ZPM should light up when it senses a conductive connection to the gate.
p44
sg4
I20
sa(dp45
g2
V(pleased) Oh, yeah.
p46
sg4
I3
sa(dp47
g2
V(quietly) Yeah.
p48
sg4
I2
sa(dp49
g2
V(drily) I've never been so excited in my entire life.
p50
sg4
I10
sa(dp51
g2
VThe radar indicates\u2026a large room?
p52
sg4
I5
sa(dp53
g2
VEnvironmental sensors say there's oxygen, no measurable toxins. We have viable life support. It looks like we're not getting out of this.
p54
sg4
I22
sa(dp55
g2
VThis has got to be the control room. This is obviously their version of a DHD.
p56
sg4
I16
sa(dp57
g2
V(moving to another console) This area could be power control systems, possibly a computer interface\u2014
p58
sg4
I15
sa(dp59
g2
VRight.
p60
sg4
I1
sa(dp61
g2
VColonel, Dr. Weir\u2014
p62
sg4
I3
sa(dp63
g2
VYes, I was just coming to tell you. Fortunately, there's some sort of a force field holding back the wa&emdash;(he slows, looking at the scene) \u2026water. Oh, that is impressive, isn't it? Uh, Dr. Beckett has found something you should, uh, see.
p64
sg4
I42
sa(dp65
g2
VHuh. So the story of Atlantis is true. A great city that sank in the ocean.
p66
sg4
I16
sa(dp67
g2
VWell, the Ancient Greeks must have heard it from one of the surviving Ancients.
p68
sg4
I14
sa(dp69
g2
V(nervously) Stop. Turn it off.
p70
sg4
I5
sa(dp71
g2
VPower levels throughout the city are dropping like a stone.
p72
sg4
I10
sa(dp73
g2
VThat if we don't stop everything we're doing right now, we are dead.
p74
sg4
I13
sa(dp75
g2
V(rolling his eyes) No.
p76
sg4
I4
sa(dp77
g2
VFrom what we've been able to ascertain, the city is powered by three Zero-Point Modules. Two are entirely depleted, and the third is reaching maximum entropy. When it does, it will die too, and nothing can reverse that.
p78
sg4
I38
sa(dp79
g2
VThe force field holding back the ocean has collapsed to its minimum sustainable levels. Look, you can see here and here where the shield's already failed and the city's flooded. It could've happened years ago. but\u2026 This section is likely more protected because of the Stargate.
p80
sg4
I46
sa(dp81
g2
VIt's a matter of "when," not "if."
p82
sg4
I7
sa(dp83
g2
VThat's not going to be good enough.
p84
sg4
I7
sa(dp85
g2
VIt's hard to say. Hours, maybe days, if we minimize power expenditure.
p86
sg4
I12
sa(dp87
g2
VWe're working on that, but even with our most advanced, naquadah-powered generators, the equations are coming up far short.
p88
sg4
I19
sa(dp89
g2
VIf there were more here, we'd be able to detect them.
p90
sg4
I11
sa(dp91
g2
VThere's nowhere near enough power to open a wormhole back to Earth.
p92
sg4
I12
sa(dp93
g2
V(considering) Well, that's relatively easy. Fortunately, some Ancient technology still uses good, old-fashioned push buttons, so we've been able to access the Stargate control system and a library of known gate addresses in the database.
p94
sg4
I35
sa(dp95
g2
V(nervously) Using power, using power, using power\u2026
p96
sg4
I7
sa(dp97
g2
V(with pomp) Chevron one encoded.
p98
sg4
I5
sa(dp99
g2
VFine.
p100
sg4
I1
sa(dp101
g2
VI can't do that.
p102
sg4
I4
sa(dp103
g2
VAnd probably would've kept going for years more, but our arrival changed that. Now it's nothing more than a thin shell between the buildings and the water.
p104
sg4
I27
sa(dp105
g2
VThe damage was already done. Another section of the city, on the far side, was flooded an hour or so ago.
p106
sg4
I21
sa(dp107
g2
VThe sooner we leave, the longer that shield holds.
p108
sg4
I9
sa(dp109
g2
V(interrupting) The city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
p110
sg4
I20
sa(dp111
g2
VIn order to save it.
p112
sg4
I5
sa(dp113
g2
VWe'll be back. We'll find a power source somewhere in Pegasus.
p114
sg4
I11
sa(dp115
g2
VWe can't wait. It is time to go, now.
p116
sg4
I9
sa(dp117
g2
VThe shield is collapsing!
p118
sg4
I4
sa(dp119
g2
VShe's right.
p120
sg4
I2
sa(dp121
g2
VThe last Zero-Point Module is depleted, but limited power has returned now that our own generators aren't going to hold back an ocean. Life support systems are working, but the planet's atmosphere is breathable, well, notwithstanding the inevitable allergens.
p122
sg4
I39
sa(dp123
g2
VNot even close.
p124
sg4
I3
sa(dp125
g2
V(sarcastic) I'm acutely aware of that, Major, but thank you for reinforcing it.
p126
sg4
I13
sa(dp127
g2
VEven with the six symbols Lieutenant Ford provided there are still hundreds of permutations\u2014
p128
sg4
I14
sa(dp129
g2
V(nonplussed) Yes. I knew that, of course. I'm just surprised you did.
p130
sg4
I12
sa(dp131
g2
VNo atmospheric readings at all.
p132
sg4
I5
sa(dp133
g2
VRotate the camera.
p134
sg4
I3
sa(dp135
g2
V(scoffing) Well, there goes that MALP.
p136
sg4
I6
sa(dp137
g2
VIt's in high orbit around a planet on the far side of the galaxy.
p138
sg4
I14
sa(dp139
g2
VIt's the only one we could get a lock on.
p140
sg4
I10
sa(dp141
g2
VCome with me, Major.
p142
sg4
I4
sa(dp143
g2
VYou think you can fly it?
p144
sg4
I6
sa(dp145
g2
V(exasperated) I\u2026I don't\u2026 He was right here. Major!
p146
sg4
I8
sa(dp147
g2
V(speaking rapidly) I have no idea. This technology is so far beyond us, I mean, we haven't a clue what we're dealing with. I mean, for all I know, we could\u2026
p148
sg4
I31
sa(dp149
g2
VYeah. Ready.
p150
sg4
I2
sa(dp151
g2
V(miffed) This is Flight. I thought we were going with Gateship.
p152
sg4
I11
sa(dp153
g2
VStand by. It's a ship that goes through the gate.
p154
sg4
I10
sa(dp155
g2
VUh\u2026fine. (into radio) Puddle Jumper, you are clear for launch.
p156
sg4
I10
sa(dp157
g2
V(excitedly) Dr. Weir. We're getting reports in from all over the city. There's some pretty interesting stuff. We've only been able to provide power to certain sections, but even then, the things that are coming up are just\u2026
p158
sg4
I38
sa(dp159
g2
VFor what it's worth, you made the right decision. Give them time.
p160
sg4
I12
sa(dp161
g2
VNothing yet.
p162
sg4
I2
sa(dp163
g2
VI'm reading Lieutenant Ford's IDC.
p164
sg4
I5
sa(dp165
g2
VYou need to get out more.
p166
sg4
I6
sa(dp167
g2
V(distracted by his chicken) Is there lemon in this?
p168
sg4
I9
sa(dp169
g2
VThis planet is basically the same size as Earth. Now, hurricanes on Earth never get as big as this bad boy because once they hit the shore, the brakes get put on. But without as much land mass to slow it down here, it's just gaining momentum.
p170
sg4
I47
sa(dp171
g2
VYes.
p172
sg4
I1
sa(dp173
g2
VIt only looked like one. Now, according to the ancient database, every twenty or thirty years, the sea gets unseasonably warm. Now, that, for reasons too boring to get into, means that hurricanes are much more likely to occur.
p174
sg4
I39
sa(dp175
g2
V(dismissively) Like I said, too boring to go into.
p176
sg4
I9
sa(dp177
g2
VLook, basically, if you have a situation where there are a bunch of hurricanes out there, the likelihood of two colliding is greatly increased. That's what's happening.
p178
sg4
I27
sa(dp179
g2
VAnd? It's headed right towards us.
p180
sg4
I6
sa(dp181
g2
VIn the past, the Ancients have been protected by the shield, or submerged deep enough in the water not be affected.
p182
sg4
I21
sa(dp183
g2
VNot to mention the fact that by moving over a land mass just before hitting us, the likelihood of tornadoes and electrical activity is greatly increased.
p184
sg4
I26
sa(dp185
g2
VNo.
p186
sg4
I1
sa(dp187
g2
VThe people who built this city knew they had a force field capable of holding back anything mother nature, or, for that matter, the Wraith could throw at them. Without that protection, Atlantis is remarkably fragile.
p188
sg4
I36
sa(dp189
g2
VFlooding could sink the city entirely.
p190
sg4
I6
sa(dp191
g2
VYes, well, let's not.
p192
sg4
I4
sa(dp193
g2
VBy my calculations, we have just under twelve hours until the storm hits, so, uh\u2026 We plan to have a plan\u2026
p194
sg4
I21
sa(dp195
g2
VBy then.
p196
sg4
I2
sa(dp197
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no, I've already thought of that.
p198
sg4
I10
sa(dp199
g2
VI've already thought of it! It doesn't\u2014 Yes, the naquadah generators could be used to power select sections of the city, but when you subtract the areas that need to be secured just to protect themselves, it doesn't leave much power to shield anything else, and the city breaks apart because of the tidal stresses.
p200
sg4
I55
sa(dp201
g2
V(loudly sarcastic) You're right. If only we had a magical tool that could slow down time. I foolishly left mine on Earth. Did you bring yours?
p202
sg4
I26
sa(dp203
g2
VI'm always like this.
p204
sg4
I4
sa(dp205
g2
VOf course it's not. We can always gate off to another planet.
p206
sg4
I12
sa(dp207
g2
VI will try, but despite what you all may think, I am not Superman.
p208
sg4
I14
sa(dp209
g2
VFine. My point is the storm will affect over seventy percent of the mainland and Atlantis isn't safe either. If you want everyone to live, you gate them off-world.
p210
sg4
I29
sa(dp211
g2
VWe don't get that many in Canada either. Once something called "Hazel."
p212
sg4
I12
sa(dp213
g2
VForty years ago.
p214
sg4
I3
sa(dp215
g2
VNot really.
p216
sg4
I2
sa(dp217
g2
VI was once almost struck by lightning.
p218
sg4
I7
sa(dp219
g2
VWhat is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?
p220
sg4
I11
sa(dp221
g2
VPower. And what does a mega-storm from hell have lots of?
p222
sg4
I11
sa(dp223
g2
VIn the form of?
p224
sg4
I4
sa(dp225
g2
VElectricity!
p226
sg4
I1
sa(dp227
g2
VAll those rods are channeled into four main grounding stations.
p228
sg4
I10
sa(dp229
g2
VNow, many of the hallways are lined with a superconductive material that allows a safe, low-voltage transfer of power throughout the city.
p230
sg4
I22
sa(dp231
g2
VI'm getting there, I'm getting there. Let's say the grounding stations weren't around. Every time lightning struck the city, those halls would become supercharged.
p232
sg4
I24
sa(dp233
g2
VIf we were able to disable the grounding stations\u2026
p234
sg4
I9
sa(dp235
g2
VEvery time lightning struck the city, Atlantis would experience a momentary massive power surge. Now, that energy\u2014
p236
sg4
I17
sa(dp237
g2
VYes, of course if channeled correctly\u2014 could conceivably be used to charge up the shield generator. Now, the more severe the storm, the more energy is produced and the longer we can keep the shield running.
p238
sg4
I36
sa(dp239
g2
VI'm compelled to agree.
p240
sg4
I4
sa(dp241
g2
VAh, once the storm stops and the lightning stops striking\u2026
p242
sg4
I10
sa(dp243
g2
VThen we're back to square one.
p244
sg4
I6
sa(dp245
g2
VI'd give us better than ninety percent\u2014
p246
sg4
I7
sa(dp247
g2
VEighty percent chance.
p248
sg4
I3
sa(dp249
g2
VYes, but not just because of Zelemka's pessimism.
p250
sg4
I8
sa(dp251
g2
VMm. We need to evacuate everyone off-world until the storm passes and execute the plan with the smallest team possible.
p252
sg4
I20
sa(dp253
g2
VRight. To the grounding stations.
p254
sg4
I5
sa(dp255
g2
VAh, good point, good call. Okay. I tend to get ahead of myself.
p256
sg4
I13
sa(dp257
g2
VThat's everybody. We've got just over four and a half hours until the storm hits. Let's get down to the labs.
p258
sg4
I21
sa(dp259
g2
VThere are dozens, possibly hundreds of lightning rods placed strategically around the city.
p260
sg4
I13
sa(dp261
g2
VWhat?
p262
sg4
I1
sa(dp263
g2
VWhy what?
p264
sg4
I2
sa(dp265
g2
VYes, yes, it would but running the shield all the time is only good for one thing\u2026draining power.
p266
sg4
I18
sa(dp267
g2
VYou're aware that there is a time element to what we're doing here, right?
p268
sg4
I14
sa(dp269
g2
VLike I was saying, there are lightning rods, a lot of them, placed all over the city. Now, as it stands right now, all the energy they capture is routed into four main grounding stations. In turn, these stations ground all that energy into the ocean below us.
p270
sg4
I48
sa(dp271
g2
VWe use it to power the shield.
p272
sg4
I7
sa(dp273
g2
VBy directing it right down the corridors of Atlantis and into the shield generators.
p274
sg4
I14
sa(dp275
g2
VYes\u2026theoretically.
p276
sg4
I1
sa(dp277
g2
VWhat? Uh\u2026somewhere between. Elizabeth\u2026you take grounding station two; I'll take grounding station one. Major, you take stations three and four.

sa(dp279
g2
V(indicating on a map) Here and here.
p280
sg4
I7
sa(dp281

VHere, yes. I need to get done quickly so I can start working on the sub-routines, and Elizabeth was complaining about her knee the other day, so\u2014
p282
sg4
I27
sa(dp283
g2
VUh, yes, Elizabeth's is.
p284
sg4
I4
sa(dp285
g2
V(cagily) It's a brisk walk away.
p286
sg4
I6
sa(dp287
g2
VBy walk I mean run.
p288
sg4
I5
sa(dp289
g2
VYou'll need to radio in once you've gotten to your first station.
p290
sg4
I12
sa(dp291
g2
V(over radio) I told you to contact me when you got to the first one, Major.
p292

p306
sg4

VElizabeth, just give him what he needs.
p314
sg4
I7
sa(dp315

VI was leaning! I was just leaning!
p318

V(chucking nervously) You'd think so, wouldn't you?
p326
sg4
I7
sa(dp327
g2
VI've got lots of plans about lots of things.
p328
sg4
I9
sa(dp329
g2
VI never said anything about saving anything.
p330
sg4

sa(dp331
g2
VI tried to keep my mouth shut. I tried, I just, I couldn't\u2026
p332

VOh!
p338

I24
sa(dp341
g2
VGet off me!
p342
sg4
I3
sa(dp343
g2
V(pleading) You can't do this. This is crazy. You need her.
p344
sg4
I11
sa(dp345
g2
VI\u2019m not kidding. There are codes required to activate the shield, codes that only she knows. You can't do it without her. (realizing Kolya might kill him instead) Well, you can't do this without me either. I mean, we're a package deal. I mean, you take us out of the equation, and you don't have an end game. Granted, that's a chess term. My point is, we're the only ones who can fix the grounding station. (voice increasing until he's shouting) We're the only ones who can activate the shield. We're the only ones that can solve problems I can\u2019t even think of yet. You kill either one of us, and you don't get what you want! That's how important we are. It's impor\u2014

VDon't thank me just yet. We've got two and a half hours till the storm hits, and unless our luck changes drastically, this city is going to be obliterated.
p348
sg4
I29
sa(dp349
g2
VOh, will you look at this? Now, that is just\u2026 That is just never going to be useful again.
p350
sg4
I19
sa(dp351
g2
VI should be able to bypass this switching station entirely.
p352
sg4
I10
sa(dp353
g2
VIt's not half as bad as it looks. I'd say fifteen, twenty minutes tops.
p354
sg4
I14
sa(dp355
g2
VDr. Weir, I need you to\u2014
p356
sg4
I6
sa(dp357
g2
VKeep that there.
p358
sg4
I3
sa(dp359
g2
VOh, I don't know. Maybe so he wouldn't kill us.
p360
sg4
I10
sa(dp361
g2
VWhy did you let me tell him I could fix it in fifteen or twenty?
p362
sg4
I15
sa(dp363
g2
VWell, I just told him how long it'll take.
p364
sg4
I9
sa(dp365
g2
V"Isn't jiving"?
p366
sg4
I2
sa(dp367
g2
V(to Weir) If he asks what's taking so long, you have to do all the talking, okay?
p368
sg4
I17
sa(dp369
g2
VNo, no, I won't. I'm a terrible bluffer. I've lost small fortunes at poker. My eye twitches. I laugh inappropriately. It's not pretty.
p370
sg4
I23
sa(dp371
g2
VIt's a small snag, small snag. It's, like, half an hour at the most.
p372
sg4
I14
sa(dp373
g2
V(looking at dead connectors) Without power? No.
p374
sg4
I7
sa(dp375
g2
VNo. No, it's just not good enough. Look, by uncoupling the grounding stations, it means that when lightning strikes the city, the electricity will have nowhere to go. Now, if we can channel the electricity properly through the conduits that line the city corridors, we should be able to power the shield\u2026temporarily. If any of these grounding stations are left active, a sizable amount of electricity will find its way to ground and no shield.
p376
sg4
I75
sa(dp377
g2
VPerhaps we can be under shelter while we wait. I'm liable to catch a cold like that\u2026
p378
sg4
I17
sa(dp379
g2
VI take it that's a "no"?
p380
sg4
I6
sa(dp381
g2
VI can't. I don't know what he's done!
p382
sg4
I8
sa(dp383
g2
VWell, he must have entered his own personal command code.
p384
sg4
I10
sa(dp385
g2
VI don't know!
p386
sg4
I3
sa(dp387
g2
VTrust me, I'm not that brave. I would help you if I could.
p388
sg4
I13
sa(dp389
g2
V(shouting) You still need me if you want this city! You still need both of us!
p390
sg4
I16
sa(dp391
g2
VProbably sooner.
p392
sg4
I2
sa(dp393
g2
VIf this doesn't work\u2026
p394
sg4
I4
sa(dp395
g2
VI'm just saying, if it doesn't work\u2026
p396
sg4
I7
sa(dp397
g2
VI'm sure it will, but in the unlikely event that it doesn't\u2014
p398
sg4
I12
sa(dp399
g2
VOh, thank God.
p400
sg4
I3
sa(dp401
g2
VNow\u2026I need to run the subroutine that will convince the input buffers in the shield generator to attenuate the raw electricity into usable power. I can only do that from the control room. That's where Dr. Weir's codes come in.
p402
sg4
I40
sa(dp403
g2
VThe shield's considered a primary system. We're good to go, but we have to go now. I mean now. I mean everybody, all your men.
p404
sg4
I25
sa(dp405
g2
VNow that the grounding station's been deactivated electricity will be free to flow through the conduits that line every corridor in the city.
p406
sg4
I23
sa(dp407
g2
VNow, the control room and Stargate operations are shielded, but the rest of the city\u2026(he shakes his head) Once the lightning starts to hit\u2026
p408
sg4
I24
sa(dp409
g2
VWhat for?
p410
sg4
I2
sa(dp411
g2
VIt's done. Dr. Weir, I need you to enter your codes now.
p412
sg4
I12
sa(dp413
g2
VYes?
p414
sg4
I1
sa(dp415
g2
VAnd the second sequence?
p416
sg4
I4
sa(dp417
g2
VI'm almost finished.
p418
sg4
I3
sa(dp419
g2
VWe're starting to get hits on the Northern Pier. Routing power to the corridor\u2026now. Now\u2026 Now.
p420
sg4
I16
sa(dp421
g2
VOkay, this is a problem.
p422
sg4
I5
sa(dp423
g2
VLook, I told you this was a long shot from the beginning.
p424
sg4
I12
sa(dp425
g2
VIt's no use. The city conduits just can't handle this kind of raw power.
p426
sg4
I14
sa(dp427
g2
VNominal amounts. Nowhere near enough.
p428
sg4
I5
sa(dp429
g2
VI don't know if you noticed or not, but I am an extremely arrogant man who tends to think all of his plans will work!
p430
sg4
I25
sa(dp431
g2
VWe're just not getting enough power to the shield generators.
p432
sg4
I10
sa(dp433
g2
VOh, for what we've done?
p434
sg4
I5
sa(dp435
g2
VSeriously, this is a bad idea. You saw what happened to my last plan. This is not what\u2014
p436
sg4
I18
sa(dp437
g2
VI thought I'd activate the shield and save the day. You got something else in mind?
p438
sg4
I16
sa(dp439
g2
VTracking system's down. There's a tsunami headed towards the city, Lieutenant. In two and a half minutes, they're dead.
p440
sg4
I19
sa(dp441
g2
VThere's no more time. We either lose them, or we lose the city.
p442
sg4
I13
sa(dp443
g2
VGoing!
p444
sg4
I1
sa(dp445
g2
V(in greeting) Carson.
p446
sg4
I3
sa(dp447
g2
VJust in time to see how this ends, huh?
p448
sg4
I9
sa(dp449
g2
V(pushing a button) Now.
p450
sg4
I4
sa(dp451
g2
VDid you ever doubt me?
p452
sg4
I5
sa(dp453
g2
VOh.
p454
sg4
I1
sa(dp455
g2
VEveryone getting back okay?
p456
sg4
I4
sa(dp457
g2
VWell, we've begun pumping out the lower levels of the East Pier, which was flooded. There is structural damage, nothing too serious. Beckett's suffered from a minor concussion. Hasn't been able to look at this. I had to do this myself.
p458
sg4
I41
sa(dp459
g2
VStill, on the bright side I've had my first decent meal in twenty-four hours, so all things considered, I would say we are just fine.
p460
sg4
I25
sa(dp461
g2
VI'm fine.
p462
sg4
I2
sa(dp463
g2
VI'm just seeing what this baby can do.
p464
sg4
I8
sa(dp465
g2
VIt's perfectly appropriate space pilot parlance.
p466
sg4
I6
sa(dp467
g2
VI'm flying in a straight line.
p468
sg4
I6
sa(dp469
g2
V(defensively, chastened) Well, in space, all motion is relative.
p470
sg4
I9
sa(dp471
g2
V(leaning over as well) Brendan's the one who discovered the Lagrangian Point satellite was out here. Elizabeth felt he should see it for himself.
p472
sg4
I24
sa(dp473
g2
V(taking them back) Snapping doesn't help!
p474
sg4
I6
sa(dp475
g2
VI am both insulted and touched by that.
p476
sg4
I8
sa(dp477
g2
VYes, yes, of course, please.
p478
sg4
I5
sa(dp479
g2
VWe're almost a half a mile away and it's filling the windshield. This thing is enormous.
p480
sg4
I16
sa(dp481
g2
VIt's probably the Ancients' last line of defense before Atlantis.
p482
sg4
I10
sa(dp483
g2
VOr its power source is depleted. Ten thousand years is a long time. We should still take a closer look\u2014
p484
sg4
I20
sa(dp485
g2
VIt's a distress call\u2026a Wraith distress call.
p486
sg4
I7
sa(dp487
g2
VI know. Celestially speaking, it's right in our backyard.
p488
sg4
I9
sa(dp489
g2
VIt's a very weak signal. Look, if any part of that ship is intact, the wealth of scientific and military knowledge we could acquire is invaluable.
p490
sg4
I26
sa(dp491
g2
VWe'll be fine.
p492
sg4
I3
sa(dp493
g2
VI assure you, our interest is purely professional, Elizabeth.
p494
sg4
I9
sa(dp495
g2
VWell, three hours? That's hardly enough time\u2014
p496
sg4
I7
sa(dp497
g2
V(mocking) "Radio communication could be difficult."
p498
sg4
I6
sa(dp499
g2
VAnd no thanks to you.
p500
sg4
I5
sa(dp501
g2
VDon't worry, Brendan. We weren't all built for fieldwork. (to Sheppard) Seriously, we're almost there, right?
p502
sg4
I16
sa(dp503
g2
VUh, okay, did I mention how allergic I was to bee stings?
p504
sg4
I12
sa(dp505
g2
V(fearful) Guys\u2026
p506
sg4
I2
sa(dp507
g2
VWell, it's been here for a very long time. Maybe they've discontinued that model.
p508
sg4
I14
sa(dp509
g2
VI think we can rule that out.
p510
sg4
I7
sa(dp511
g2
VFine.
p512
sg4
I1
sa(dp513
g2
VNo, it's just us and the glowy bugs. Nothing coming from the ship.
p514
sg4
I13
sa(dp515
g2
VI'm picking up faint power readings.
p516
sg4
I6
sa(dp517
g2
VIt's remarkably preserved.
p518
sg4
I3
sa(dp519
g2
VIt is\u2026 Yeah. Okay\u2026
p520
sg4
I4
sa(dp521
g2
VWhat the\u2014?
p522
sg4
I2
sa(dp523
g2
VWraith cannibalism?
p524
sg4
I2
sa(dp525
g2
VThey feed off each other?
p526
sg4
I5
sa(dp527
g2
VOkay, that is incredibly disturbing.
p528
sg4
I5
sa(dp529
g2
VThe Wraith cocoon humans. They keep their bodies in suspended animation, so later they can\u2026 Yeah.
p530
sg4
I16
sa(dp531
g2
VIt's a supply ship, on its way to feed the Wraith who were laying siege to Atlantis.
p532
sg4
I17
sa(dp533
g2
VWhat's the problem? They're all dead.
p534
sg4
I6
sa(dp535
g2
V(smiling) You wanted fieldwork. This\u2026is fieldwork.
p536
sg4
I6
sa(dp537
g2
VI'm not picking up anything in the E.M. spectrum. I may need to rig up a secondary power source so we can interface with their computer systems.
p538
sg4
I27
sa(dp539
g2
VWhat?
p540
sg4
I1
sa(dp541
g2
VWell, they're capable of hibernating for hundreds of years at a time, but, I mean, think about it. Ten thousand years ago was roughly the dawn of human civilization.
p542
sg4
I29
sa(dp543
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no. Are you kidding? Well\u2026maybe.
p544
sg4
I9
sa(dp545
g2
VNo. No. No living thing could survive that long under those conditions. It's ridiculous.
p546
sg4
I14
sa(dp547
g2
VThat would require an incredible power source capable of sustaining the stored humans in suspended animation almost the entire time.
p548
sg4
I20
sa(dp549
g2
VOh, my God. It is possible. We've got to get out of here.
p550
sg4
I13
sa(dp551
g2
VHe is dead.
p552
sg4
I3
sa(dp553
g2
VI don't know.
p554
sg4
I3
sa(dp555
g2
VIt must have taken him.
p556
sg4
I5
sa(dp557
g2
VWhat're you doing?
p558
sg4
I3
sa(dp559
g2
VI already have a gun.
p560
sg4
I5
sa(dp561
g2
VYou're not planning on going after the Wraith?
p562
sg4
I8
sa(dp563
g2
VI swear there was nothing alive when I scanned for life signs.
p564
sg4
I12
sa(dp565
g2
VWhat's that?
p566
sg4
I2
sa(dp567
g2
VYou're going to be all right.
p568
sg4
I6
sa(dp569
g2
VI'm sure the paralysis is just temporary. You'll be all right in a few hours.
p570
sg4
I15
sa(dp571
g2
VHe won't be able to fly it.
p572
sg4
I7
sa(dp573
g2
VI'm sure the Wraith were the main reason the Ancient technology only works if the operator has a specific gene.
p574
sg4
I20
sa(dp575
g2
VWho cares?
p576
sg4
I2
sa(dp577
g2
VHe might be able to do that.
p578
sg4
I7
sa(dp579
g2
VHe's got a head start.
p580
sg4
I5
sa(dp581
g2
VElizabeth will send another jumper. We just need to wait\u2014
p582
sg4
I10
sa(dp583
g2
VHe's right. We should stick together.
p584
sg4
I6
sa(dp585
g2
V(agitated) And I'm as sorry about that as you are, but just because we both made an error in judgment\u2014
p586
sg4
I20
sa(dp587
g2
V(yelling) Major. Major! (quietly, to Gall) It's fine, just\u2026 Okay.
p588
sg4
I10
sa(dp589
g2
VNo. Hopefully there's just the one.
p590
sg4
I6
sa(dp591
g2
VNo, don't be ridiculous.
p592
sg4
I4
sa(dp593
g2
VAnd why would they do that?
p594
sg4
I6
sa(dp595
g2
VYou look fine.
p596
sg4
I3
sa(dp597
g2
VYou look older, yes.
p598
sg4
I4
sa(dp599
g2
VThere's no point in doing this. You just\u2014
p600
sg4
I8
sa(dp601
g2
VI don't know how it works, Brendan. I don't think anybody does. Maybe you haven't really aged. Maybe it doesn't work that way. Look, it's possible that, in time you could get better. The important thing is that you're still alive\u2026 Can you move yet?
p602
sg4
I45
sa(dp603
g2
VWell, there's something. What? I'm just trying to help here. Look, you're the one who had to find the stupid satellite.
p604
sg4
I21
sa(dp605
g2
VYeah. You shouldn't laugh. It's\u2026it's not so good.
p606
sg4
I8
sa(dp607
g2
V(into radio) We're still here.
p608
sg4
I5
sa(dp609
g2
VThen you should get back here.
p610
sg4
I6
sa(dp611
g2
VThere's no point in you being out there\u2014
p612
sg4
I8
sa(dp613
g2
VWhat are you, Captain Kirk? What good's it going to do him?
p614
sg4
I12
sa(dp615
g2
VNo. Why?
p616
sg4
I2
sa(dp617
g2
VWe're six hours overdue. Assuming they waited an hour before sending a rescue mission\u2014
p618
sg4
I14
sa(dp619
g2
VMajor, anyone or anything capable of surviving that long is going to be a serious adversary.
p620
sg4
I16
sa(dp621
g2
VAnd if all doesn't go well?
p622
sg4
I6
sa(dp623
g2
VThings haven't gone all that well thus far.
p624
sg4
I8
sa(dp625
g2
VWell, eventually, yes, but\u2014

sg4
I4
sa(dp627

VHis can move his toes.
p628
sg4
I5
sa(dp629
g2
VThere. What'd I tell you, huh?
p630
sg4
I6
sa(dp631
g2
VWater. I'll lend you some water.
p632
sg4
I6
sa(dp633
g2
V(into radio) Major, what's happening?
p634
sg4
I5
sa(dp635
g2
VI don't like the sound of that.
p636
sg4
I7
sa(dp637
g2
VAre you injured?
p638
sg4
I3
sa(dp639
g2
VWell, the Wraith will heal itself.
p640
sg4
I6
sa(dp641
g2
VDr. Beckett has theorized that a Wraith's ability to heal itself is directly proportional to how recently the Wraith has fed, and he's\u2026fed pretty recently.
p642
sg4
I25
sa(dp643
g2
VBarely.
p644
sg4
I1
sa(dp645
g2
VMajor?
p646

sa(dp647
g2
VThat's comforting, huh? All right. Water.
p648
sg4
I6
sa(dp649
g2
V(into radio) Major, what the hell was that?
p650
sg4
I8
sa(dp651
g2
V(into radio) What?
p652
sg4
I3
sa(dp653
g2
V(to Gall) Right. He's busy.
p654
sg4
I5
sa(dp655
g2
VWhat? Me go up against a Wraith? Are you kidding?
p656
sg4
I10
sa(dp657
g2
VShut up.
p658
sg4
I2
sa(dp659
g2
V(serious) You heard the man. We're staying right here\u2026 All right. Take this, but don't shoot at anything until I tell you to, okay?
p660
sg4
I24
sa(dp661
g2
VYou're right. I should go out there.
p662
sg4
I7
sa(dp663
g2
VBecause I should.
p664
sg4
I3
sa(dp665
g2
VI can't leave you here.
p666
sg4
I5
sa(dp667
g2
VStop being so dramatic. You're getting stronger by the minute.
p668
sg4
I10
sa(dp669
g2
VThen stop talking.
p670
sg4
I3
sa(dp671
g2
V(angry) Stop it!
p672
sg4
I3
sa(dp673
g2
VListen to me. All you need is a good meal, a pot of tea, and to stop talking, and\u2014
p674
sg4
I19
sa(dp675
g2
VBrendan! I'm sorry.
p676
sg4
I3
sa(dp677
g2
VI'm sorry, I thought you'd\u2026 Apologies. As you were.
p678
sg4
I9
sa(dp679
g2
VYou hear that?
p680
sg4
I3
sa(dp681
g2
VI thought I heard something. Maybe there's another one hibernating.
p682
sg4
I10
sa(dp683
g2
VIt's been too long. I think the Major could be in trouble, and if he's in trouble, we're in trouble.
p684
sg4
I20
sa(dp685
g2
VDo you think you could move?
p686
sg4
I6
sa(dp687
g2
VOkay. That's okay.
p688
sg4
I3
sa(dp689
g2
VWhat I really want to do is call him on the radio, but I'm afraid if he's hiding from the Wraith, I might inadvertently give away his position, and let's face it, what chance would we have against the Wraith if Sheppard can't take him out? I was hoping you'd be strong enough, then I\u2014

VOh, come on. That's an easy one. Are you hearing this, Hays?

I12
sa(dp719

VWe've already been through this section of Atlantis, Dr. Killjoy. It's structurally sound.
p720

I13
sa(dp721
g2
V(into radio) Essentially, with the exception of the upper-level storage room, which the lovely and talented Dumais informs me is in no immediate danger, this pier is in relatively good shape.
p722
sg4
I31
sa(dp723
g2
V(into radio) Well, it's dark, it's damp, and it smells terrible, but from an engineering standpoint, we're good.
p724

I18
sa(dp725
g2
V(into radio) Heading back. (speaking up to assembled scientists) All right, you clowns, listen up. I don't often get a chance to say this, so savor it: Good work, boys and girls. Let's go home.

I35
sa(dp727

V(into radio) Wagner, Johnson, what's your position?
p728
sg4
I7
sa(dp729
g2
VWhat?
p730

I1
sa(dp731
g2
V(into radio) We're on our way!

VJohnson. Johnson, are you okay?
p734
sg4
I5
sa(dp735

VJohnson, what happened here?
p736
sg4
I4
sa(dp737
g2
VWho got him?
p738
sg4
I3
sa(dp739
g2
VCalm down. There's nothing here.
p740
sg4
I5
sa(dp741
g2
V(into radio) Beckett, I need a medical team down here, STAT.
p742
sg4
I11
sa(dp743
g2
V(into radio) It's too late. They're gone.
p744
sg4
I7
sa(dp745
g2
V(into radio) Wagner and Johnson. I need a containment team here.
p746
sg4
I11
sa(dp747
g2
VPeople don't just see things and drop dead, Lieutenant. We've spent the last hour surveying unexplored areas of the city. I think Wagner and Johnson were exposed to something\u2014
p748
sg4
I29
sa(dp749
g2
VAnd if they were infected, there's a very good chance that we were too.

VAgreed. (into radio) Carson, you hear all that?

I8
sa(dp753

I4
sa(dp757

VEnd of discussion. Peterson, we're staying here. Actually, wait a second. (snapping his fingers in realization of something) Everyone, follow me.
p762
sg4
I21
sa(dp763
g2
VYes.
p764
sg4
I1
sa(dp765
g2
VThat's right. Don't worry. My motivations are based entirely on self-preservation.
p766
sg4
I11
sa(dp767
g2
VAll right. Let me spell this out for you, okay? If there is a bacterial agent and it is not airborne, then it should be relatively safe for us to look around as long as we take the proper precautions. However\u2026if it is an airborne agent, then there's a very good chance we've already been infected.
p768
sg4
I56
sa(dp769
g2
VThose men were only down there for 12 hours. Even if they were infected right away, that's an alarmingly short incubation period. Now, if anyone else is infected, as in, oh, I don't know, maybe us? Seconds are going to count, Lieutenant. All right, light. (taking a flashlight) Let's go.
p770

g2
VEverybody except Ford stay here. You think I'm going in there by myself? Uh-uh.
p776
sg4
I14
sa(dp777

VDon't touch anything.

sg4
I3
sa(dp779
g2
VThis is not good.
p780
sg4
I4
sa(dp781
g2
VYes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Doesn't appear to be networked in with the rest of the Ancient systems. In fact, if you look, it only contains information about the experiments that took place in this room. (into radio) Weir, it's McKay.
p782
sg4
I41
sa(dp783
g2
V(into radio) Where's Beckett?
p784
sg4
I4
sa(dp785
g2
V(into radio) Well, we seem to have stumbled across something that I find\u2026a little troubling.
p786
sg4
I15
sa(dp787
g2
V(into radio) I think we may have found an Ancient viral lab. Wagner and Johnson must have been exposed here. Now, it'd take weeks to sift through all this data, and there's no way of knowing whether the Ancients were just studying the viruses or actively creating them. Either way, the storm has done quite a number on this place, and I've got\u2014

VDumais! Get her off. Dumais!
p794
sg4
I5
sa(dp795
g2
V(shouting, into radio) Tell Beckett to pick up the pace. I've just lost another member of my team.
p796
sg4
I18
sa(dp797
g2
VWhat?
p798
sg4
I1
sa(dp799
g2
V(into radio) You need to send someone to stop him.
p800
sg4
I10
sa(dp801
g2
V(into radio) No, Elizabeth, it's not under control. He knows almost as much about Ancient technology as I do. At the very most, what you're doing will just slow him down.
p802
sg4
I31
sa(dp803
g2
VWell, Dumais seemed fine right up to the point where she wasn't.
p804
sg4
I12
sa(dp805
g2
VAny ideas?
p806
sg4
I2
sa(dp807
g2
VStop trying to convince me I'm fine, Carson. I think we all know better.
p808
sg4
I14
sa(dp809
g2
VAre we done here?
p810
sg4
I4
sa(dp811
g2
VI'm going to see what I can get from the database. Let me know what the autopsy shows up.
p812
sg4
I19
sa(dp813
g2
VOh, and tell your pathologists to start with their heads.
p814
sg4
I10
sa(dp815
g2
VShe did say, "brain aneurysm," right?
p816
sg4
I6
sa(dp817
g2
VThat's the best news I've heard all day. Let me show you something.
p818
sg4
I13
sa(dp819
g2
VI haven't read the entire entry because it's incredibly long, but this looks like our guy. Six-hour hibernation, recurring visions, and, best of all, so I've left it to last\u2014brain hemorrhage or aneurysms.
p820
sg4
I33
sa(dp821
g2
VYeah. Maybe there's something in here about how to\u2014 No!
p822
sg4
I10
sa(dp823
g2
VSorry.
p824
sg4
I1
sa(dp825
g2
V(emotionally) I've been seeing things.
p826
sg4
I5
sa(dp827
g2
VAbout an hour. First you think it's just your eyes playing tricks on you but eventually\u2014
p828
sg4
I16
sa(dp829
g2
VYou, too?
p830
sg4
I2
sa(dp831
g2
VIt's like a\u2026ghost.
p832
sg4
I3
sa(dp833
g2
VMe. She ran into Hays\u2026and me. We're next.
p834
sg4
I8
sa(dp835
g2
VIs this really necessary? I am about to die of a brain aneurysm. How does being attached to a heart monitor help?
p836
sg4
I22
sa(dp837
g2
VAt that point, I will cease to care.
p838
sg4
I8
sa(dp839
g2
VYes, the living!
p840
sg4
I3
sa(dp841
g2
VLook, I'm no MD, but wouldn't brain swelling on the visual cortex just mean that we experience washes of color or weird visual anomalies?
p842
sg4
I24
sa(dp843
g2
VYeah, that's my point. All of our visions are so similar. If they're the result of arterial swelling, wouldn't the visions we experience be more random?
p844
sg4
I26
sa(dp845
g2
VYeah, well, the things we're seeing are pretty damn identical!
p846
sg4
I10
sa(dp847
g2
VThere\u2019s a good chance\u2014
p848
sg4
I4
sa(dp849

VHays, it's not real. Remember, it's not real.

VDon't say "fine!" He's not fine. Do something!
p852
sg4

p854
sg4
I6
sa(dp855
g2
VI'm\u2026I'm\u2026 Listen, I have a sister. We're not close. I don't even know how you'd find her\u2014
p856
sg4
I17
sa(dp857
g2
VShe's the only family I really have, so someone should tell her what happened\u2026 And make it sound good, okay? Tell her I died saving someone\u2026kids. I died saving kids, a bunch of them\u2026 And, Zelenka I've got some theories on looping the power in the gate to charge a dummy ZPM. It probably won't work, but you should have someone look at it, because it might lead somewhere else.
p858
sg4
I70
sa(dp859
g2
VYou seriously have to stop interrupting my last thoughts. I mean, this is important stuff you need to hear. Now\u2026if you're here for more than a year, I've left some notes on how to roll blackouts to effectively maintain your power requirements, and-and-and\u2026 Oh! Tell everyone that I was inches away from a theory of unification, but the notes, they were lost when I died saving the\u2026
p860
sg4
I67
sa(dp861
g2
VYeah.
p862
sg4
I1
sa(dp863
g2
VOkay? I should be dead now.
p864
sg4
I6
sa(dp865
g2
VExactly the same time.
p866
sg4
I4
sa(dp867
g2
VOh, God. (smiling) I'm still here.
p868
sg4
I6
sa(dp869
g2
VInteresting?
p870
sg4
I1
sa(dp871
g2
VWell, I don't care. (giddy) I mean, I really don't care.
p872
sg4
I11
sa(dp873
g2
VIt's too accurate. How can something organic be that efficient?
p874
sg4
I10
sa(dp875
g2
VNo, no, no, I don't buy that. Most of the habitable planets we've encountered thus far are carbon copies of Earth in terms of environmental conditions. Unless\u2026
p876
sg4
I27
sa(dp877
g2
VIncubation to completion is exactly six hours. The visions are identical for all the infected, and the location of the aneurysm is the same for every single deceased.
p878
sg4
I28
sa(dp879
g2
VIt's a nanovirus, one manufactured to kill humans.
p880
sg4
I8
sa(dp881
g2
V(over radio) That's right.
p882
sg4
I4
sa(dp883
g2
V(into radio) Nanotechnology\u2026it's technology that operates on a nanite scale. It's around a billionth of a millimeter.
p884
sg4
I17
sa(dp885
g2
V(into radio) It's the whole idea of being able to swallow a pill and having a million little robots go to work and cure whatever ails you.
p886
sg4
I27
sa(dp887
g2
V(into radio) Yeah, they're no bigger than a single-celled organism, although instead of having a sole purpose of curing a disease or mending a blood vessel\u2026
p888
sg4
I26
sa(dp889
g2
V(into radio) Infecting others along the way as they can.
p890
sg4
I10
sa(dp891
g2
VI'm not so sure about that.
p892
sg4
I6
sa(dp893
g2
VI'll give you that they're equally terrifying, but why would the Wraith even create the equivalent of a WMD? They're killing us not because they sadistically want us dead, but because they need to consume us for food. Look, it would be like the equivalent of cattle farmers creating mad cow disease. I don't buy it.
p894
sg4
I56
sa(dp895
g2
V(into radio) What, so, wiping out the Wraith's food supply is a last-ditch consideration?
p896
sg4
I14
sa(dp897
g2
V(into radio) That doesn't explain the visions, either.
p898
sg4
I8
sa(dp899
g2
V(into radio) Good point.
p900
sg4
I4
sa(dp901
g2
V(over radio) Major Sheppard, this is McKay.
p902
sg4
I7
sa(dp903
g2
V(over radio) I could use your help at my lab.
p904
sg4
I10
sa(dp905
g2
V(into radio) Hays and I were infected at the same time. There's only one thing that explains why I survived.
p906
sg4
I20
sa(dp907
g2
V(into radio) Well, I'm human.
p908
sg4
I5
sa(dp909
g2
V(into radio) No, that's not going to do it.
p910
sg4
I9
sa(dp911
g2
VI know. I'm already on it.
p912
sg4
I6
sa(dp913
g2
VI've already told you, I am working on it.
p914
sg4
I9
sa(dp915
g2
V(into radio) Do you see it?
p916
sg4
I6
sa(dp917
g2
V(into radio) Yeah, that's the one.
p918
sg4
I6
sa(dp919
g2
V(into radio) Not today, no.
p920
sg4
I5
sa(dp921
g2
VWell, as small as they are, the nanovirus is still effectively just a machine run by a computer. The best way to knock out a computer is with an electromagnetic pulse. Thankfully, that's something we can do.
p922
sg4
I37
sa(dp923
g2
V(over radio) Well, it's not going to be necessary. The Ancient technology works differently than ours. An EM pulse shouldn't have any long-lasting effect on it.
p924
sg4
I26
sa(dp925
g2
V(into radio) Okay\u2026here we go.
p926
sg4
I5
sa(dp927
g2
V(into radio) Well, Sheppard's dialing up the most powerful pulse the generator can manage. It probably won't make it all the way down here, but it should affect most of the central tower. I imagine once it wipes out the virus, the city should return control of it to you and end the lockdown.
p928
sg4
I54
sa(dp929
g2
VIf the pulse works, it'll simply be a matter of walking you down to my lab, sitting you down in front of the EMP, and repeating the process. (into radio) Major?
p930
sg4
I31
sa(dp931
g2
V(over radio) Okay, there should be a red overload light.
p932
sg4
I10
sa(dp933
g2
V(over radio) Wait till it comes on, give it a good ten-count, and then discharge.
p934
sg4
I15
sa(dp935
g2
V(into radio) Don't worry. I've probably been around more EMPs than anyone.
p936
sg4
I12
sa(dp937
g2
V(into radio) Yes, that's a yes. You'll be fine\u2026
p938
sg4
I9
sa(dp939
g2
V(over radio) Anything?
p940
sg4
I3
sa(dp941
g2
V(into radio) Doubtful. Are you still locked out of the Ancient mainframe?
p942
sg4
I12
sa(dp943
g2
V(into radio) That is before we reset the sub-switch.
p944
sg4
I9
sa(dp945
g2
V(into radio) Look, it's fixable. It's fixable. We just need to use a little trial and error.
p946
sg4
I17
sa(dp947
g2
V(into radio) Yes.
p948
sg4
I3
sa(dp949
g2
V(into radio) Even if we were able to get the EMP generator back online, the chances are slim that we would ever be able to get it powerful enough.
p950
sg4
I29
sa(dp951
g2
V(into radio) The major is right. The only way to create an EMP strong enough to wipe these little guys out is\u2014
p952
sg4
I22
sa(dp953
g2
V(into radio) I know it sounds severe, but if the major was able to overload a naquadah generator twenty miles above the city, we'd be perfectly safe from a radiological standpoint, and the ensuing blast would be capable of creating a devastating electromagnetic shock wave. Definitely enough to knock this virus out.
p954
sg4
I52
sa(dp955
g2
V(into radio) You're only going to have thirty seconds once you release it before it explodes. You need to get as far away as you can.
p956
sg4
I26
sa(dp957
g2
V(into radio) You're welcome.
p958
sg4
I4
sa(dp959
g2
V(over radio) We should know almost right away. The pulse only lasts a couple of microseconds\u2014
p960
sg4
I16
sa(dp961
g2
VYou guys have a minute? We've been able to spend some quality time with the nanovirus samples.
p962
sg4
I17
sa(dp963
g2
VYes, also, upon further investigation, I think we can rule out that they were created by the Wraith. They're different than any Wraith technology we've come across thus far.
p964
sg4
I29
sa(dp965
g2
VI honestly don't know. Whoever they were, let's just hope that they're not still around.
p966
sg4
I15
sa(dp967
g2
VI'm on it.
p968
sg4
I3
sa(dp969
g2
VShe's right. The darts are short-range fighters. There's probably a hive ship around here somewhere.
p970
sg4
I15
sa(dp971
g2
VI'm almost there!
p972
sg4
I3
sa(dp973
g2
VOkay, you should have weapons now.
p974
sg4
I6
sa(dp975
g2
VAre you sure?
p976
sg4
I3
sa(dp977
g2
VI'm pretty sure I fixed it.
p978
sg4
I6
sa(dp979
g2
VIt's not like I'm holding back on you.
p980
sg4
I8
sa(dp981
g2
V(walking forward, breathless) I thought for sure we were dead. Didn't you think we were dead?
p982
sg4
I16
sa(dp983
g2
VSome sort of uh, energy weapon?
p984
sg4
I6
sa(dp985
g2
VYeah.
p986
sg4
I1
sa(dp987
g2
VSo just to confirm, we're all still\u2026definitely not dead.
p988
sg4
I9
sa(dp989
g2
VGood. Same here.
p990
sg4
I3
sa(dp991
g2
VI already said, it's some sort of an energy weapon, one that apparently destroys Wraith darts.
p992
sg4
I16
sa(dp993
g2
VWell assuming that we're still alive, and there doesn't appear to be any damage as a result of the pulse, I think we can safely conclude that, uh\u2026 um\u2026 um\u2026 I got nothing. I mean, I got nothing to conclude. I'm just talking for the sake of talking.
p994

sa(dp999
g2
VAll right, we need to get down there.
p1000
sg4

g2
VI'm picking up everything, just nothing worth mentioning.
p1002

I8
sa(dp1003

VIs, um\u2026Athar around? We'd love to talk to him. We're, uh, friends.
p1004
sg4
I12
sa(dp1005
g2
VOf course. Hi, Athar.
p1006
sg4
I4
sa(dp1007
g2
VWell, this planet is protected by an Ancient weapon. This just confirms it.
p1008
sg4
I13
sa(dp1009
g2
VWell, there's no other explanation. I mean, the power requirements of something like that must be astronomical. Only a ZPM could generate that.
p1010
sg4
I23
sa(dp1011
g2
VWe just need access to that weapon\u2014better still, the ZPM\u2014not that we'd steal it or anything.
p1012

VI'm always on my best behavior.

I3
sa(dp1017
g2
VOh, good. See, we could have taken the jumper.
p1018

I9
sa(dp1019
g2
VOh, please. One of the abbots ran ahead.
p1020
sg4
I8
sa(dp1021

sa(dp1023
g2
VOh, please.
p1024
sg4
I2
sa(dp1025
g2
VThis is as good as it gets, Major. Chaya, the only reason we're alive is because of a powerful energy weapon that emanated from somewhere on the surface of this planet. It destroyed the ships that were shooting at us. That weapon is what's keeping the Wraith away.

VTechnically, she's in a state of metabolic stasis. Aging slowed considerably, yes, but not entirely suspended.
p1166

p1168

VI'm not saying it's too big. I'm just pointing out its dimensions.
p1192
sg4
I12
sa(dp1193
g2
VAnd I was just saying there's no way of knowing in the short term. It'd be like searching every room in every building in Manhattan. It'll take a while. God knows what other kinds of surprises are out there, not showing up on the sensors.
p1194

p1198
sg4
I21
sa(dp1199
g2
VWell, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, there's nothing in the laws of physics to prevent it. Extremely difficult to achieve, mind you. You need the technology to manipulate black holes to create wormholes not only through points in space, but time.

sa(dp1201
g2
VDon't even get me started on that movie.
p1202
sg4
I8
sa(dp1203
g2
VI know what you're thinking. If she's been waiting in that stasis chamber all these millennia for us to arrive, why didn't the system automatically attempt to revive her the moment we got here? Answer? It did. I've been going over the data from our arrival. One of the first things we noticed was a sudden power surge in the section of the city where the stasis lab was. It was trying to revive her, only we didn't know that. All we saw was more power draining from an already nearly depleted ZPM, so we shut down all secondary systems. I almost killed her.  You. How weird is that?
p1204
sg4
I109
sa(dp1205
g2
V(smiling) Actually, how you will be, will be different than how she is right now. See, the moment she went back in time she created a separate reality, a second you, living in a\u2014in a parallel world. According to one of many interpretations of quantum theory. I mean, simply put, this interpretation states that the universe is, in fact, split into an infinite number of copies of itself in which every possible outcome to every decision ever made all exists somewhere in this infinitely layered "multi-universe."
p1206
sg4
I86
sa(dp1207
g2
VYeah, in a nutshell.
p1208
sg4
I4
sa(dp1209
g2
V(speaking quickly) Yes, yes, yes, yes. We got your note. And forgive my bluntness, but we really need to know everything about your encounter with the Ancients, beginning at the point where you went back in time. Specifically, how you went back in time, because that would be very useful for us\u2014
p1210
sg4
I52

g2
VThis must be the control room. This-this is obviously their version of a DHD.
p1212
sg4
I14
sa(dp1213
g2
VThis area is probably power control systems, some sort of a computer interface of some kind.
p1214
sg4
I16
sa(dp1215
g2
VWell, see, that's the hitch. We've got lights coming on all over the city, air starting to circulate, but no power coming out of these consoles, so\u2026
p1216
sg4
I27
sa(dp1217
g2
VWait a minute. Back up a second. That isn't the way it happened. Everything came online when we arrived. It was lights, computers, power control systems, everything. I was able to access the database immediately.
p1218
sg4
I35
sa(dp1219
g2
VWhat are you saying? The city didn't rise the first time 'round?
p1220
sg4
I12
sa(dp1221
g2
VWe're trying to interface these consoles with a temporary battery power, see if we can access the city's main power systems and get this place up and running.
p1222

I28
sa(dp1223
g2
VHow we doing over there?
p1224
sg4
I5
sa(dp1225

VWell, let's see what we can do, then.
p1226
sg4
I8
sa(dp1227
g2
VOh, no. (into radio) Dr. Weir, I need to see you in the control room immediately.
p1228
sg4
I16
sa(dp1229
g2
VThe city has a shield, some sort of an energy force field holding the water back. That is, it had a shield. The power systems are nearing maximum entropy. Our arrival hastened their depletion, big time.
p1230
sg4
I36
sa(dp1231
g2
VI mean, you can see, the shield is collapsing rapidly. Several sections of the city are already flooded.
p1232
sg4
I18
sa(dp1233
g2
VI doubt our Naquadah generators can supply enough power to sustain the shield, and we probably don't have time to try. When I say rapidly collapsing, I mean rapidly.
p1234
sg4
I29
sa(dp1235
g2
VWe can't. Whatever power's left in the system has been diverted to sustaining the shield holding the ocean back.
p1236
sg4
I19
sa(dp1237
g2
VThe shield might've held the water back for another 100 years, but power consumption spiked when we arrived.
p1238
sg4
I18
sa(dp1239
g2
VYes.
p1240
sg4
I1
sa(dp1241
g2
VI'll try to interface the gate with one of our generators. Hopefully there's enough time. Grodin, access the Stargate control systems, see if you can locate any gate addresses in the database. Won't be nearly enough power to gate back to Earth, but maybe we'll have enough to gate elsewhere in Pegasus.
p1242
sg4
I52
sa(dp1243
g2
V(into radio) I'll see if I can pull up a schematic, find a way out.
p1244
sg4
I15
sa(dp1245
g2
VOh, no.
p1246
sg4
I2
sa(dp1247

p1248
sg4
I21
sa(dp1249
g2
VIt's too little, too late. Most of the rooms are already breached. We've got people trapped with water rising.
p1250
sg4
I19
sa(dp1251
g2
VI'll try to override the system, open the doors, but that's seriously hampering efforts to rig power to the Stargate.

VYes, yes, yes, I heard. Go.
p1254

V(into radio) I'm trying!
p1260

p1262

p1264

g2
VI'm sure if I had a few more seconds, I could\u2014
p1272
sg4
I11
sa(dp1273

I7
sa(dp1293

V(holding up the parchment) Really? See this? This is a charcoal rubbing taken from an Ancient temple built about the time Weir's list was written. Notice anything familiar? Hmm? It's a ZPM. Look, we are close, closer than we have ever been before. Now, there may very well be hundreds of zero-point modules hidden in this galaxy, but the only one we are remotely sure of is here. Here. (somberly) Now, if you ever want to go home, if you ever want to protect Atlantis from the Wraith, we need to find this.
p1294
sg4
I93
sa(dp1295
g2
VAccording to legend, an Ancient from Atlantis came through the stargate and entrusted a sect of Sudarian priests with a rare treasure, or "Potentia," as they called it. This Lantian told them to keep it hidden from the Wraith at all costs. Now, the Sudarian people worshiped the Ancients and considered the Potentia their most sacred artifact. Now, predictably, they did exactly as the Ancient requested.
p1296
sg4
I66
sa(dp1297
g2
VFrom what I can tell, they only brought it out of hiding to be displayed on high holidays. I'd be surprised if they knew it could be used. And that is good news.
p1298
sg4
I33
sa(dp1299
g2
VThe bad news however, is that after ten thousand years of Wraith culling, Sudarian society is essentially extinct. The planet's inhabitants are only at a Renaissance level of development, but with the help of some of our gear, I really think they could make some headway.

p1324
sg4
I10
sa(dp1325
g2
VThey're buried in a grid. Look, we couldn't have done this without the number three stone. That, along with the number seven stone gives us two diagonally opposed corners. From that, you can extrapolate exactly how big the grid is, and therefore where each of the other stones should be buried.
p1326

p1410
sg4
I5

p1468
sg4
I3
sa(dp1469

VPossibly. Look, Pranos was right. The center stone\u2019s the only one that locks into place. All the others must move around it. I'm just trying to think of a combination that make sense with five in the middle.

p1546

g2
VWell, approximately 1.3 seconds, give or take.
p1548
sg4
I7
sa(dp1549
g2
VDon't be so analog. 1.3 seconds is more than enough time to send a message if it's in the form of a high compression data burst. Now, I helped refine the encoding for the U.S. Air Force a few years back. Colonel Carter should be able to decipher it on the other side.
p1550

Now, my extensive education, training, and firsthand experience in the field of astrophysics has given me a unique perspective that few on Earth\u2014or, well, on any other planet, for that matter\u2014can match.

But, you know, you should know I think you are just so\u2026well, you're great, you're really, really great. And I would go so far as saying that you're the hottest scientist I've ever worked with.

And since your father refused to pay for a license, the animal shelter has no way of tracking him. You know, God knows what happened to that little guy. Now, cats\u2026now, that's a whole different story. I mean, cats are self-sufficient, they're dependable, you shake the box, they come running. The cynic would say it's because of the food, but my cat, see, I truly believe he enjoys my company.

Now, I know what you're thinking. I've never really been the poster child for that kind of sentiment, but when one's contemplating one's own demise, one tends to see things more clearly. I really do wish you the best, you know, and I'm sorry we weren't closer. Perhaps, um\u2026 If by chance, I make it out of this, perhaps one day we can be. And I would like that. Now, if there's time, I'd like to go back to the subject of leadership.

VSince we got here, we've uncovered a number of defensive weapons systems beyond the shield\u2014
p1618
sg4
I15
sa(dp1619
g2
VI was going to say that.
p1620
sg4
I6
sa(dp1621
g2
VYes, but the point is this may not be our best chance.
p1622
sg4
I12

VOf course, like the shield, power will be our biggest problem.

p1632

I10
sa(dp1633

VWell, you know how much I love women with great, um\u2026minds. Just don't say anything to anyone.
p1634
sg4
I17
sa(dp1635
g2
VRight. Very good. Excellent.
p1636
sg4
I4
sa(dp1637
g2
VI've got something here.
p1638
sg4
I4
sa(dp1639
g2
VI don't know. I've got a little\u2026

g2
VPicking up a faint energy signal. It's getting stronger. Coming from here.
p1642
sg4
I12
sa(dp1643
g2
VWell, the magic Ancient device hasn't lied yet.
p1644
sg4
I8
sa(dp1645
g2
VWell, there's definitely something weird here.
p1646
sg4
I6
sa(dp1647
g2
VMaybe if you got a good running start. You know, really slam into it.
p1648
sg4
I14

p1650
sg4
I7
sa(dp1651
g2
VElizabeth.
p1652
sg4
I1
sa(dp1653
g2
VCertainly looks that way. Some sort of hidden, secret facility. It's obviously been abandoned for a very long time. I was able to pull this data recorder from one of the computer consoles.
p1654
sg4
I33
sa(dp1655
g2
VI have no idea. I'm hoping this thing will tell us.
p1656
sg4
I11
sa(dp1657
g2
VHere we go. There. Now, that, uh\u2026 That means absolutely nothing to me. The last time I saw the contents of one of these, it showed a galactic positioning system for ships. It was more, um\u2026pictures than symbols.
p1658
sg4
I38
sa(dp1659
g2
VJust so you know, you didn't actually finish that sentence out loud.
p1660

g2
VWraith language?
p1662
sg4
I2
sa(dp1663
g2
VKnock yourself out. I have to get back to the control chair anyway.
p1664
sg4
I13
sa(dp1665
g2
VThere's nowhere near enough power in the thing to do anything.
p1666
sg4
I11
sa(dp1667
g2
VAnd in order to do that, it needs to be on.
p1668
sg4
I11
sa(dp1669
g2
VYeah, but I can't be trying to analyze the feedback data while I'm concentrating on keeping the damn thing activated.
p1670
sg4
I20
sa(dp1671
g2
VWell, not good.
p1672
sg4
I3
sa(dp1673
g2
VYeah, but we're using him.
p1674
sg4
I5
sa(dp1675
g2
VYou've got to be kidding me.
p1676
sg4
I6
sa(dp1677
g2
VWell, that doesn't categorically mean\u2014
p1678
sg4
I5
sa(dp1679
g2
VAll right, we'll try Dr. Kusanagi again.
p1680
sg4
I7
sa(dp1681
g2
VNow.
p1682
sg4
I1
sa(dp1683
g2
VThank you.
p1684
sg4
I2
sa(dp1685
g2
VWell, and some other things.
p1686
sg4
I5
sa(dp1687
g2
VWhat, so you think this Wraith scientist was trying to make humans what, more tasty?
p1688
sg4
I15
sa(dp1689
g2
VI thought you already said they had a number of genetic characteristics similar to humans.
p1690
sg4
I15
sa(dp1691
g2
VOr negligence.
p1692
sg4
I2
sa(dp1693
g2
VYes, but for the moment, all we know is that the Ancients might have accidentally created the Wraith, and why Teyla can sense them coming. I mean, fabulous, mystery solved, but neither of which that help, in any way, stop them from coming.
p1694
sg4
I43
sa(dp1695
g2
VThank you.
p1696
sg4
I2
sa(dp1697
g2
VAll right, even with Major Sheppard in the chair, we weren't able to, uh\u2026
p1698
sg4
I14
sa(dp1699
g2
VWhat? What is that?
p1700
sg4
I4
sa(dp1701
g2
VI thought we decided there were more important things\u2014
p1702
sg4
I9
sa(dp1703
g2
VWhat would I have said that would make you think that?
p1704
sg4
I11
sa(dp1705
g2
VWell, it's just\u2026 It's a good point. I'm just wondering what I said 'cause\u2026 Sorry. What have you got?
p1706
sg4
I19
sa(dp1707
g2
VSee, now you've got me wondering why the rest of the Wraith didn't want these experiments taking place in the first place.
p1708
sg4
I22
sa(dp1709
g2
VEspecially since they were supposed to be intended to improve things for everyone.
p1710
sg4
I13
sa(dp1711
g2
VI just said it.
p1712
sg4
I4
sa(dp1713
g2
VI don't understand. I mean, why let them back into the general population, then?
p1714
sg4
I14
sa(dp1715
g2
VBefore he realized he was wrong, it was too late.
p1716
sg4
I10
sa(dp1717
g2
VOkay, so how does this help us?
p1718
sg4
I7
sa(dp1719
g2
VWhat? You're saying you think Teyla might be able to\u2026tap into this Wraith psychic network?
p1720
sg4
I15
sa(dp1721
g2
VNot only has Teyla been able to ascertain that the Wraith are more interested in Earth than Atlantis \u2014 which is, you know, terrifying \u2014 she realized that the hive ships will go right past the only surviving Lagrangian Point satellite.
p1722
sg4
I41
sa(dp1723
g2
VYes, yes, yes. The point is, we think we can use it to our advantage.
p1724
sg4
I15
sa(dp1725
g2
VIt is, but we think we've learned enough about how it works to bring it back.
p1726
sg4
I16
sa(dp1727
g2
VYes, of course, if we're right about what's wrong with it. But if we're right, and it's just out of power, the Wraith have simply been ignoring it.
p1728
sg4
I28
sa(dp1729
g2
VWell, according to the Ancient database, it should be able to take out all three when fully charged. Keep in mind that the Ancient technology is far superior. They only lost the war because they were vastly outnumbered.
p1730
sg4
I38
sa(dp1731
g2
VIn military parlance, surprise\u2026is an element on our side.
p1732
sg4
I9
sa(dp1733
g2
VThe satellite's fifteen hours away by puddle jumper. I recommend that we put together a small crew. Say, myself, Grodin\u2026and a pilot.
p1734
sg4
I22
sa(dp1735
g2
VThe hive ships will be in range of the satellite in 49 hours. We're going to need every last second of that time.
p1736
sg4
I23
sa(dp1737
g2
VI think I can handle this alone, Radek. Is there not something better you could be doing?
p1738
sg4
I17
sa(dp1739
g2
VYes, I agree. Go.
p1740
sg4
I4
sa(dp1741
g2
VWhy?
p1742
sg4
I1
sa(dp1743
g2
VGenerous of you.
p1744
sg4
I3
sa(dp1745
g2
VOkay, I think I see where this is going now.
p1746
sg4
I10
sa(dp1747
g2
VThere's not going to be a problem.
p1748
sg4
I7
sa(dp1749
g2
VIf it seems like we can't fix it, we'll just turn around and come back. Now, I realize I'm invaluable everywhere, but\u2014
p1750
sg4
I22
sa(dp1751
g2
VSorry. Nope. You can't take it back because you've just admitted that I am smarter than you are.
p1752
sg4
I18
sa(dp1753
g2
VOh, it was hard for you to say but the truth shone through, and you were compelled to speak.
p1754
sg4
I19
sa(dp1755
g2
VHey, hey, hey, hey. Let's not ruin the moment here, huh? Now\u2026keep an eye on my city for me while I'm gone, hmm?
p1756
sg4
I23
sa(dp1757
g2
VRight. All right.
p1758
sg4
I3
sa(dp1759
g2
VUnderstood.
p1760
sg4
I1
sa(dp1761
g2
VOkay. Close the bulkhead doors.
p1762
sg4
I5
sa(dp1763
g2
VRight.
p1764
sg4
I1
sa(dp1765
g2
VYes, why?
p1766
sg4
I2
sa(dp1767
g2
VYeah, well, feeling a little claustrophobic. How much air do these things hold, anyways?
p1768
sg4
I14
sa(dp1769
g2
VWell, that's enough, right? I mean even with the heavy breathing? I imagine they would calculate that in, right?
p1770
sg4
I19
sa(dp1771
g2
VYeah, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one with the eight-hour ceiling on their breathing.
p1772
sg4
I18
sa(dp1773
g2
VIt's completely dead.
p1774
sg4
I3
sa(dp1775
g2
VI'm going to hook up the naquadah generator. See if I can get some life support going.
p1776
sg4
I17
sa(dp1777
g2
VHere we go.
p1778
sg4
I3
sa(dp1779
g2
VGreat, just give me a second to\u2014
p1780
sg4
I7
sa(dp1781
g2
V(rolling over slowly) Oh! Oh, yeah. Yep. That's permanent back damage.
p1782
sg4
I11
sa(dp1783
g2
VWell, you assumed with my life.
p1784
sg4
I6
sa(dp1785
g2
VWhat do you got?
p1786
sg4
I4
sa(dp1787
g2
VAh, details. Let's get to work.
p1788
sg4
I6
sa(dp1789
g2
VOh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, yep. That's vertebra damage. That's a life of pain. Oh.
p1790
sg4
I16
sa(dp1791
g2
VWell, then why isn't it\u2014 Okay. All right. Let's just step back here. Think about it. This baby is a directed energy beam weapon. Runs off a relatively low-yield charge, like our naquadah generator. So that means it's got to be continually building up a charge in some kind of a buffer or a capacitor until it's discharged.
p1792
sg4
I58
sa(dp1793
g2
VOkay, so power is getting to the buffer, it's just not getting to the actual weapon.
p1794
sg4
I16
sa(dp1795
g2
VOkay, we've got 29 hours till showtime, so let's hope we don't have to order parts, huh?
p1796
sg4
I17
sa(dp1797
g2
VHa. Schematics, anyone?
p1798
sg4
I3
sa(dp1799
g2
VI guess our guy took a hit. Must have disrupted the main power conduit.
p1800
sg4
I14
sa(dp1801
g2
VYou know, your masterful grip on the blatantly obvious continues to impress me, Peter.
p1802
sg4
I14
sa(dp1803
g2
VAll right. We need to\u2026route power around these damaged circuits. We do that, we should be laughing. All right, I'm disoriented. Where are these?
p1804
sg4
I24
sa(dp1805
g2
VWhat?
p1806
sg4
I1
sa(dp1807
g2
VOh, great.
p1808
sg4
I2
sa(dp1809
g2
VThere's nothing to hang on to.
p1810
sg4
I6
sa(dp1811
g2
VOkay. So who goes?
p1812
sg4
I4
sa(dp1813
g2
VOh, brilliant. Okay, Miller, break out the straws.
p1814
sg4
I8
sa(dp1815
g2
VOkay. On three. One, two, three\u2026 Okay. Obviously rock, paper, scissors, doesn't work with three. Anyone have a pencil?
p1816
sg4
I19
sa(dp1817
g2
VWell, get on with it.
p1818
sg4
I5
sa(dp1819
g2
V(to Grodin) You go first.
p1820
sg4
I5
sa(dp1821

I1
sa(dp1825
g2
VYeah.
p1826

sa(dp1827
g2
VMm, flatter the dead man. Good.
p1828
sg4
I6
sa(dp1829
g2
V(into radio) Okay, Miller. I want you to vent the atmosphere and disengage the artificial gravity in the rear compartment.
p1830
sg4
I20
sa(dp1831
g2
VOkay. Open the rear hatch.
p1832
sg4
I5
sa(dp1833
g2
VOh, my.
p1834
sg4
I2
sa(dp1835
g2
VHaven't quite left the rear of the jumper yet.
p1836
sg4
I9
sa(dp1837
g2
VYes, please do. Remind me. Are we on a tight schedule?
p1838
sg4
I11
sa(dp1839
g2
VOkay. Thank you. One small step, huh?
p1840
sg4
I7
sa(dp1841
g2
VOne giant leap!
p1842
sg4
I3
sa(dp1843
g2
VI made it.
p1844
sg4
I3
sa(dp1845
g2
VLet's take a look at this first panel.
p1846
sg4
I8
sa(dp1847
g2
VThis is bad. Very bad. I'm not sure I can fix this.
p1848
sg4
I12
sa(dp1849
g2
VWho told you that?
p1850
sg4
I4
sa(dp1851
g2
VWell, you're right. It's probably a good thing I drew the short straw.
p1852
sg4
I13
sa(dp1853
g2
VThe main power conduit's been severed. There may be some way for me to reroute it so it's going through secondary conduits sort of like\u2026a quadruple bypass.
p1854
sg4
I27
sa(dp1855
g2
VWe're only going to have time to try this once. Let's get started.
p1856
sg4
I13
sa(dp1857
g2
VOkay, that's all I can do from here. Is the power getting through?
p1858
sg4
I13
sa(dp1859
g2
VOh, thank God. Okay, I'm going to end this EVA. We're coming in. We're going to pick you up and get the hell out of here.
p1860
sg4
I26
sa(dp1861
g2
VAll right.
p1862
sg4
I2
sa(dp1863
g2
VPeter, we're having trouble docking with the satellite. See what you can do from your side.
p1864

g2
V(over radio) \u201cOh, dear," what?
p1866
sg4
I5
sa(dp1867
g2
VAll right, well, we'll do it manually, like we did the first time.
p1868
sg4
I13
sa(dp1869
g2
VThen we'll\u2026 Look, I'll go back and reroute the power.
p1870
sg4
I10
sa(dp1871
g2
VI know what I'm doing now.
p1872
sg4

g2
VPeter\u2014
p1876
sg4
I1
sa(dp1877

p1878
sg4
I12

V(into radio) Dr. Weir, it's McKay. The satellite is armed and ready. It should fire within the next minute or so. Keep your fingers crossed.

VWe're heading back in to pick you up.
p1894

p1896

g2
VOh, god!
p1900
sg4
I2
sa(dp1901
g2
V(upset, into radio) Atlantis, this is McKay. We have lost the satellite.
p1902
sg4
I12
sa(dp1903
g2
VNegative. Two other hive ships are intact. Elizabeth\u2026Peter Grodin was aboard the satellite.
p1904
sg4
I13
sa(dp1905
g2
VThey're not coming any closer. It looks like they're rethinking their plans. At the very least\u2026he has bought us some time.

p1922

VThey must have found a ZPM. That's the only way they could have dialed in from Earth.
p1924
sg4
I17
sa(dp1925

p1928

p1932
sg4

p1936
sg4
I4

VElizabeth. Excuse me. I've hooked up the generator, and the chair platform is operational.
p1948
sg4
I14
sa(dp1949
g2
VNot so much.
p1950
sg4
I3
sa(dp1951
g2
VWe're down to just a few dozen drones.
p1952
sg4
I8
sa(dp1953
g2
VThere was no way of determining that until the chair was initialized, and that was only possible once the Mark II was tied in.
p1954
sg4
I24
sa(dp1955
g2
VYes. I know. They were probably used defending Atlantis the first time the Wraith attacked the Ancients.
p1956
sg4
I17
sa(dp1957
g2
VBecause they're rocks\u2026 Asteroids. The Wraith must have harvested them from this system's asteroid belt and accelerated them towards us from a safe distance. The mainframe's taken this long to determine that they were a threat.
p1958
sg4
I36
sa(dp1959
g2
VOh, yeah. Even if most of them burn off in the atmosphere, but\u2026that's not why they're doing it.
p1960
sg4
I18
sa(dp1961
g2
VWell\u2026that's that. Your mines make one hell of a bang, Colonel. I'm sure the Wraiths' ears are ringing.
p1962
sg4
I18
sa(dp1963
g2
VThere's no way of knowing. The mine detonations must have overloaded the sensors.
p1964
sg4
I13
sa(dp1965
g2
VIt'll keep us blind for hours.
p1966
sg4
I6
sa(dp1967
g2
VIt'll take a minute.
p1968
sg4
I4
sa(dp1969
g2
VLook, this generator can only power the chair because it operates in a state of barely-controlled overload\u2014
p1970
sg4
I17
sa(dp1971
g2
VThat's what I'm trying to do.
p1972
sg4
I6
sa(dp1973
g2
VYou've got power. Go!
p1974
sg4
I4
sa(dp1975
g2
VPower is out in sections of the city. The long-range scanners and the internal sensors are down, but we're working on it.
p1976
sg4
I22
sa(dp1977
g2
VThey're coming. That's their status. Tomorrow, the day after, the day after that\u2014eventually, they'll get here. Whether we're here to greet them or not is another matter.
p1978
sg4
I27
sa(dp1979
g2
VLook, the chair is out of drones. How do you expect to handle the next wave?
p1980
sg4
I16
sa(dp1981
g2
VReally?
p1982
sg4
I1
sa(dp1983
g2
VI knew this was going to happen.
p1984
sg4
I7
sa(dp1985
g2
VYes, it's a fact. Look, you show up here with your guns and your brush cuts, but when it comes to actually saving the city you turn to the scientists\u2026 And every time, what you ask is impossible.
p1986
sg4
I38
sa(dp1987
g2
VShut up. I have an idea.
p1988
sg4
I6
sa(dp1989
g2
VOf course, the chair. The problem is tying it to the Jumper's systems.
p1990
sg4
I13
sa(dp1991
g2
VPossibly using the drones on the Jumpers themselves as a means of propulsion\u2014
p1992
sg4
I13
sa(dp1993
g2
VIt won't be very maneuverable, but possibly, possibly\u2026
p1994
sg4
I8
sa(dp1995
g2
VNo, it's a "possibly."
p1996
sg4
I4
sa(dp1997
g2
VI am exhausted and starving, so sit down. Carson, it's out of drones. You couldn't do any damage if you wanted to.
p1998
sg4
I22
sa(dp1999
g2
VThank you. Okay, we're in business. (to Zelenka) Head down to the Jumper bay. Radio me when you get there.
p2000
sg4
I20
sa(dp2001
g2
V(into radio) Okay\u2026 Let's give it a test.
p2002
sg4
I8
sa(dp2003
g2
VCarson I need you to clear your mind and think about the Puddle Jumper. Think about bringing it online.
p2004
sg4
I19
sa(dp2005
g2
VCarson\u2026 Look, I know you can do this. Just activate the Puddle Jumper.
p2006
sg4
I13
sa(dp2007
g2
VThank God.
p2008
sg4
I2
sa(dp2009
g2
V(into radio) Prototypes. Right.
p2010
sg4
I4
sa(dp2011
g2
VWe have a problem.
p2012
sg4
I4
sa(dp2013
g2
VI just finished examining the Genii nuclear devices. They're incomplete. I could finish it, but it's going to take time.
p2014
sg4
I20
sa(dp2015
g2
VAbout a day.
p2016
sg4
I3
sa(dp2017
g2
VWell, like I said, we have a problem.
p2018
sg4
I8
sa(dp2019
g2
VYes, yes. I need something to keep me awake.
p2020
sg4
I9
sa(dp2021
g2
VWe're building nuclear bombs here. Staying awake is sort of a prerequisite.
p2022
sg4
I12
sa(dp2023
g2
VThank you.
p2024
sg4
I2
sa(dp2025
g2
VOh, what a coincidence. We're done. (leaning over in exhaustion) Oh\u2026
p2026
sg4
I11
sa(dp2027
g2
VRight.
p2028
sg4
I1
sa(dp2029
g2
VThe generator's not powering up like it should be.
p2030
sg4
I9
sa(dp2031
g2
VThere's something wrong. Power levels are dropping!
p2032
sg4
I7
sa(dp2033
g2
V(over radio) We must have exhausted the Mark II's energy output. It's dead!
p2034
sg4
I13
sa(dp2035
g2
VThere's got to be a way to\u2026 (seeing Sheppard is gone) Major!
p2036
sg4
I12
sa(dp2037
g2
VHe's right, they're beaming in all over the place.
p2038
sg4
I9
sa(dp2039
g2
VYou let Sheppard fly that jumper?
p2040
sg4
I6
sa(dp2041
g2
VHave you got your eye on anyone?
p2042
sg4
I7
sa(dp2043
g2
VActually, I was talking to the mouse, but now you mention it, some of those Athosian women are pretty hot, and we did just save them from the Wraith, so we've got to trade on that while you can, you know, before they discover we're not actually that cool.
p2044
sg4
I49
sa(dp2045
g2
VWell, you know me, always eager to help.
p2046
sg4
I8
sa(dp2047
g2
VUh, yeah. I'm sorry, medicine is about as much of a science as is, oh, I don't know, voodoo. All I need to know is that will enable me to use Ancient technology like Major Sheppard, or yourself.
p2048
sg4
I38
sa(dp2049
g2
VWell, why now? I mean, if it's possible, we knew we'd need as many people with the gene as we could get.
p2050
sg4
I22
sa(dp2051
g2
V(worried) And completely safe?
p2052
sg4
I4
sa(dp2053
g2
VMaybe you should tell me more.
p2054
sg4
I6
sa(dp2055
g2
V(higher pitched) A mouse retrovirus?
p2056
sg4
I5
sa(dp2057
g2
V(still worried) Are there any side\u2026
p2058
sg4
I6
sa(dp2059
g2
V\u2026effects?
p2060
sg4
I1
sa(dp2061
g2
V(pained) Oh, that's very amusing. So how long until it starts working?
p2062
sg4
I12
sa(dp2063
g2
VOh, something I found in one of the research labs, something the, uh, Ancients were experimenting with.
p2064
sg4
I17
sa(dp2065
g2
VUh\u2026pretty sure.
p2066
sg4
I2
sa(dp2067
g2
V(heard from distance) Okay, I'm ready.
p2068
sg4
I6
sa(dp2069
g2
VI'm fine.
p2070
sg4
I2
sa(dp2071
g2
VLook, Beckett's gene therapy worked. I was able to activate this. It's a, uh, personal shield, acts like a, uh, protective skin, and it must have inertial dampening properties, too, because I didn't feel a thing. Watch this. (to Grodin) Hit me.
p2072
sg4
I42
sa(dp2073
g2
VYou didn't have to swing so hard. And notice that he didn't even hesitate!
p2074
sg4
I14
sa(dp2075
g2
VOh, believe me, that's not the first thing we tried.
p2076
sg4
I10
sa(dp2077
g2
V(elated) I'm invulnerable.
p2078
sg4
I3
sa(dp2079
g2
V(in sing-song) In-vulner-able.
p2080
sg4
I3
sa(dp2081
g2
V(muttering) You're just jealous.
p2082
sg4
I4
sa(dp2083
g2
VThis could be a problem. I can't get at it.
p2084
sg4
I10
sa(dp2085
g2
VAre you guys done?
p2086
sg4
I4
sa(dp2087
g2
V(sarcastically) Oh, let's all have a toast.
p2088
sg4
I7
sa(dp2089
g2
VThat's great.
p2090
sg4
I2
sa(dp2091
g2
VWell, thank you. I'm hungry already. What am I going to do? If I don't get this stupid thing off, I'll be dead by the end of the day.
p2092
sg4
I29
sa(dp2093
g2
VYeah, I'm talking about food.
p2094
sg4
I5
sa(dp2095
g2
VOh, yeah, there were some explicit instructions, which I chose to completely ignore.
p2096
sg4
I13
sa(dp2097
g2
VJust shut up. I'm thinking.
p2098
sg4
I5
sa(dp2099
g2
VI'm a dead man.
p2100
sg4
I4
sa(dp2101
g2
VThat's very important. I mean you never know. Even a tiny, little, innocuous-looking thing can\u2026can kill you.
p2102
sg4
I17
sa(dp2103
g2
V(raising his hand) Dead man talking.
p2104
sg4
I6
sa(dp2105
g2
VWell, don't bother giving me one.
p2106
sg4
I6
sa(dp2107
g2
VSorry.

sg4
I1
sa(dp2109
g2
VEver seen a twenty kiloton nuclear explosion?
p2110
sg4
I7
sa(dp2111
g2
VFunny.
p2112
sg4
I1
sa(dp2113
g2
VCheerleaders.
p2114
sg4
I1
sa(dp2115
g2
VWe don't have nearly enough power to activate the whole city at one time.
p2116
sg4
I14
sa(dp2117
g2
VAnd for all we know, there could be shielded areas or, uh,\u2026 (pointing) malfunctioning sensors. We are getting a pretty strange energy reading in one of the unexplored areas across the city.
p2118
sg4
I32
sa(dp2119
g2
VDone.
p2120
sg4
I1
sa(dp2121
g2
VStill got lights.
p2122
sg4
I3
sa(dp2123
g2
VI don't know.
p2124
sg4
I3
sa(dp2125
g2
VWe've only been here for a couple of days.
p2126
sg4
I9
sa(dp2127
g2
VThis stuff is pretty old. It's that, or there really are ghosts.
p2128
sg4
I12
sa(dp2129
g2
VIt could have something to do with the interfaces between our naquadah generators and the city. Well, that, or the way we isolated certain systems could be causing erroneous operations in the Ancient programming.
p2130
sg4
I34
sa(dp2131
g2
VI never used to, then I learned about things called "Wraiths" that can suck the life out of you with their hands. What the hell is that?
p2132
sg4
I27
sa(dp2133
g2
VThanks.
p2134
sg4
I1
sa(dp2135
g2
VNot just for them.
p2136
sg4
I4
sa(dp2137
g2
VGo ahead.
p2138
sg4
I2
sa(dp2139
g2
VThere's got to be a better word.
p2140
sg4
I7
sa(dp2141
g2
VI passed out from\u2026manly hunger.
p2142
sg4
I5
sa(dp2143
g2
V(irritated) Oh, yeah, that's very sympathetic. Let's all mock the dying man. Thank you.
p2144
sg4
I14
sa(dp2145
g2
V(gesturing with a sealed power bar) If this thing feeds on energy, we could be in big trouble, and when I say "we," I mean "you," because I won't actually be around for much longer.
p2146
sg4
I35
sa(dp2147
g2
VWell, uh\u2026people also give off heat energy but now, granted, it's negligible compared to that of a naquadah generator, but you take away this thing's only other obvious source of food, and\u2014
p2148
sg4
I32
sa(dp2149
g2
VWell, I only know one thing for sure, and that is that flying darkness that eats energy can only be very, very bad.
p2150
sg4
I23
sa(dp2151
g2
VSomeone thought it would make a nice closet.
p2152
sg4
I8
sa(dp2153
g2
VJust before he disappeared, we got an unusual energy reading from this area here.
p2154
sg4
I14
sa(dp2155
g2
VWait, wait, wait. No, no\u2026
p2156
sg4
I5
sa(dp2157
g2
VIt must be a transporter.
p2158
sg4
I5
sa(dp2159
g2
VSome sort of research lab. We've come across a few of them. These consoles generally access the central computer systems, so Jinto could've caused what we thought were malfunctions from here. Look, I need to know everything you touched.
p2160
sg4
I39
sa(dp2161
g2
V(into radio) We didn't touch anything. It could be the entity causing random malfunctions. The proximity to that large an energy disturbance could cause the Ancient technology to-to go haywire.
p2162
sg4
I30
sa(dp2163
g2
V(over radio) Pull open the console on the wall.
p2164
sg4
I9
sa(dp2165
g2
V(into radio) I'm not sure. What do you see?
p2166
sg4
I9
sa(dp2167
g2
V(into radio) Take out the middle one. Move the top one down.
p2168
sg4
I12
sa(dp2169
g2
V(into radio) Okay, use the middle one to bridge the two others.
p2170
sg4
I12
sa(dp2171
g2
V(into radio, weakly) Not exactly.
p2172
sg4
I5
sa(dp2173
g2
VReally?
p2174
sg4
I1
sa(dp2175
g2
V(piqued) Oh, how nice for you all.
p2176
sg4
I7
sa(dp2177
g2
VWell, believe it or not, Jinto didn't, uh, touch anything of any consequence, other than that.
p2178
sg4
I16
sa(dp2179
g2
VIt must have its own power source, like the jumpers.
p2180
sg4
I10
sa(dp2181
g2
VWell, it's some sort of containment vessel for the energy creature.
p2182
sg4
I11
sa(dp2183
g2
VWell, it seems that way.
p2184
sg4
I5
sa(dp2185
g2
VAs I suggested, the entity's what's been causing most of our technical problems. Now, it was captured for observation. The Ancients were researching Ascension.
p2186
sg4
I24
sa(dp2187
g2
VWell, at some point during their evolution, the Ancients reached an advanced stage of being where they were able to rid themselves of their physical bodies and rise to a higher plain of existence, one in which they live as pure energy. We\u2014I know it sounds ridiculous, but this is the first indication there may have been evolutionary intervention to get there.
p2188
sg4
I62
sa(dp2189
g2
VWell, I haven't read all the notes, but what I do know is that the entity is energy. It feeds on energy. Ford's lucky. I mean, the more it feeds, the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more charged it becomes and the more deadly it will be.
p2190
sg4
I50
sa(dp2191
g2
VWell, according to the research, it\u2026it is sentient, but if you're thinking about trying to talk to it, you'd have more luck with a great white shark. This thing is going to suck the power out of our generators, and then it will kill us all.
p2192
sg4
I46
sa(dp2193
g2
VThe entity has been trapped in here since before the Ancients abandoned the city.
p2194
sg4
I14
sa(dp2195
g2
VAnd hungry. The point is\u2026this device was designed to attract it, capture it, and hold it for observation. There's still a chance we might be able to get it back inside. I'm just going to need a little more time to figure out how.
p2196
sg4
I44
sa(dp2197
g2
VI don't know, but this is much simpler than I thought. It's kind of like a mousetrap. This button here causes the device to emit an energy signature that attracts the creature. This one shuts it in. Now, the only downside is it looks like, uh, someone's actually going to have to be here to press the buttons.
p2198
sg4
I58
sa(dp2199
g2
VOkay.
p2200
sg4
I1
sa(dp2201
g2
V(pleased) Hmm!
p2202
sg4
I2
sa(dp2203
g2
VWhat do you mean? Had a feeling about what? You think I wanted it to come off just now? You think I'm scared? I'm not scared. I'll stay. I'll do this.
p2204
sg4
I31
sa(dp2205
g2
VIt\u2014it's just not working anymore.
p2206
sg4
I5
sa(dp2207
g2
VLook\u2026see, it doesn't work on you either.
p2208
sg4
I7
sa(dp2209
g2
V(frustrated) Well, it is just a coincidence that it happened to stop working now. God, I need a drink.
p2210
sg4
I19
sa(dp2211
g2
VAre we ready?
p2212
sg4
I3
sa(dp2213
g2
VAnd you're doing it because?
p2214
sg4
I5
sa(dp2215
g2
VHmm.
p2216
sg4
I1
sa(dp2217
g2
V(over radio) Size doesn't matter.
p2218
sg4
I5
sa(dp2219
g2
V(into radio) It'll fit. The device traps the creature in subspace. You just need to make sure it gets all the way inside the containment vessel.
p2220
sg4
I26
sa(dp2221
g2
VYou can't do that.
p2222
sg4
I4
sa(dp2223
g2
VBecause you turned the power back on.
p2224
sg4
I7
sa(dp2225
g2
VIt doesn't think on that level. It thinks about eating. That's it.
p2226
sg4
I12
sa(dp2227
g2
VWell, I don't see how.
p2228
sg4
I5
sa(dp2229
g2
VThis is a bad idea.
p2230
sg4
I5
sa(dp2231
g2
VWell, it's worth saying again.
p2232
sg4
I5
sa(dp2233
g2
VAn open Stargate is a huge power source. This thing is smart. It knew enough not to get trapped in the Ancient containment vessel again. What makes you think it's going to follow a naquadah generator into the wormhole?
p2234
sg4
I39
sa(dp2235
g2
VGood luck.
p2236
sg4
I2
sa(dp2237
g2
VIt's not goin' anywhere.
p2238
sg4
I4
sa(dp2239
g2
V(angry) It could be feeding off the generator, off the Stargate. I mean, this is a disaster.
p2240
sg4
I17
sa(dp2241
g2
VI can't.
p2242
sg4
I2
sa(dp2243
g2
VWhat happened?
p2244
sg4
I2
sa(dp2245
g2
VI did?
p2246
sg4
I2
sa(dp2247
g2
VWell, thanks for not saying the other thing.
p2248
sg4

sa(dp2249
g2
V(caustic, but weak) Thank you. Take your time. Man down.
p2250
sg4
I10
sa(dp2251
g2
VYes, yes! Hurry up and get us back!
p2252
sg4
I8
sa(dp2253
g2
V(calling forward) As soon as we establish a connection, radio back that we've got a medical emergency.
p2254
sg4
I17
sa(dp2255
g2
VThere's an emergency first aid kit behind the pilot's seat. Get it. Major, everything we try to do to remove it just makes the pain worse. Now try and be still.
p2256
sg4
I31
sa(dp2257
g2
VWhat am I expecting to find in here that's going to get rid of that thing?
p2258
sg4
I16
sa(dp2259
g2
VI don't think Tylenol's going to do it. He needs a doctor. How much longer?
p2260
sg4
I15
sa(dp2261
g2
VOh, no.
p2262
sg4
I2
sa(dp2263
g2
VThe drive pod\u2026the wing things that stick out when we're flying must've failed to retract. That's the only thing it can be, It's that, or the stargate shrank, which I highly doubt. This is a\u2014a big problem.
p2264
sg4
I37
sa(dp2265

VI don't know if there's anything we can do. I mean, this is a very, very big problem.
p2266

VAnd we have less than thirty-eight minutes.
p2294
sg4
I7
sa(dp2295
g2
V(over radio) Because that's the maximum amount of time a stargate can remain open in non-relativistic conditions. It's one of the more immutable laws of wormhole physics and, oh, my, look at the time. It's now more like thirty-five minutes. Are we all caught up?

V(into radio) Help.
p2298

V(into radio) We'll call you. Thank you.
p2304
sg4
I7
sa(dp2305

VWe're going with the assumption it was one or both of the drive pods. I don't know whether it was mechanical failure or\u2014
p2306
sg4
I23
sa(dp2307

VThere's no way of knowing really, but, uh, if you know of some way of manually retracting the mechanism\u2014
p2308

VThe cockpit is regrettably demolecularized at the moment, but how about somewhere back here?
p2310
sg4
I14
sa(dp2311

VSo that when the stargate shuts down and the forward section is severed, we're not directly exposed to space.
p2322
sg4
I19
sa(dp2323

VI'm sorry, Major. I'm\u2014 I react to certain doom a certain way. It's a bad habit, and\u2026 maybe there's a way to manually retract the mechanism.

sg4
I3
sa(dp2335
g2
VReally?
p2336
sg4
I1
sa(dp2337

V(over radio) I suppose the Wraith had to evolve from something. It's probably some sort of, uh, prehistoric cousin.

VZelenka. Why can I never remember that name?

V(into radio) Thank you. Now we're getting somewhere.
p2342
sg4
I8
sa(dp2343

VZelenka's identified the control pathways to the engine pod, which means that's increasing my chances of fixing this from one in a million to one in a thousand but, uh\u2026 it's something. Elizabeth?

sg4
I33
sa(dp2345

VI think that was a metaphor. But it doesn't matter. Just try everything.
p2354

p2368

g2
V(into radio) I think I did it.
p2386

sa(dp2387
g2
VElizabeth, I think the engine pod's retracting.
p2388
sg4
I7
sa(dp2389
g2
V(realizing) It's inertia. The drive shut down before we went through the stargate. We've shed all our forward momentum.
p2390
sg4
I19
sa(dp2391
g2
VYou're wasting your time. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
p2392

VThat could do it, but the only mechanism to blow the hatch is back here.

I11
sa(dp2431
g2
VI mean, we are stranded with limited resources in another galaxy. I mean, come on, the nearest Bob's Big Boy is 300 million light years away. We have to make do. If that means you have to eat my favorite food two days in a row, so be it.
p2432

VDefine "huge."
p2448
sg4

VThat would make it approximately the size of, uh\u2026 I have no idea, but it sounds huge.
p2450
sg4
I17

VHe's right. If the land's arable, it could solve a lot of our food production problems.
p2452

p2468

p2474
sg4

sa(dp2475

VMajor, I need you to see something.
p2476

sa(dp2481
g2
VThe thing is\u2026he was right.
p2482
sg4
I5
sa(dp2483
g2
VI know. I was as surprised as you are. Look at this. It's her locket. It's a transmitter. It's been broadcasting a continuous signal. I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't been looking for it specifically.
p2484
sg4
I37
sa(dp2485
g2
V(nonplussed) What?
p2486
sg4
I2
sa(dp2487
g2
VThe locket isn't powerful enough to send a signal very far, certainly not through subspace. Now, my guess is that there are probably relay devices on certain planets that pick up the transmission and then alert the nearest hive ship. Those were the planets where we were attacked.
p2488
sg4
I48
sa(dp2489
g2
VIt was probably dormant until Major Sheppard picked it up, activating it.
p2490
sg4
I12
sa(dp2491
g2
VDidn't I just say it was dormant?
p2492
sg4
I7
sa(dp2493
g2
VYou're not listening. I said Major Sheppard activated it.
p2494
sg4
I9
sa(dp2495
g2
VThey would have no special interest in tracking her. Now, Major Sheppard, on the other hand\u2026
p2496
sg4
I16
sa(dp2497
g2
VExactly. Now, at one point, the Wraiths and the Ancients were at war. The Wraiths created a transmission device to detect Ancients.
p2498
sg4
I22
sa(dp2499
g2
VHow could I possibly know that? What am I, Answer Man? The point is\u2014

VNo, I'm a part of this team. I'm doing this.
p2502

VOh, really? I thought you said, "Rodney, you don't have to do this."
p2504
sg4
I13
sa(dp2505

VDamn right I'm doing this, despite the fact that feeling hasn't completely returned to my extremities.
p2506
sg4
I16
sa(dp2507
g2
VThe last planet we visited was inaccessible by ship, and the, uh, ruins around the Stargate should force the Wraith to come through on foot.

p2512

VI've read a lot of reports from SG teams on missions like this one. Specifically, the mission reports of Colonel Samantha Carter. She and I worked together to avert global catastrophe a few years back. She and I\u2026ay-yi-yi. Anyways, what was I saying?
p2514
sg4
I43
sa(dp2515
g2
VRight, well, apparently, there's remarkable similarities between worlds that support life. It makes sense, really. For example, the color of the sky is just a product\u2014
p2516

I26
sa(dp2517
g2
VWhat was that?
p2518
sg4
I3
sa(dp2519

VI'm getting seriously conflicted readings. It looks like some sort of powerful energy field about two thousand yards over there.
p2520

VCheck this out.
p2560
sg4
I3
sa(dp2561

p2562
sg4
I19
sa(dp2563

VIt's worth a shot. If we can shut down the field, we won't have to walk back to the gate.

g2
VWhat?
p2580
sg4
I1
sa(dp2581
g2
VOf course it's not the same. Veal is delicious. The Wraith don't come by anymore, because when their darts fly close to the villages, the electromagnetic field takes them out, much like what happened to our Puddle Jumper.
p2582
sg4
I38
sa(dp2583
g2
VI'm sorry, perhaps I'm not being clear. Nothing works here, not their stunners, their darts\u2026even their shields wouldn't function correctly. I mean, why would they risk their advantage when there's a smorgasbord through some other stargate?
p2584
sg4
I36

sa(dp2599
g2
VIt's grown-up stuff.
p2600
sg4
I3
sa(dp2601
g2
VSomeone who's older than you are.
p2602
sg4
I6
sa(dp2603
g2
VNice try, but you're not a grown-up.
p2604
sg4
I7
sa(dp2605
g2
VI don't need you to tell me what I just said, okay?
p2606
sg4
I12
sa(dp2607
g2
VFord, a little help here.
p2608
sg4
I5
sa(dp2609
g2
VLet's see how long we can be quiet. Who could be quiet the longest, huh?
p2610
sg4
I15
sa(dp2611
g2
VThat's not quiet, that's talking.
p2612
sg4
I5
sa(dp2613
g2
VHey, hey, coming through. Thank you.
p2614
sg4
I6
sa(dp2615
g2
VIt's a compass.
p2616
sg4
I3
sa(dp2617
g2
VUsed for determining direction on Earth. I'm using it to\u2014
p2618
sg4
I10
sa(dp2619
g2
VListen, Cleo\u2014
p2620
sg4
I2
sa(dp2621
g2
VWhatever. Aren't you supposed to be observing? Do you understand what that means, observing?
p2622
sg4
I14
sa(dp2623
g2
VIt means you're supposed to watch. You're supposed to stay out of my way and watch.
p2624
sg4
I16
sa(dp2625
g2
VBecause.
p2626
sg4
I1
sa(dp2627
g2
VBecause I say so.
p2628
sg4
I4
sa(dp2629
g2
V(over radio) Because I can't get any work done with you two buzzing around, asking stupid questions in your stupid little voices. Now sit down and shut up!
p2630
sg4
I28
sa(dp2631
g2
VOh, don't. Do\u2014don't.
p2632
sg4
I3
sa(dp2633
g2
VThank you for finally noticing.
p2634
sg4
I5
sa(dp2635
g2
VOkay, you want to go? You want to go, huh?
p2636
sg4
I10
sa(dp2637
g2
VLook, I have a purpose here, okay? You deal with them. Excuse me. Thank you.
p2638
sg4
I15
sa(dp2639
g2
VOh, yeah. Okay.
p2640
sg4
I3
sa(dp2641
g2
VHello, hello.
p2642
sg4
I2
sa(dp2643
g2
VMajor.
p2644
sg4
I1
sa(dp2645
g2
VWhich is how I'm able to speak with you, yes. Do you have a second?
p2646
sg4
I15
sa(dp2647
g2
VI found the field generator. And obviously, the off switch. Better than that\u2014-the device is powered by a zero-point module. It's definitely possible the EM field's been on-line for centuries. As far as I know, only a ZPM is capable of powering it that long. I've shut it down. Everything's working now.
p2648
sg4
I52
sa(dp2649
g2
VJust temporarily. I need to get the ZPM back to Atlantis, see if it's worth taking.
p2650
sg4
I16
sa(dp2651
g2
VThere's no evidence that the Wraith have been here in years. Besides, if this is a fully functioning ZPM, we can bring them all back to Atlantis. How hard could that be?
p2652
sg4
I32
sa(dp2653
g2
VExactly. I need to get it back to a lab.
p2654
sg4
I10
sa(dp2655
g2
VWell, I've had the gene inoculation, and you've already given me a flying lesson.
p2656
sg4
I14
sa(dp2657
g2
VListen, I'm not going to be dog fighting Wraith darts. Ford and I can handle it.
p2658
sg4
I16
sa(dp2659
g2
VRight.
p2660
sg4
I1
sa(dp2661
g2
VWhy?
p2662
sg4
I1
sa(dp2663
g2
VYep.
p2664
sg4
I1
sa(dp2665
g2
VIt wouldn't be stealing so much as\u2026look, if it's any good to us, we can bring them here.
p2666
sg4
I18
sa(dp2667
g2
VWell, I hardly doubt there'll be more than a few hundred.
p2668
sg4
I11
sa(dp2669
g2
VThis is a big, empty city, and we have the mainland now.
p2670
sg4
I12
sa(dp2671
g2
VIf they have a ZPM, yes, we can.
p2672
sg4
I8
sa(dp2673
g2
VElizabeth, they live in trees. Atlantis would be a big step-up for them. Plus, they could stop killing themselves for no good reason.
p2674
sg4
I23
sa(dp2675
g2
VYes, they are. The EM shield is what's keeping the Wraith away, not the sacrificing.
p2676
sg4
I15
sa(dp2677
g2
VMore or less.
p2678
sg4
I3
sa(dp2679
g2
VHuh. Well\u2026maybe.
p2680
sg4
I2
sa(dp2681
g2
VDr. Weir\u2026 The bad news is it looks like the device harnesses M7G-677's unique electromagnetic field. It probably wouldn't work for us.
p2682
sg4
I22
sa(dp2683
g2
VUh, not much point to that, either. The ZPM is almost depleted.
p2684
sg4
I12
sa(dp2685
g2
VI wouldn't say that. It's enough to give us\u2026oh, the shield at full power for a few hours, which would be handy if the Wraith ever attack. Now, it could continue doing what it was doing for quite some time, but, uh\u2014
p2686
sg4
I42
sa(dp2687
g2
VProbably.
p2688
sg4
I1
sa(dp2689
g2
VFine. There's another thing.
p2690
sg4
I4
sa(dp2691
g2
VI think I have a theory about the suicide pact.
p2692
sg4
I10
sa(dp2693
g2
VI'm not sure how much power this thing had to start with, but whoever built the EM device knew it wouldn't be able to power a field large enough to cover the whole planet for very long.
p2694
sg4
I37
sa(dp2695
g2
VMore or less the area around the villages. But if the population got much larger than they are now, there's a chance the kids would move out of the field and may become susceptible to a Wraith attack.
p2696
sg4
I38
sa(dp2697
g2
VPopulation control.
p2698
sg4
I2
sa(dp2699
g2
VA little? I mean, the point is they believe if they die in fear and turmoil, they don't get to go to their version of heaven. Now, while this, at the very least, guarantees that they die in peace, it's\u2026Well, it's a religion, and a pretty ridiculous one at that.
p2700
sg4
I50
sa(dp2701
g2
VNo?
p2702
sg4
I1
sa(dp2703
g2
VNo.
p2704
sg4
I1
sa(dp2705
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard, it's McKay.
p2706
sg4
I5
sa(dp2707
g2
V(over radio) What does that mean?
p2708
sg4
I6
sa(dp2709
g2
V(over radio) That doesn't sound good.
p2710
sg4
I6
sa(dp2711
g2
V(over radio) Ford and I are back at the old city. I'm just going to put the ZPM back.
p2712
sg4
I19
sa(dp2713
g2
V(over radio) I've parked the jumper outside the EM field, so we should be able to leave as soon as I've finished.
p2714
sg4
I22
sa(dp2715
g2
VI'm coming!
p2716
sg4
I2
sa(dp2717
g2
V(puzzled) Well, that should be it.
p2718
sg4
I6
sa(dp2719
g2
VFar be it for me to cause a panic, but\u2014
p2720
sg4
I10
sa(dp2721
g2
VThere's the slightest possibility that in my haste, I may have broken it.
p2722
sg4
I13
sa(dp2723
g2
VI don't know what I did. These things are usually plug and play. This device must be using an older version of Windows.
p2724
sg4
I23
sa(dp2725
g2
VWhat I'm saying is there's a sequence to reinstalling the ZPM which I haven't gotten yet.
p2726
sg4
I16
sa(dp2727
g2
VWe.
p2728
sg4
I1
sa(dp2729
g2
VIt renders all electromagnetic-based technology inside the shield inert.
p2730
sg4
I9
sa(dp2731
g2
VThat's not entirely true, actually. The shield doesn't protect the whole planet. It doesn't have enough power. I believe the idea of the sacrifices was brought in so your society never left the confines of the shield. Look, the sacrifices play a part in your survival, but not for the reasons you believe.
p2732
sg4
I53
sa(dp2733
g2
VComing through, coming through. Excuse me.
p2734
sg4
I6
sa(dp2735
g2
V(going back in) All right. And again. Still in the way. Thank you.
p2736
sg4
I13
sa(dp2737
g2
VAll right.
p2738
sg4
I2
sa(dp2739
g2
VOh\u2026oh, you scared me.
p2740
sg4
I4
sa(dp2741
g2
VSorry.
p2742
sg4
I1
sa(dp2743
g2
VUh\u2026yes, yes, of course. What? Oh, you want some.
p2744
sg4
I9
sa(dp2745
g2
VOkay, you can have this\u2026 but you've got to promise to let me work, okay?
p2746
sg4
I15
sa(dp2747
g2
VAll right. Quietly.
p2748
sg4
I3
sa(dp2749
g2
VCome on.
p2750
sg4
I2
sa(dp2751
g2
VI can't do that. Listen\u2026I need to finish my work here. I've seen how the Wraith deal with other planets, and they don't care how old you are. I need to get this device turned on, and I am so close to figuring it out, so just give me one more shot. Look, both of you, go to your rooms! You're not buying this, are you?
p2752
sg4
I66
sa(dp2753
g2
VHey, psst! Come on, come on.
p2754
sg4
I6
sa(dp2755
g2
VNo.
p2756
sg4
I1
sa(dp2757
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa.
p2758
sg4
I3
sa(dp2759
g2
VOf course it works.
p2760
sg4
I4
sa(dp2761
g2
VHey, you guys okay? All right, head back to the woods. You're gonna be fine.
p2762
sg4
I15
sa(dp2763
g2
V(panting) Tryin' to catch my breath\u2026
p2764
sg4
I6
sa(dp2765
g2
VI've been able to boost the coverage by over 50% without much of a power increase, so that should be enough for a sizable population growth.
p2766
sg4
I26
sa(dp2767
g2
VThere's no way of knowing, no but there's a good chance you'll be a grandparent before it\u2026before it goes.
p2768
sg4
I19
sa(dp2769
g2
V(to children) See him there.
p2770
sg4
I5
sa(dp2771
g2
VThere you go.
p2772
sg4
I3
sa(dp2773
g2
VGeothermal energy.
p2774
sg4
I2
sa(dp2775
g2
VWhat, using this? Do you have any idea how complex geothermal energy is?
p2776
sg4
I13
sa(dp2777
g2
VI'm sure it'll work like a charm.
p2778
sg4
I7
sa(dp2779
g2
VSo you are expecting it to happen again.
p2780
sg4
I8
sa(dp2781
g2
V(looking sideways at Sheppard) Fifty years you say?
p2782
sg4
I8
sa(dp2783
g2
VYou haven't told him that we practically woke the Wraith from hibernation, have you?
p2784
sg4
I14
sa(dp2785
g2
VWe've been here two days.
p2786
sg4
I5
sa(dp2787
g2
VMajor, they're not expecting the Wraith for another 50 years. We have to let them know they could show up at any time now.
p2788
sg4
I24
sa(dp2789
g2
VReminds you of Area 51, doesn't it?
p2790
sg4
I7
sa(dp2791
g2
VTrue.
p2792
sg4
I1
sa(dp2793
g2
VI\u2019d say given their current level of technology, that could be an understatement. Just because they believe they're close to a breakthrough doesn't mean that they are.
p2794
sg4
I27
sa(dp2795
g2
VHence, Major Sheppard has generously offered our help to the Hoffans.
p2796
sg4
I11
sa(dp2797
g2
VYou're a generous man, Carson.
p2798
sg4
I5
sa(dp2799
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no. He just doesn't like going through the Stargate.
p2800
sg4
I13
sa(dp2801
g2
VCome on, how often do you get to travel to an alien planet?
p2802
sg4
I13
sa(dp2803
g2
VI'm Dr. McKay. Dr. Rodney McKay.
p2804
sg4
I6
sa(dp2805
g2
VHow long ago was that?
p2806
sg4
I5
sa(dp2807
g2
VIn case they destroy one. You guys are serious about this.
p2808
sg4
I11
sa(dp2809
g2
VHe's got a good point. The Hoffans are practically obsessed.
p2810
sg4
I10
sa(dp2811
g2
VWell, even if they do\u2026undo, it'd be good for us. I mean, given the choice, wouldn't you want to be immune?
p2812
sg4
I21
sa(dp2813
g2
VHe blinked? What does that mean?
p2814
sg4
I6
sa(dp2815
g2
VAnd he indicated this to you by blinking?
p2816
sg4
I8
sa(dp2817
g2
VNot that it hasn't been lovely.
p2818
sg4
I6
sa(dp2819
g2
VI know. It's getting desperate. We're almost out of coffee.
p2820
sg4
I10
sa(dp2821
g2
VI'm just making sure I get my fair share before it's all gone.
p2822
sg4
I13
sa(dp2823
g2
VMm.
p2824
sg4
I1
sa(dp2825
g2
VWell, if you know where the village is\u2014
p2826
sg4
I8
sa(dp2827
g2
VWhat is it you said they grow here, anyway?
p2828
sg4
I9
sa(dp2829
g2
VWhat, java?
p2830
sg4
I2
sa(dp2831
g2
V(to Sheppard) Maybe we should offer a sense of humor in trade.
p2832
sg4
I12
sa(dp2833
g2
V(laughing sarcastically) Oh, please, my side. You slay me.
p2834
sg4
I9
sa(dp2835
g2
VThey are capable of stopping bacterial infections entirely.
p2836
sg4
I8
sa(dp2837
g2
VIt can be quite loud.
p2838
sg4
I5
sa(dp2839
g2
VI should go back with the Major.
p2840
sg4
I7
sa(dp2841
g2
VYou have no idea which way to go, do you?
p2842
sg4
I10
sa(dp2843
g2
VTranslation, "I'm lost." They were very clear which route to take.
p2844
sg4
I11
sa(dp2845
g2
VYes, of course, because everything's a shortcut in Sheppard's world.
p2846
sg4
I10
sa(dp2847
g2
VOkay, there it is again.
p2848
sg4
I5
sa(dp2849
g2
VI'm picking up a strange reading from right over there.
p2850
sg4
I10
sa(dp2851
g2
VYou don't know what strange means?
p2852
sg4
I6
sa(dp2853
g2
VWeird, freakish, odd\u2014
p2854
sg4
I3
sa(dp2855
g2
VIt's radioactive readings in an Amish world. Your call. Look, we're lost anyway. What difference does it make?
p2856
sg4
I18
sa(dp2857
g2
VOh, now, that is definitely\u2014
p2858
sg4
I5
sa(dp2859
g2
VYeah, not that Amish, really.
p2860
sg4
I5
sa(dp2861
g2
VMaybe they don't even know it's here.
p2862
sg4
I7
sa(dp2863
g2
VReally? Of course we do.
p2864
sg4
I5
sa(dp2865
g2
V(sarcastically) Great.
p2866
sg4
I2
sa(dp2867
g2
VThe construction's architecturally advanced. I don't think the Genii could've made this.
p2868
sg4
I12
sa(dp2869
g2
VThis place is built like a bunker. It must be shielded for RF. The reading's stronger this way.
p2870
sg4
I18
sa(dp2871
g2
V(sarcastically) Palm readings.
p2872
sg4
I3
sa(dp2873
g2
VIt's neutron radiation. It's definitely a\u2026a powerful energy source.
p2874
sg4
I9
sa(dp2875
g2
VI really think we should-we should get out of here.
p2876
sg4
I10
sa(dp2877
g2
VMaybe they exist as two separate cultures.
p2878
sg4
I7
sa(dp2879
g2
VYou know if people could just learn to keep their secret underground hatches locked\u2026
p2880
sg4
I14
sa(dp2881
g2
VOh. Can we be careful with that? It's just it's rather fragile, and if it, uh\u2026
p2882
sg4
I16
sa(dp2883
g2
VWe say, "What giant, underground bunker?"
p2884
sg4
I6
sa(dp2885
g2
VAre you kidding? "Weapons 'R' Us." We\u2014
p2886
sg4
I7
sa(dp2887
g2
VUh, did I mention that I know almost everything about almost everything?
p2888
sg4
I12
sa(dp2889
g2
VYou think you can do that with an atomic bomb?
p2890
sg4
I10
sa(dp2891
g2
VWell, radioactive readings, your fascination with our C-4\u2026
p2892
sg4
I8
sa(dp2893
g2
VIt just came to me when he said, "One day, all that will change." I assume you're hoping our C-4 will solve your super-criticality problem.
p2894
sg4
I25
sa(dp2895
g2
VIt might. Depends on your design. There's a host of other considerations.
p2896
sg4
I12
sa(dp2897
g2
VMajor, most of my high school chess team could design an A-bomb. The actual hard part is having sufficient fissionable materials of appropriate grade.
p2898
sg4
I24
sa(dp2899
g2
VOh, that thing you so carelessly threw on the table? Can I, uh take that along?
p2900
sg4
I16
sa(dp2901
g2
VYou do realize that long-term exposure to these levels of radiation is extremely dangerous.
p2902
sg4
I14
sa(dp2903
g2
VWell, they're wrong.
p2904
sg4
I3
sa(dp2905
g2
VIt would take days or weeks at these levels of radiation, but I assume the Genii spend days or weeks down here.
p2906
sg4
I22
sa(dp2907
g2
V(to Sheppard) Their entire, short lives. We'll be fine, just as long as you weren't planning on having children.
p2908
sg4
I19
sa(dp2909
g2
VWell, you're on the right track. We're about sixty years ahead of you. That is, if you survive. This shielding is woefully inadequate. Now, uranium how much do you have?
p2910
sg4
I30
sa(dp2911
g2
VYeah, but it's nowhere near weapons grade.
p2912
sg4
I7
sa(dp2913
g2
VDiffusion\u2014you need to separate the 235 from the 238. When you remove the barrier between two substances, the slight difference in their mass causes them to separate at different rates.
p2914
sg4
I30
sa(dp2915
g2
VWell, of course. I just\u2014
p2916
sg4
I5
sa(dp2917
g2
V(to Ford) You don't think there's lemon in this, do you?
p2918
sg4
I11
sa(dp2919
g2
VHave you seen someone in anaphylactic shock?
p2920
sg4
I7
sa(dp2921
g2
VWell, there's two different approaches, actually\u2014implosion and a gun-type bomb. Both were designed to create a supercritical mass, obviously.
p2922
sg4
I19
sa(dp2923
g2
VEither way you go, you need an amount of refined 235 roughly equivalent to the size of my fist\u2026or his fist, actually.
p2924
sg4
I22
sa(dp2925
g2
VI built an atomic bomb for my grade six science fair exhibit.
p2926
sg4
I12
sa(dp2927
g2
VIt wasn't a working model. Still, I was questioned for six hours by the CIA, who believed I was part of a secret pre-teen organization. Actually, it led to my first job\u2014
p2928
sg4
I32
sa(dp2929
g2
VIt's the flash memory of a jump drive.
p2930

VThe Wraith tend to self-destruct. It's probably pretty rare to get a hold of something like this. Have you been able to access any other data?
p2936
sg4
I26
sa(dp2937
g2
VWell, how does getting access to a Wraith ship's computer help you?
p2938
sg4
I12
sa(dp2939
g2
VThe spherical encasement directs the explosive forces inward, and the resulting implosion creates extreme compression. Subcritical mass becomes supercritical.
p2940
sg4
I19
sa(dp2941
g2
VI know, and can you believe I didn't even win the science fair? So, the practical adaptation of available equipment and resources will be the real challenge.
p2942
sg4
I27
sa(dp2943
g2
VRight.
p2944
sg4
I1
sa(dp2945
g2
V(to himself) I'm a dead man.
p2946
sg4
I6
sa(dp2947

VOh, god.
p2948
sg4
I2
sa(dp2949

VSo find another way. Okay.
p2950
sg4
I5
sa(dp2951

VCan I get some light here?
p2952

VBingo.
p2960
sg4
I1
sa(dp2961
g2
VWe've got it.
p2962
sg4
I3
sa(dp2963
g2
VGenerous of you.
p2964
sg4
I3
sa(dp2965
g2
VHow was I to know the only structures on this planet would be in the immediate area around the Stargate?
p2966
sg4
I20
sa(dp2967
g2
VWait. The energy readings here are exactly the same as they were a mile away.
p2968
sg4
I15
sa(dp2969
g2
VI really think we should stay for a while.
p2970
sg4
I9
sa(dp2971
g2
VI do. I'm incredibly uncomfortable, but these energy readings are amazing. It's like it's coming from all around us.
p2972
sg4
I19
sa(dp2973
g2
VNot yet.
p2974
sg4
I2
sa(dp2975
g2
V(defensively) Not yet.
p2976
sg4
I3
sa(dp2977
g2
VWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There is such a thing as pure science. Not everything has to be immediately useful.
p2978
sg4
I20
sa(dp2979
g2
VIt's not technically fog. There's no actual water vapor in the atmosphere. I mean, you know, for that matter, I don't think we need to wear the hazmat gear.
p2980
sg4
I29
sa(dp2981
g2
VWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You wanted useful?
p2982
sg4
I10
sa(dp2983
g2
VWhen the wormhole connected, there was a wild fluctuation in the energy field. I mean, if I'm reading these numbers right, it looks like the gate is actually drawing power from the atmosphere.
p2984
sg4
I33
sa(dp2985
g2
VSo? To the best of my knowledge, this field goes on for miles. I mean, for all we know, it envelops the entire planet. We're talking about a lot of energy here.
p2986
sg4
I32
sa(dp2987
g2
VWell, in terms of joules or ergs?
p2988
sg4
I7
sa(dp2989
g2
VWell, lots and lots. Enough to open a wormhole back to Earth.
p2990
sg4
I12
sa(dp2991
g2
VIt is, but that's because it's the only one with an additional control crystal that allows the eighth chevron to lock.
p2992
sg4
I21
sa(dp2993
g2
VIt doesn't matter. As long as we have the control crystal, I can make the other gate work.
p2994
sg4
I18
sa(dp2995
g2
VYes.
p2996
sg4
I1
sa(dp2997
g2
VI'll be fine.
p2998
sg4
I3
sa(dp2999
g2
VI know what I'm doing. Besides, the control crystal is useless without enough power.
p3000
sg4
I14
sa(dp3001
g2
VI believe it is being generated somehow in the atmosphere itself.
p3002
sg4
I11
sa(dp3003
g2
VYes.
p3004
sg4
I1
sa(dp3005
g2
VWhatever it is.
p3006
sg4
I3
sa(dp3007
g2
V(becoming annoyed) I don't yet, but the fog, or the mist, or whatever you want to call it, is the only thing around for miles, and the energy readings were constant.
p3008
sg4
I31
sa(dp3009
g2
VI'm sure someone will volunteer.
p3010
sg4
I5
sa(dp3011
g2
VBelieve it or not, I would only go if I knew there was a good chance I could come back. At least, we can send a message to Stargate Command. Let them know that we're okay.
p3012
sg4
I36
sa(dp3013
g2
VAll right. That's it.
p3014
sg4
I4
sa(dp3015
g2
VThe Atlantis' DHD is unique. It's not like there'll be an empty slot waiting for us to plug it in.
p3016
sg4
I20
sa(dp3017
g2
VMeaning that there may be some disassembly required.
p3018
sg4
I8
sa(dp3019
g2
VI'll put it back together again.
p3020
sg4
I6
sa(dp3021
g2
VOnly if I screw up, which is extremely unlikely.
p3022
sg4
I9
sa(dp3023
g2
VWhat?
p3024
sg4
I1
sa(dp3025
g2
VBut you would do that, right?
p3026
sg4
I6
sa(dp3027
g2
VWell, it won't be necessary. However I may require some assistance.
p3028
sg4
I11
sa(dp3029
g2
VAtlantis, this is McKay.
p3030
sg4
I4
sa(dp3031
g2
VWe're ready to begin work on the DHD.
p3032
sg4
I8
sa(dp3033
g2
VPositive. The next time you hear from us we'll be delivering the good news.
p3034
sg4
I14
sa(dp3035
g2
VWe'll be back in time for supper.
p3036
sg4
I7
sa(dp3037
g2
V(to Ford) All right. Let's get started.
p3038
sg4
I7
sa(dp3039
g2
VI don't think it matters what I would want.
p3040
sg4
I9
sa(dp3041
g2
VBecause Atlantis can't afford to lose me. I'm their foremost expert in gate theory, wormhole physics and a myriad of other sciences too numerous to mention yet too important to ignore.
p3042
sg4
I31
sa(dp3043
g2
V(ignoring Ford) On the other hand, if anyone's going it should be someone that commands the respect of the SGC and yet has the patience, knowledge, and determination to bring them up to speed and find a way to bring the cavalry back here.
p3044
sg4
I44
sa(dp3045
g2
VGranted, it would create a void if I were to go, but you can all take comfort in the knowledge that I'll be on the other side, spearheading the effort to return with reinforcements, fresh supplies, and Big Macs for all.
p3046
sg4
I41
sa(dp3047
g2
VYeah, good.
p3048
sg4
I2
sa(dp3049
g2
V(over radio) Elizabeth. I'm done. The component's installed in the DHD, and as you can see\u2014
p3050
sg4
I16
sa(dp3051
g2
VOh, same as before. All indications are that the gate's drawing power from the atmosphere, and there's enough for an eight-chevron lock.
p3052
sg4
I22
sa(dp3053
g2
VRight.
p3054
sg4
I1
sa(dp3055
g2
VSo are we, uh, ready?
p3056
sg4
I5
sa(dp3057
g2
VWell, this is sort of a big moment, and I thought we haven't been in contact for some time. I just figured we\u2014
p3058
sg4
I23
sa(dp3059
g2
VPlease work.
p3060
sg4
I2
sa(dp3061
g2
VWell\u2026 who's going?
p3062
sg4
I3
sa(dp3063
g2
VSo we're just going to turn tail and run?
p3064
sg4
I9
sa(dp3065
g2
VShe's right, General. They feed on human life forms, and now they know there's a smorgasbord waiting for them here.
p3066
sg4
I20
sa(dp3067
g2
VHmm, must've been a power failure or something. Anyways\u2026
p3068
sg4
I9
sa(dp3069
g2
V(awkwardly) Hi.
p3070
sg4
I2
sa(dp3071
g2
VHang on!
p3072
sg4
I2
sa(dp3073
g2
VOh, hey. Just the middle of a power nap, and uh, I'm not wearing any pants. I didn't even think you knew where I lived.
p3074
sg4
I25
sa(dp3075
g2
VOh, right. Oh, look, I can't, um\u2026really, um\u2026 I have a date with the girl in 302. She's been taking care of the cat for the whole time I was away, and, apparently she misses me\u2026
p3076
sg4
I36
sa(dp3077
g2
VI know, I'm trying to pawn off my cat off on a neighbor, and I end up with\u2026 What?
p3078
sg4
I19
sa(dp3079
g2
VI was going to come home, get some rest, then come back refreshed and ready to work on a solution. But an hour ago, it hit me, like Archimedes in the bathtub\u2014Eureka! Except I wasn't in a bathtub. I was on the couch watching a very strange Outer Limits episode\u2014
p3080
sg4
I50
sa(dp3081
g2
VForget Prometheus. I have figured out how to establish a wormhole connection back to the Pegasus galaxy, but I'm going to need the ZPM.
p3082
sg4
I24
sa(dp3083
g2
VActually, that's not entirely true. The last time we used it, the ZPM had to establish and maintain a wormhole back to Atlantis. This time around, all we need for it to do is to have enough energy to establish the briefest of connections\u2014by my calculations, approximately, what, 3.5 microseconds.
p3084
sg4
I50
sa(dp3085
g2
VGeneral, when we first set foot on M5S-224, before the wormhole shut down, I picked up fluctuations in the energy field. Now, at the time, I just assumed that was an effect of the gate's residual energy signature. But having given it some thought, I realized that can't account for such sizable variances, which leaves only one possible explanation. The gate must have been energized on our arrival, meaning it doesn't just draw power on outgoing wormholes, but on incoming wormholes as well. All we have to do is make a connection. 3.5 microseconds, that's the minimal amount of time it requires to confirm a lock before the gate automatically kicks in, drawing power from the atmosphere to maintain the wormhole.
p3086
sg4
I121
sa(dp3087
g2
VThink of it like making a long-distance call to someone you know is going to accept the charges. All you have to do is dial.
p3088
sg4
I25
sa(dp3089
g2
VWell, you're not going to lose anything by letting me try, are you? All I want to do is run a couple of tests.
p3090
sg4
I24
sa(dp3091
g2
VThank you.
p3092
sg4
I2
sa(dp3093
g2
VIf there's one thing I can't abide, it's sloppy work. If your people won't double-check their results, then there's no point in keeping them on the team.
p3094
sg4
I27
sa(dp3095
g2
VYes, Lieutenant.
p3096
sg4
I2
sa(dp3097
g2
VCongratulations.
p3098
sg4
I1
sa(dp3099
g2
VLieutenant, do you know something that I don't? Because the last time I checked, the Prometheus was critically damaged, and the only ZPM in our possession didn't have the power to run a car stereo.
p3100
sg4
I35
sa(dp3101
g2
V(unsympathetic) There is no other way, Lieutenant. You're just going to have to deal with it.
p3102
sg4
I16
sa(dp3103
g2
VYou people have those test results for me yet?
p3104
sg4
I9
sa(dp3105
g2
VWhat are you talking about? Let me see what you've got.
p3106
sg4
I11
sa(dp3107
g2
VWait a minute. What is this, some kind of a joke?
p3108
sg4
I11
sa(dp3109
g2
VThese don't even make any sense.
p3110
sg4
I6
sa(dp3111
g2
VWell, you wouldn't know that from this, would you? This might as well say, "Bing, tiddle, tiddle, bong." It's complete gibberish. Look, get out of here. I'll do it. Go.
p3112
sg4
I30
sa(dp3113
g2
VYou've got to be kidding me.
p3114
sg4
I6
sa(dp3115
g2
VWhat is this?
p3116
sg4
I3
sa(dp3117
g2
VElizabeth.
p3118
sg4
I1
sa(dp3119
g2
VCan it wait?
p3120
sg4
I3
sa(dp3121
g2
VI've run a diagnostic on the ZPM. These are the results I keep getting back.
p3122
sg4
I15
sa(dp3123
g2
VWell, neither is anyone else around here, apparently, otherwise they would have noticed that the laws of physics seem to have flown out the window.
p3124
sg4
I25
sa(dp3125
g2
VI checked. It's fine.
p3126
sg4
I4
sa(dp3127
g2
VWhat?
p3128
sg4
I1
sa(dp3129
g2
VOh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
p3130
sg4
I7
sa(dp3131
g2
VInteresting. Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.
p3132
sg4
I10
sa(dp3133
g2
VElizabeth, how did you expect them to react when you told them about the Wraith?
p3134
sg4
I15
sa(dp3135
g2
VOh, now you're just being paranoid. Why don\u2019t you go home, spend some time with Simon.
p3136
sg4
I16
sa(dp3137
g2
VYes. He's important to you, isn't he?
p3138
sg4
I7
sa(dp3139
g2
VWell, how else would I have known?
p3140
sg4
I7
sa(dp3141
g2
VLet me see if I can make you understand, okay? These results don't just say the ZPM won't work. They say this reality isn't governed by any natural laws. It's like looking through a microscope at a cell culture and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters! It\u2019s impossible.
p3142
sg4
I47
sa(dp3143
g2
VNo, no, what I need to do now is get very agitated, because what I'm realizing is all of this is a lie. This\u2026and this\u2026and this!
p3144
sg4
I26
sa(dp3145
g2
VNow, do you see what I mean?
p3146
sg4
I7
sa(dp3147
g2
VElizabeth, you shouldn't take it personally. I mean, think of it like a blessing. You have a life. You can get back to it now.
p3148
sg4
I25
sa(dp3149
g2
V(smiling falsely) Who am I? What do you mean?
p3150
sg4
I9
sa(dp3151
g2
VHe did?
p3152
sg4
I2
sa(dp3153
g2
VSo the energy readings we picked up\u2014they were life signs. You were in the mist.
p3154
sg4
I15
sa(dp3155
g2
VSo none of this is real? The cute brunette. Of course, I should've known. I mean, how do you go from "You're a pig, but I like your cat" to "I missed you"?
p3156
sg4
I33
sa(dp3157
g2
VDead people. What were you doing?
p3158
sg4
I6
sa(dp3159
g2
VWhoa, wait. I just realized something. You're saying that our unconscious bodies are still on the planet.
p3160
sg4
I17
sa(dp3161
g2
VYeah, well, so we need food. We need water. I mean, we need food.
p3162
sg4
I14
sa(dp3163
g2
VI don't mean to sound negative, because that would be, you know, so not me\u2026 But, uh, how do we know this isn't a double fake-out? I mean, how do we know that this is\u2014
p3164
sg4
I35
sa(dp3165
g2
VI'm starving. He's got to be right.
p3166
sg4
I7
sa(dp3167

VI need to get the control crystal out of the DHD. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

VAh, you mean Atlantis.
p3170
sg4

V(sadly) Yeah. He did it.
p3176
sg4

V(smiling as he takes the ZPM from the box) What say we.
p3186

p3192
sg4
I26
sa(dp3193
g2
VOkay, I mean, the ZPM. You need to protect the ZPM at all costs\u2026 and me. (to Weir) Am I wrong?
p3194

sa(dp3195
g2
VThat's where we have to go.
p3196

sg4
I3
sa(dp3211

p3218
sg4

sa(dp3219

VThe Wraith's faster-than-light travel is not as efficient as the Asgard hyperdrive aboard the Daedalus.(indicating the display on the monitor showing the hives' progress)Not only are they slower, they need to travel in a series of jumps. So, if my calculations are correct, they'll make one last stop here, fifty light years away, before they make the final jump to Atlantis.

VOh, let me see. We've got slow death, quick death, painful death, cold, lonely death\u2026

VIf they'd stop firing at it, it'd last almost indefinitely but with this kind of\u2026

VIt's almost pretty, isn't it?
p3264
sg4
I5
sa(dp3265
g2
VWell, now we know how the Ancients must have felt.
p3266
sg4
I10
sa(dp3267
g2
VYes, he said that.
p3268
sg4
I4
sa(dp3269
g2
VExactly what?
p3270
sg4
I2
sa(dp3271
g2
V(clicking his fingers excitedly) We cloak it.
p3272
sg4
I7
sa(dp3273
g2
VI wouldn't say "simply", but, yes. By interfacing a Jumper's stealth mode generator with the city shield, we should be able to render the city invisible.
p3274
sg4
I26
sa(dp3275
g2
V(wagging his finger and smiling smugly) Which is why we fake a self-destruct. Have the Daedalus beam a nuke right above the city shield and then detonate it. While their sensors are blinded, we cloak the city. When the smoke clears\u2026
p3276
sg4
I41
sa(dp3277
g2
VI should be able to calculate with reasonable accuracy how long to wait before we switch over to cloak.
p3278
sg4
I19
sa(dp3279
g2
VThat's coplanar emulation. That's the easy part.
p3280
sg4
I7
sa(dp3281
g2
VThe cloak, for all intents and purposes, will replace the shield, which means that we'll be completely unprotected once the cloak's activated.
p3282
sg4
I22
sa(dp3283
g2
VWell, yes.
p3284
sg4
I2
sa(dp3285

VOh, uh\u2026
p3286
sg4
I2
sa(dp3287

p3290

sa(dp3291
g2
VReady. (into radio) Radek.
p3292
sg4
I4
sa(dp3293
g2
VYeah, I think I'm ready.
p3294
sg4
I5
sa(dp3295

VI am definitely ready.

sa(dp3297
g2
VShut them down!

I3
sa(dp3299

VIf we switch to the cloak before the blast radius diminishes, we'll all be incinerated. Five seconds.

I17
sa(dp3301
g2
VWe're cloaked.
p3302
sg4
I2
sa(dp3303
g2
V(whispering) They're scanning for us.
p3304
sg4
I5
sa(dp3305
g2
V(whispering) I don't think they've detected us.
p3306
sg4
I7
sa(dp3307
g2
VI don't know. It just seems like the right thing to do.
p3308
sg4
I12
sa(dp3309
g2
V(angrily) I assume that's him in that Jumper.
p3310
sg4
I8
sa(dp3311
g2
VI don't know.
p3312
sg4
I3
sa(dp3313
g2
VI can't. The Jumper's in control.
p3314
sg4
I6
sa(dp3315
g2
VThere's only one way to know.
p3316
sg4
I6
sa(dp3317
g2
V(checking his computer) I can confirm that. They're headed for hyperspace. (relieved) Look, I'm going to keep the cloak up for a while just to be sure, but, uh\u2026I think they bought it.
p3318
sg4
I33
sa(dp3319
g2
VThis is ridiculous.
p3320
sg4
I3
sa(dp3321
g2
VWell, couldn't we have met these people on a tropical beach planet, populated by tall, blonde women? Hmm?
p3322
sg4
I18
sa(dp3323
g2
VYes, well, I value my time, and this is a waste of it.
p3324
sg4
I13
sa(dp3325
g2
VYeah, well, it strikes me that this is a mission better suited to one of the lower echelon teams.
p3326
sg4
I19
sa(dp3327
g2
VAnd this is, like, what, the umpteenth tip we've followed up in search of a ZPM?
p3328
sg4
I16
sa(dp3329
g2
VLook, I just want to make it clear that every second I am out of my lab is a second the galaxy goes without another groundbreaking\u2014
p3330
sg4
I26
sa(dp3331
g2
V(upset) Oh, yeah. Fine.
p3332
sg4
I4
sa(dp3333
g2
V(speaking with his mouth full) Maybe you should start with how you managed to escape being culled by the Wraith Dart?
p3334
sg4
I21
sa(dp3335
g2
VHmm? What? When I get nervous, I get hungry.
p3336
sg4
I9
sa(dp3337
g2
V(still eating) It's the enzyme. It makes you almost immune to the Wraith stunner, so when you dematerialize from the Wraith Dart, you're awake, as opposed to\u2026
p3338
sg4
I27
sa(dp3339
g2
V(still eating) Yes, well, good for me.
p3340
sg4
I7
sa(dp3341
g2
VAre we speaking in relative terms, or, um\u2026
p3342
sg4
I8
sa(dp3343
g2
VExcuse me?
p3344
sg4
I2
sa(dp3345

VWhat?
p3346
sg4
I1
sa(dp3347
g2
V(standing, furious) Are you out of your mind?
p3348
sg4
I8
sa(dp3349
g2
V(screaming) No, I will not settle down! I have been drugged against my will, you little punk!
p3350
sg4
I17
sa(dp3351
g2
V(panicking) I'm itchy. I'm itchy all over. This is exactly what happened when I toked pot once in college.
p3352
sg4
I19
sa(dp3353
g2
VOh, that little bastard.
p3354
sg4
I4
sa(dp3355
g2
VThis is what I was afraid of.

sg4
I7
sa(dp3357
g2
VHe's taken all the necessary control crystals, something I showed him how to do on a mission, I might add.
p3358
sg4
I20
sa(dp3359
g2
VThat is the understatement of the year.
p3360
sg4
I7
sa(dp3361
g2
VOkay, well, this thing is useless, and I ate my face off, and I can tell you, I can feel it working. There's a good possibility that everything you're feeling right now might be psychosomatic.
p3362
sg4
I35
sa(dp3363
g2
VOh, is that right, Professor Science? Is that your expert opinion?
p3364
sg4
I11
sa(dp3365
g2
VWell, I can tell you, when they up the dosage, the side effects will be very real and very unpredictable.
p3366
sg4
I20
sa(dp3367
g2
VSeriously, I'm getting, uh\u2026 I'm getting chills and hot flashes, chills and hot flashes, again and again. None of you are feeling that?
p3368
sg4
I23
sa(dp3369
g2
VWhat about us?
p3370
sg4
I3
sa(dp3371
g2
VIt sounds delightful.
p3372
sg4
I3
sa(dp3373
g2
VCan't think of a better way of spending the afternoon.
p3374
sg4
I10
sa(dp3375
g2
VHow are you powering these Genii computers?
p3376
sg4
I7
sa(dp3377
g2
VCan't say that I have. What\u2014what do you do here?
p3378
sg4
I10
sa(dp3379
g2
VOh, yeah? How's that going?
p3380
sg4
I5
sa(dp3381
g2
VLike what?
p3382
sg4
I2
sa(dp3383
g2
VWhat? Why would they stop sharing information with each other?
p3384
sg4
I10
sa(dp3385
g2
VAll this because of Teyla?
p3386
sg4
I5
sa(dp3387
g2
VHuh. Fair enough.
p3388
sg4
I3
sa(dp3389
g2
VHuh. And you got all that from, uh\u2026this?
p3390
sg4
I8
sa(dp3391
g2
V(intrigued) It's okay. Let's see what you got.
p3392
sg4
I8
sa(dp3393
g2
VLet me see if I can couch what Colonel Sheppard means by "wow" in more explicit terms. That is a terrible plan.
p3394
sg4
I22
sa(dp3395
g2
VMade all the more frightening by the fact that you think it's a good plan.
p3396
sg4
I15
sa(dp3397
g2
V(agitated) What's right with it? Look, let's, just for a second, give in to reckless abandon and assume that it would be possible to plant a single charge large enough to destroy an entire hive ship.
p3398
sg4
I36
sa(dp3399
g2
VRegardless, the hive ship will be on a hyperspace pause, yes, but it will not enter the planet's atmosphere, nor will it take up any sort of stable orbit. It will be flying through space, which means that unless your enzyme allows you to jump a lot higher than you've let on\u2014
p3400
sg4
I52
sa(dp3401
g2
VOh, yeah? Really. What's that made out of, huh? Bark?
p3402
sg4
I10
sa(dp3403
g2
VIt is far from perfect.
p3404
sg4
I5
sa(dp3405
g2
VAre you honestly considering this?
p3406
sg4
I5
sa(dp3407
g2
VProbably not.
p3408
sg4
I2
sa(dp3409
g2
VAren't you the one not taking the enzyme? You're supposed to be the clear voice of reason here.
p3410
sg4
I18
sa(dp3411
g2
VEven if I could, I wouldn't. I'm sorry. Drug me all you want. I'm not doing this.
p3412
sg4
I17
sa(dp3413
g2
VLook, maybe you are on the enzyme. Maybe Ford lied, because no rational person would think that was a good plan.
p3414
sg4
I21
sa(dp3415
g2
VWhat are you talking about?
p3416
sg4
I5
sa(dp3417
g2
VHow?
p3418
sg4
I1
sa(dp3419
g2
VOf course.
p3420
sg4
I2
sa(dp3421
g2
VRight. Of course. (becoming abashed) You know, you see\u2026 I would have thought of that myself before I became a drug addict.
p3422
sg4
I22
sa(dp3423
g2
VI'm sorry. All right. Okay.
p3424
sg4
I5
sa(dp3425
g2
VNo.
p3426
sg4
I1
sa(dp3427
g2
VNo, no, no, no. You fire it up now, it'll all go up in smoke.
p3428
sg4
I15
sa(dp3429
g2
VOkay\u2026
p3430
sg4
I1
sa(dp3431
g2
VWe're close.
p3432
sg4
I2
sa(dp3433
g2
VHey.
p3434
sg4
I1
sa(dp3435
g2
VIt's ready.
p3436
sg4
I2
sa(dp3437
g2
VOkay, now\u2026 (to Jace) Could you move? Look, this is probably going to make you a little uneasy, but when the canopy forms, it's perfectly opaque.
p3438
sg4
I26
sa(dp3439
g2
VThe whole thing is one giant heads-up display. It'll show you all the pertinent information that you need.
p3440
sg4
I18
sa(dp3441
g2
VYeah, which is why I've installed an interface to translate a lot of the readouts.
p3442
sg4
I15
sa(dp3443
g2
VEnough to get you by.
p3444
sg4
I5
sa(dp3445
g2
VRight. Great.
p3446
sg4
I2
sa(dp3447
g2
VWhat? No! No, no, no, no, no!
p3448
sg4
I7
sa(dp3449
g2
VOh, do\u2014
p3450
sg4
I2
sa(dp3451
g2
VNo, I'm good, thanks.
p3452
sg4
I4
sa(dp3453
g2
V(nervous and frantic) Yeah, pretty sure. Look, don't you think that they should be back by now? I mean, how long does it take to fly there and fly back, you know? I mean, I say it's a minute from here to the gate, 10 tops from their gate to the hive ship, 20 to get in and lay a charge, and, what, like 10 more to get back out and home, right? So\u2026
p3454
sg4
I74
sa(dp3455
g2
VYeah, well, I subscribe to a different school of thought.
p3456
sg4
I10
sa(dp3457
g2
VYou can't possibly know that.
p3458
sg4
I5
sa(dp3459
g2
VYeah, well, I have a different gut\u2026
p3460
sg4
I7
sa(dp3461
g2
V\u2026feeling.
p3462
sg4
I1
sa(dp3463
g2
VOkay, they definitely should've been back by now. Seriously, am I the only one who thinks that maybe things haven't gone according to plan?
p3464
sg4
I24
sa(dp3465
g2
VOkay, look, we can't just sit here. We need we need\u2014 we need to do something.
p3466
sg4
I16
sa(dp3467
g2
VLike go get help. Look, we can dial the Stargate back to Atlantis where we have a ship, a fast ship with\u2014with\u2014with shields. We can fly to the Hive and rescue them if we need to.
p3468
sg4
I36
sa(dp3469
g2
VYes, I know that. But here's the good news. You're the ones guarding them. Look, all you have to do is get me the crystals. I can fix the DHD and look, you just have to walk into Ford's little room back there and get them.
p3470
sg4
I46
sa(dp3471
g2
VThen I can't dial the gate.
p3472
sg4
I6
sa(dp3473
g2
VWhat is this, an Abbott and Costello routine? Look, just give me the damn crystals.
p3474
sg4
I15
sa(dp3475
g2
VUnbelievable.
p3476
sg4
I1
sa(dp3477
g2
V(talking to himself) Okay. You can take them out, easy. Just a few well-placed karate chops, and\u2014and\u2014and\u2014and\u2014and then down they go. Piece of cake. (stepping away in doubt) That's\u2026What are you, an idiot? (going back) Desperate times, desperate measures.
p3478
sg4
I39
sa(dp3479
g2
V(holding up the bottle) That's one hell of a karate chop.
p3480
sg4
I11
sa(dp3481
g2
VLock and load.
p3482
sg4
I3
sa(dp3483
g2
VAnd that's what happens when you back a brilliant scientist into a corner!
p3484
sg4
I13
sa(dp3485
g2
VFocus. Focus\u2026
p3486
sg4
I2
sa(dp3487
g2
VControl crystals.
p3488
sg4
I2
sa(dp3489
g2
V(talking to himself in a high-pitched, nervous voice) Big dose. Big, big dose. But you needed it. You needed it to lay out the guards. Idiots. "You want the crystals? You're going to have to go through us." Well, I went through you, all right, didn't I? Like a hot knife through Jell-O. No, wait. Butter. Hot knife through butter. Oh, man, am I hungry. Okay, shut up, Rodney. Focus. Must finish dialing. Please, please work, please please please.
p3490
sg4
I79
sa(dp3491
g2
VOkay, go home.
p3492
sg4
I3
sa(dp3493
g2
V(holding up one arm) I know what I need to do!
p3494
sg4
I11
sa(dp3495
g2
VThere's no time, no time. The planet, not Ford's, the one the ship's headed towards we need to get there and don't have much time. I was barely able to escape myself, but I managed to take out the guards. Oh, you should've seen me. I was amazing. I wish we got it on camera, because\u2014that's not the point\u2014
p3496
sg4
I59
sa(dp3497
g2
VYes. Yes. I mean, I don't know. I mean I had to take out the guards, and they were huge and dumb and stupid\u2014
p3498
sg4
I24
sa(dp3499
g2
VFord's guards. Didn't I mention Ford?
p3500
sg4
I6
sa(dp3501
g2
VYes! They were there too, and there were the two guards. They were huge and massive, and I had to take them out, so I had to inject some of the enzyme.
p3502
sg4
I32
sa(dp3503
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no no, no. I didn't take some of the enzyme. I took a lot of the enzyme, because I had to, because I had to take out the guards, which I did. And you should've seen me. I was amazing!
p3504
sg4
I44
sa(dp3505
g2
VYes. Yes. Now that I've taken the enzyme, yes!
p3506
sg4
I9
sa(dp3507
g2
VNo, no, no, I had to take the enzyme, because\u2026because I had to take out the guards! But that's not the point. The point is we don't have enough time. We need to stop the ship from getting to where the ship is going.
p3508
sg4
I44
sa(dp3509
g2
VWhere are we going? What are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to go to the infirmary. I want to go to the, uh\u2026the um\u2026
p3510
sg4
I29
sa(dp3511
g2
VDon't just stand there. Get me more enzyme.
p3512
sg4
I8
sa(dp3513
g2
VIt's the cave. Ford's cave. He's got a whole cabinet of it. There's dozens of vials.
p3514
sg4
I16
sa(dp3515
g2
V(weakly) No.
p3516
sg4
I2
sa(dp3517
g2
VYou don't have to scream at me!
p3518
sg4
I7
sa(dp3519
g2
VOh, this is fun for you, isn't it? Watching me like this.
p3520
sg4
I12
sa(dp3521
g2
V(frantic) What is this? Payback? You're jealous, huh? You're jealous of how vital I am to this mission. Vital, vital. Jealous of how I get to go off-world, and you get stuck in this stupid pathetic excuse for a hospital.
p3522
sg4
I40
sa(dp3523
g2
VJealous I get all the women and you don't!
p3524
sg4
I9
sa(dp3525
g2
VPlease, just give me a little enzyme, just enough to take the edge off. I'm dying here.
p3526
sg4
I17
sa(dp3527
g2
VYou think I don't know you're lying?
p3528
sg4
I7
sa(dp3529
g2
VYou are! You think I don't think you are, but you are. And don't think I won't forget it!
p3530
sg4
I19
sa(dp3531
g2
V(crying) I don't know. Just kill me.
p3532
sg4
I7
sa(dp3533
g2
V(shouting) No. Don't shout. I am right here.
p3534
sg4
I8
sa(dp3535
g2
VWhy, so you can kill me in private? Stab another knife in my back, huh?
p3536
sg4
I15
sa(dp3537
g2
VYou have no idea of the agony I'm going through.
p3538
sg4
I10
sa(dp3539
g2
VAh. Yes. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, as the idiom goes.
p3540
sg4
I9
sa(dp3541
g2
VYeah, it was very strange. The whole time I was under the influence of the enzyme, it felt like I was perfectly lucid. Was eloquent, even. I mean, it was you who wasn't making any sense or listening to reason. It was very peculiar. I think I kind of understand how Ford must've been feeling this whole time.
p3542
sg4
I58
sa(dp3543
g2
VI don't know, exactly, but I think I can figure it out. I told you Ford's alive.
p3544
sg4
I17
sa(dp3545
g2
VThe man is nothing if not resilient. He's been busy, too. He's gathered himself together a little gang, doped them all up on the enzyme. They're the ones that caught us, drugged us, and coerced Sheppard Teyla, and Ronon into joining them on a mission to destroy a Hive ship.
p3546
sg4
I50
sa(dp3547
g2
VYeah. They managed to steal themselves a Dart. Like I said, he's been busy. Look, when they didn't return from the mission, I realized something had obviously gone wrong. Now, I have the coordinates to the planet that the Hive ship was headed towards to cull.
p3548
sg4
I46
sa(dp3549
g2
VYeah, at the very least we can warn the planet of the impending culling.
p3550
sg4
I14
sa(dp3551
g2
VVery good.
p3552
sg4
I2
sa(dp3553
g2
VAccording to Ford's intel, Edowin has a space gate. We can get there quickly in a puddle jumper, but we wouldn't be able to do much more than just warn people of the impending culling.
p3554
sg4
I35
sa(dp3555
g2
VYes.
p3556
sg4
I1
sa(dp3557
g2
VWe should.
p3558
sg4
I2
sa(dp3559
g2
VIt'll be close, yes, but using the Daedalus, we might be able to get a radio lock on Sheppard and the team inside the Hive ship. If they're still alive, we can beam them out.
p3560
sg4
I35
sa(dp3561
g2
VWe won't be able to make radio contact from behind the planet.
p3562
sg4
I12
sa(dp3563
g2
VWhat if they jam us like they did before?
p3564
sg4
I9
sa(dp3565
g2
VThere's two of them!
p3566
sg4
I4
sa(dp3567
g2
VWell, there was only one.
p3568
sg4
I5
sa(dp3569
g2
VI can see that!
p3570
sg4
I4
sa(dp3571
g2
V(into radio) Which doesn't necessarily mean they're not on either of the ships. They could've had their radios taken from them.
p3572
sg4
I21
sa(dp3573
g2
V(into radio, disappointed) We're almost there now.
p3574
sg4
I7
sa(dp3575
g2
VThey're jamming us again.
p3576
sg4
I4
sa(dp3577
g2
VNot much. We're already down twenty percent.
p3578
sg4
I7
sa(dp3579
g2
VLook. You see that?
p3580
sg4
I4
sa(dp3581
g2
VIt's a Dart firing on one of the Hive ships.
p3582
sg4
I10
sa(dp3583
g2
V(realizing) Sheppard!
p3584
sg4
I2
sa(dp3585
g2
V(shocked) The blast has destroyed everything in the fifteen-thousand-meter radius.
p3586
sg4
I10
sa(dp3587
g2
VWhy aren't you dead?
p3588
sg4
I4
sa(dp3589
g2
VNo, no, I mean, well you know what I mean. Why aren't you\u2026dead?
p3590
sg4
I13
sa(dp3591
g2
VHuh. And where is Ford?
p3592
sg4
I5
sa(dp3593
g2
VWhat does that mean?
p3594
sg4
I4
sa(dp3595
g2
VComputer diagnostics, strictly routine. I've got security camera footage.
p3596
sg4
I9
sa(dp3597
g2
VI don't know. It's a camera malfunction.
p3598
sg4
I7
sa(dp3599
g2
VActually, I think it makes sense. Look, Colonel Caldwell was right. There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill someone, at least not normally.
p3600
sg4
I25
sa(dp3601
g2
VIt's possible there was some sort of isolated power surge in this section. That would explain the lost camera, the malfunctioning door.
p3602
sg4
I22
sa(dp3603
g2
VWell, like I said, it's possible. Look, I recommend we drop out of hyperspace, run a full diagnostic on the power distribution systems.
p3604
sg4
I23
sa(dp3605
g2
VThat's true. I just think that if we\u2026
p3606
sg4
I8
sa(dp3607
g2
VColonel Caldwell.
p3608
sg4
I2
sa(dp3609
g2
VI realize you've already made it clear that you're not big on the whole dropping-out-of-hyperspace thing, which I understand, given that we would emerge in an uncharted section of the Pegasus galaxy with who knows what waiting for us around the corner\u2026
p3610
sg4
I42
sa(dp3611
g2
VLook, I think it's possible\u2026 that Dr. Monroe's death might not have been an accident.
p3612
sg4
I15
sa(dp3613
g2
VI checked the power distribution logs against the time-code on the security camera. There was an unexplained spike, but it happened a full thirty seconds after the camera went out.
p3614
sg4
I30
sa(dp3615
g2
VSo that means the malfunction in the door and the camera were not caused by the same problem. Major Sheppard was right. That's too much of a coincidence.
p3616
sg4
I28
sa(dp3617
g2
VRight. (to himself) That's going to take some getting used to.
p3618
sg4
I11
sa(dp3619
g2
VNo, there's something else. It's looks like Dr. Monroe was in the process of enabling certain computer security protocols. They're designed to isolate and shut down corrupted programs.
p3620
sg4
I28
sa(dp3621
g2
VI don't know. That's just it. He was killed before he could finish.
p3622
sg4
I13
sa(dp3623
g2
VI know this sounds crazy, but there is definitely more going on here than random malfunctions.
p3624
sg4
I16
sa(dp3625
g2
VAny indication that someone's been tampering with the ship's computers.
p3626
sg4
I10
sa(dp3627
g2
VNot really, no.
p3628
sg4
I3
sa(dp3629
g2
VWhat was that?
p3630
sg4
I3
sa(dp3631
g2
VLook, just check the major systems. Propulsion, navigation, life support. Look for anything out of the ordinary. Lindstrom and I will check power distribution, see if we can figure out what caused the power spike.
p3632
sg4
I35
sa(dp3633
g2
VIt's going to take a while. (whispers) Don't stare. He hates it when people stare.
p3634
sg4
I15
sa(dp3635
g2
V(whispers) Intergalactic hyperdrive technology is kind of new to us, so we need his help.
p3636
sg4
I15
sa(dp3637
g2
VLindstrom?
p3638
sg4
I1
sa(dp3639
g2
VOkay, let's speed this up. You take the logs, and I am going to take a look at the\u2026 junction box.
p3640
sg4
I21
sa(dp3641
g2
VI've got nothing. You?
p3642
sg4
I4
sa(dp3643
g2
VWhat?
p3644
sg4
I1
sa(dp3645
g2
VWell, what?
p3646
sg4
I2
sa(dp3647
g2
VLindstrom! Lindstrom!
p3648
sg4
I2
sa(dp3649
g2
V(into wall-mounted video communicator) Lindstrom!
p3650
sg4
I5
sa(dp3651
g2
VLindstrom! You all right?
p3652
sg4
I4
sa(dp3653
g2
VI don't know. Just sit tight. We're going to need to shut down the leak and vent the room.
p3654
sg4
I19
sa(dp3655
g2
VLindstrom!
p3656
sg4
I1
sa(dp3657
g2
VLindstrom, are you reading me?
p3658
sg4
I5
sa(dp3659
g2
VLindstrom, are you reading me?
p3660
sg4
I5
sa(dp3661
g2
VWhat the hell are you doing?!
p3662
sg4
I6
sa(dp3663
g2
VThe airlock's opening! Override the system!
p3664
sg4
I6
sa(dp3665
g2
VLindstrom!
p3666
sg4
I1
sa(dp3667
g2
V(frantic) Lindstrom!
p3668
sg4
I2
sa(dp3669
g2
V(horrified) Oh my God.
p3670
sg4
I4
sa(dp3671
g2
VI already told you, I'm fine.
p3672
sg4
I6
sa(dp3673
g2
VLindstrom found something. He was trying to tell me what it was when the leak happened.
p3674
sg4
I16
sa(dp3675
g2
VWe were trying to trace the source of the power spike that killed Dr. Monroe.
p3676
sg4
I15
sa(dp3677
g2
VA lot of people knew we were running diagnostics, but no one knew we were in that particular room at that exact moment.
p3678
sg4
I23
sa(dp3679
g2
VAssuming it's a he.
p3680
sg4
I4
sa(dp3681
g2
VAlmost everybody. That's what you get for assembling a team of brilliant scientists.
p3682
sg4
I13
sa(dp3683
g2
VHe's right. They did a full decontamination sweep back on Earth. They would've found something.
p3684
sg4
I15
sa(dp3685
g2
VUh, Colonel, with all due respect, some of those people could be extremely helpful in the investigation.
p3686
sg4
I17
sa(dp3687
g2
VFor what? What are you looking at?
p3688
sg4
I7
sa(dp3689
g2
VIt's a virus?
p3690
sg4
I3
sa(dp3691
g2
VWhere did you find it?
p3692
sg4
I5
sa(dp3693
g2
VSo it's spreading?
p3694
sg4
I3
sa(dp3695
g2
VWhat do you mean?
p3696
sg4
I4
sa(dp3697
g2
VYeah\u2026
p3698
sg4
I1
sa(dp3699
g2
VAirperson\u2026 don't be there.
p3700
sg4
I4
sa(dp3701
g2
V(punching keys) Just checking something. I'm sure it is impossible.
p3702
sg4
I10
sa(dp3703
g2
VCrap.
p3704
sg4
I1
sa(dp3705
g2
VI just ran it through a translation program. It's Wraith.
p3706
sg4
I10
sa(dp3707
g2
VIt was probably downloaded during our last little encounter.
p3708
sg4
I9
sa(dp3709
g2
VWell, in all likelihood, it was transmitted in a compressed format. It took a while to unfold, to spread to the point where it could adversely affect our systems. I think it probably happened during your return flight to Earth. Since then, it's been dormant, waiting for some kind of a trigger.
p3710
sg4
I52
sa(dp3711
g2
VPossibly the fact that we're once again in proximity to Wraith territory. I think it was ultimately designed to take control of the navigational system. Fly the ship right to them.
p3712
sg4
I31
sa(dp3713
g2
VIt's what they've wanted all along. A new feeding ground.
p3714
sg4
I10
sa(dp3715
g2
VThat's what I'm trying to tell you. It was the virus.
p3716
sg4
I11
sa(dp3717
g2
VLook, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence. It can think for itself, adapt itself to new situations\u2026
p3718
sg4
I17
sa(dp3719
g2
VExactly. It knew that Lindstrom and Monroe were going to expose it, so it got rid of them.
p3720
sg4
I18
sa(dp3721
g2
VWell, not entirely. You have to remember that there are hundreds of individual computers onboard. A lot of them are interconnected, so we tend to think of them as one big machine, but that's not really the case. There are dozens of backups and redundancies and some systems, like life support, are deliberately isolated.
p3722
sg4
I54
sa(dp3723
g2
VThat was the good news. The bad news is some of the more complex systems, like navigation and propulsion, require a certain amount of inter-connectivity to function properly. In all likelihood, the virus has spread so far through those systems, that to isolate it would make the ship impossible to fly. Until we figure out a way to get rid of it, we're stuck here.
p3724
sg4
I65
sa(dp3725
g2
VIt's the virus. This is what I mean by "adapting itself to new situations." It doesn't have enough control yet to fly us to the Wraith so, instead, it's calling the Wraith to us. And right now, we are sitting ducks.
p3726
sg4
I41
sa(dp3727
g2
VTheoretically, we should be able to cut power to the long-range transmitter. It won't be able to send messages, but neither will the virus.
p3728
sg4
I24
sa(dp3729
g2
VWell, it's pretty smart. So far, everything we've tried, it's been one step ahead of us. (to the Bridge Lieutenant) Try it now.
p3730
sg4
I23
sa(dp3731
g2
VAll right, that leaves us one choice. We need to do a full system shutdown. We'll wipe everything, reboot, load clean backups.
p3732
sg4
I22
sa(dp3733
g2
VAbsolutely\u2026 I think.
p3734
sg4
I3
sa(dp3735
g2
VWell, it's not like the ship's got an on/off button. We'll need some time to prepare, say an hour, maybe two.
p3736
sg4
I21
sa(dp3737
g2
VI should've seen this coming. The navigational software on the F-302 is compatible with our sub-light systems, which would be infected. The virus must've uploaded itself onto his ship.
p3738
sg4
I29
sa(dp3739
g2
VThat would work. Those systems are still clean.
p3740
sg4
I8
sa(dp3741
g2
VAh. Slight problem.
p3742
sg4
I3
sa(dp3743
g2
VThe transport beam is tied to an Asgard sensor. It's what we use to lock on to targets.
p3744
sg4
I18
sa(dp3745
g2
VSo that particular piece of equipment was located in the array that we just destroyed.
p3746
sg4
I15
sa(dp3747
g2
V(clicking his fingers) I can key the system to lock on to his radio signal. That's what they used to do on the Prometheus before they had Asgard sensors.
p3748
sg4
I29
sa(dp3749
g2
V(covering his radio mouthpiece) The truth is it's never been tested from this distance.
p3750
sg4
I14
sa(dp3751
g2
VWe're ready. I'm beaming him directly to the bridge.
p3752
sg4
I9
sa(dp3753
g2
VRight.
p3754
sg4
I1
sa(dp3755
g2
V(nudging an airman out of the way) Move.
p3756
sg4
I8
sa(dp3757
g2
V(nearly bumping into Sheppard) Do you mind?
p3758
sg4
I7
sa(dp3759
g2
V(into radio) All right, Colonel, we're ready.
p3760
sg4
I7
sa(dp3761
g2
VAnd\u2026
p3762
sg4
I1
sa(dp3763
g2
V(into radio) All systems are functioning normally. No sign of the virus. Looks like it worked, Colonel.
p3764
sg4
I17
sa(dp3765
g2
V(into radio) I can get you sub-light.
p3766
sg4
I7
sa(dp3767
g2
VDammit!
p3768
sg4
I1
sa(dp3769
g2
VThe virus. It's back. Now it's got full control of sub-light navigation.
p3770
sg4
I12
sa(dp3771
g2
VThey were. When we did the reboot, there was no sign of the virus. This shouldn't be happening.
p3772
sg4
I18
sa(dp3773
g2
VWe did. We must have missed something.
p3774
sg4
I7
sa(dp3775
g2
VThe virus has access to our database. It knows our tactics, our tendencies\u2026
p3776
sg4
I13
sa(dp3777
g2
V(with a flash of inspiration) Wait a minute. There was a situation similar to this back at Stargate Command. I remember reading the report. An alien entity took control of the base computer, so they did a system shutdown to destroy it. It survived by loading itself onto a MALP.
p3778
sg4
I50
sa(dp3779
g2
VNo, but we've got a bay full of F-302s. We already know the virus can upload itself onto the ship's navigational computers, but it could've used any of those ships as a hiding place while we wiped the Daedalus system clean. It's the only possible explanation.
p3780
sg4
I46
sa(dp3781
g2
VSo, we physically pull the memory storage modules from the 302s. We do another shutdown. That should so the trick.
p3782
sg4
I20
sa(dp3783
g2
VIt's not working.
p3784
sg4
I3
sa(dp3785
g2
V(a look of horrified realization on his face) It's the virus. It must know what we're trying to do.
p3786
sg4
I19
sa(dp3787
g2
VWell, it's thinking ahead, anticipating our moves, like in a chess match.
p3788
sg4
I12
sa(dp3789
g2
VI don't get to play much. It's tough finding challenging opponents.
p3790
sg4
I11
sa(dp3791
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. The transport beam wasn't designed to beam from one point to another point inside the ship. We could end up re-materializing half inside a wall.
p3792
sg4
I32
sa(dp3793
g2
VRight. Of course. Why not?
p3794
sg4
I5
sa(dp3795
g2
V(surprised) It worked.
p3796
sg4
I3
sa(dp3797
g2
VOh, boy.
p3798
sg4
I2
sa(dp3799
g2
VWe should really, really, really be dead right now.
p3800
sg4
I9
sa(dp3801
g2
VWe pulled all the memory units. Another shutdown should work.
p3802
sg4
I10
sa(dp3803
g2
V(having a panic attack) You know, I've never actually been inside one of these before today. It's a little, uh, cramped, huh?
p3804
sg4
I22
sa(dp3805
g2
VRight. Quick question, though, just out of curiosity. How much, uh, like, air do these things carry?
p3806
sg4
I17
sa(dp3807
g2
VI'm just saying, because if this doesn't work, and we have to come up with another plan, who knows how long we could get stuck in here, and so it\u2026 it\u2026
p3808
sg4
I31
sa(dp3809
g2
VThis should have worked. We've disabled every navigational computer in this bay. There's nowhere else on the ship the virus could hide.
p3810
sg4
I22
sa(dp3811
g2
VWhat are you talking about?
p3812
sg4
I5
sa(dp3813
g2
VWhat are you doing?
p3814
sg4
I4
sa(dp3815
g2
VYeah, well, that makes sense, but we can't go after it. We have no computer-assisted navigation.
p3816
sg4
I16
sa(dp3817
g2
VWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I haven't got my belt.
p3818
sg4
I10
sa(dp3819
g2
VWhat is that beeping?
p3820
sg4
I4
sa(dp3821
g2
VWhoa. What happened to inertial dampeners?
p3822
sg4
I6
sa(dp3823
g2
VOh, now he tells me.
p3824
sg4
I5
sa(dp3825
g2
VAny point in mentioning we have even less protection in this ship than we did in the Daedalus?
p3826
sg4
I18
sa(dp3827
g2
VI didn't think so.
p3828
sg4
I4
sa(dp3829
g2
VIs it just me or is it getting a little hotter in here?
p3830
sg4
I13
sa(dp3831
g2
VSee, the thing is, I have very fair skin. I tend to burn very easily.
p3832
sg4
I15
sa(dp3833
g2
VReally?
p3834
sg4
I1
sa(dp3835
g2
VMy nose is peeling. Do you have moisturizer?
p3836
sg4
I8
sa(dp3837
g2
VWe should get that.
p3838
sg4
I4
sa(dp3839
g2
VWhat's going on?
p3840
sg4
I3
sa(dp3841
g2
V(defensively) I was\u2026 I was right in the middle of\u2026
p3842
sg4
I10
sa(dp3843
g2
VWait a second\u2026 seven\u2026 seven-three-six? The UV index there during the day something like a thousand.
p3844
sg4
I16
sa(dp3845
g2
V(defensively) What?! I want to get Ford back as much as anyone else, but have you seen my complexion?
p3846
sg4
I19
sa(dp3847
g2
VYes, it's very fair.
p3848
sg4
I4
sa(dp3849
g2
VExtremely fair.
p3850
sg4
I2
sa(dp3851
g2
VThis isn't fair.
p3852
sg4
I3
sa(dp3853
g2
VI told you so.
p3854
sg4
I4
sa(dp3855
g2
VDr. Parrish believes that the indigenous plant life retains enough residual radioactivity absorbed during the daylight to, um, well, to screw up our sensors.
p3856
sg4
I24
sa(dp3857
g2
VYes\u2026
p3858
sg4
I1
sa(dp3859
g2
V(calling after Sheppard) Or the perfect place to be exposed to dangerously high levels of solar radiation!
p3860
sg4
I17
sa(dp3861
g2
V(smiling) Could it be the simulated tropical aroma of cocoa butter?
p3862
sg4
I11
sa(dp3863
g2
VLike they haven't been tipped off by the Aqua Velva?
p3864
sg4
I10
sa(dp3865
g2
V(looking at his watch) Yeah, well, the sun will be up in two hours, forty-three minutes, and\u2026 ten seconds.
p3866
sg4
I19
sa(dp3867
g2
VSo we'll be cold and miserable. Look, the cloud cover will depreciate a small percentage of UV rays, but ninety-five percent of deadly is still deadly.
p3868
sg4
I26
sa(dp3869
g2
VOh, yes, and Dr. Parrish has a PhD in what? Right. Botany.
p3870
sg4
I12
sa(dp3871
g2
VHere. Try some. SPF one hundred.
p3872
sg4
I6
sa(dp3873
g2
VYou can't buy this kind of protection. I make it myself. Waterproof, too.
p3874
sg4
I13
sa(dp3875
g2
VSo exactly what kind of special training do you guys have to go through to get this sort of mission?
p3876
sg4
I20
sa(dp3877
g2
VYeah, you know. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. It's a great place to start.
p3878
sg4
I14
sa(dp3879
g2
VYes.
p3880
sg4
I1
sa(dp3881
g2
VYeah, I was afraid of that.
p3882
sg4
I6
sa(dp3883

V(sarcastically) Oh yeah. When we weren't out on harrowing missions, we used to hang out together. I'd share my dreams of a self-sustaining fusion. He would talk of how you could sever a man's torso with a P-90.

sa(dp3897
g2
V(nervously) Ford? You there? It's your\u2026 best friend Rodney. Rodney McKay. Everyone\u2026 misses you back at Atlantis, and Dr. Beckett's figured out a way to help you, so you've just got to trust me and\u2026

VWhat is it?
p3900
sg4
I3
sa(dp3901
g2
V(into radio) Elizabeth, it's Rodney. Yes, hi. There are four class one radiation suits in med lab storage. We'll need them all. (to Lorne) What? Look, I know there's not enough for us all, but we can\u2026 take turns.
p3902
sg4
I39
sa(dp3903
g2
V(to the departing Marines) Hey, wait, aren't any of you going to\u2026 ah\u2026 Okay, that\u2026 that's just reckless. There are four suits.
p3904
sg4
I22
sa(dp3905
g2
VNo, but by my calculations, we've been exposed to three hundred and twenty-seven millisieverts since the sun came up. May not sound like much to you, but I've been keeping a running tally of my lifetime exposure to radiation. That's, uh, X-rays, cellphones, plane rides, that whole unfortunate Genii nuclear reactor thing. My God, last week, we flew dangerously close to the corona of a sun. As it is, I may have to forego reproducing.
p3906
sg4
I75
sa(dp3907
g2
VIt's so hot.
p3908
sg4
I3

VI can't breathe. I've got to stop.
p3912

p3918
sg4
I13
sa(dp3919

VOh, really? I thought\u2026 it feels longer.
p3920
sg4
I7
sa(dp3921

VWell, as a matter of fact, I, um\u2026 wait a minute. See, why would you say that now?
p3922
sg4
I18
sa(dp3923

VYeah, yeah, like I didn't see that one coming.
p3924
sg4

sg4

sa(dp3951

VHmm.
p3952
sg4

p3962

p3964
sg4
I2
sa(dp3965

sg4
I3
sa(dp3973
g2
VHow do you know?
p3974
sg4
I4
sa(dp3975
g2
VOkay, so what does the guy want with Sheppard and Teyla?
p3976
sg4
I11
sa(dp3977
g2
VBecause I am tired, and you have no idea where you're going.
p3978
sg4

VWe've been walking around in circles for hours.
p3980

g2
VLieutenant Colonel Sheppard.
p3984
sg4
I3
sa(dp3985
g2
VHey, I never said that, although the fact that you keep referring to yourself in the third person does indicate clinical dissociation.
p3986

I22
sa(dp3987
g2
VWill you relax? I just\u2026
p3988
sg4
I5
sa(dp3989
g2
VShoot me? When did this escalate to physical violence?
p3990
sg4
I9
sa(dp3991
g2
V(shouting hysterically) All right, you want to shoot me, shoot me. Fine. I don't care. It'll just save me from suffering one of the many horribly painful deaths I have in line for me having been exposed to this much radiation, and quite frankly, it'll prove just how far gone you are.
p3992
sg4
I52
sa(dp3993
g2
VNow, I'm heading back to the Jumper, and you're welcome to join me!
p3994
sg4
I13
sa(dp3995
g2
V(screaming) Are you crazy? You could have killed me!
p3996
sg4
I9
sa(dp3997
g2
VYou don't have to be alone, Ford. Look, this drug is messing with your head. Come back to the Jumper with me, we'll go back to Atlantis, and Dr. Beckett may even be able to figure out a way for you to keep all your new super powers.
p3998
sg4
I48
sa(dp3999

VFord! No!
p4004
sg4
I2
sa(dp4005
g2
VLook, if you'd just turn on your radio, we could hear what's happening. The others must have called for backup by now. Maybe Sheppard and Teyla don't even need rescuing anymore.

VYeah, I've had it. Drop your weapons now!
p4020

VOh, boy.
p4024

sa(dp4029
g2
VYes, look at me. It's funny, huh?
p4030
sg4
I7
sa(dp4031
g2
VDid you set this up? That's clever.
p4032
sg4
I7
sa(dp4033
g2
VNo, huh? Well, I'm glad we can both\u2026 still laugh about this together. Ha, ha\u2026 How about cutting me down now?
p4034
sg4
I21
sa(dp4035
g2
VWhat? What do you mean, "still"? When did this escalate to killing?
p4036
sg4
I12
sa(dp4037
g2
VIt's a flesh wound! I knew it wasn't going to hurt you! You're\u2026 you're SuperFord. Remember?
p4038

I16
sa(dp4039
g2
V(frantic) Wait! You can't kill an unarmed upside-down man!

VHi. It's Dr. Rodney McKay.
p4042

VCould you, um\u2026get me down, please?
p4044
sg4
I6
sa(dp4045
g2
V(raising his finger) I shot him too.
p4046
sg4
I7
sa(dp4047
g2
VI can tell you from the quality time I spent with Ford, he was definitely not thinking straight.
p4048
sg4
I18
sa(dp4049

VWhat are you talking about?
p4050
sg4
I5
sa(dp4051

VHow would you know?
p4056
sg4
I4
sa(dp4057
g2
VAnd I'm sure it is none of your business. This is inappropriate field conversation.
p4058
sg4
I14
sa(dp4059

VYes, and maybe you should just do your job, which is to protect us\u2026
p4060

p4062

VYou said "what?"
p4078
sg4

I10

VYes. Where are you?
p4082
sg4
I4
sa(dp4083

VNo, no, I'm talking to Cadman. Shut up for a second.
p4084

g2
VWho got us out of the Dart?
p4098

V(shaking his head) No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
p4100

VCadman's not trapped in the Dart.
p4102

p4104
sg4
I7
sa(dp4105
g2
VOh, nice work.
p4106
sg4
I3
sa(dp4107
g2
VSo instead of waiting to understand what it was that you were doing you just sort of mashed on the keyboard, hoping something would happen?
p4108

sa(dp4109
g2
VHe doesn't know how to fix it.
p4110
sg4

sa(dp4111
g2
V(pointing at his head) Talking to her.
p4112
sg4
I7
sa(dp4113
g2
VNo, no, not her thoughts, thank God. I can hear when she's speaking, or when, I suppose, she's trying to speak.
p4114
sg4
I21
sa(dp4115
g2
VWell, we can't all be track stars, now, can we? (to the others present) It was her again.
p4116
sg4
I18
sa(dp4117
g2
VI'm not crazy. I just have another consciousness in my brain.
p4118
sg4
I11
sa(dp4119
g2
VI'm sure I do, but only because Dr. Fumbles McStupid over here was in way over his head.
p4120
sg4
I18
sa(dp4121
g2
VI am perfectly capable of doing both at the same time. Now, I assume you've tried to run one of our own generators\u2026
p4122
sg4
I23
sa(dp4123
g2
VOkay, okay. I'm sure if maybe we can write an interface program that can take care of all\u2026
p4124

p4136

I3
sa(dp4137
g2
V(frustrated) Well, stop asking stupid questions.
p4138
sg4
I6
sa(dp4139

VI will get you out of here, okay? But just be a good little girlie and keep quiet.
p4140
sg4
I18

p4142

VAll you had to do was keep your mouth shut while I was working.
p4154

VTalking on the radio. You're well, I take it?
p4162
sg4

VOh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, but everything's fine now. It's all been sorted out. Back to normal.
p4164
sg4
I17
sa(dp4165

VYes, yes. Yes, I tell you, I'm very much looking forward to it. In fact, I'm sure it'll be a, you know, a wonderful\u2026evening, and whatnot.
p4166

I2
sa(dp4171
g2
VThis is hell. This is my own personal hell.
p4172
sg4
I9
sa(dp4173
g2
VAnd how do you feel you're qualified to help us with this problem, huh?
p4174
sg4
I14
sa(dp4175
g2
VIn any sense of the definition, not a couple.
p4176
sg4
I9
sa(dp4177
g2
VThat's very clever, but we're not equal forces.
p4178
sg4
I8
sa(dp4179
g2
VAnd what I mean by that is that she's just a voice in my head. I have control of the body.
p4180
sg4
I21
sa(dp4181
g2
VWell, if she could've, she would have by now.
p4182
sg4
I9

VWhy would I do that?
p4184
sg4
I5
sa(dp4185

VMaybe.
p4186

p4194
sg4
I12
sa(dp4195
g2
V(as Cadman) I don't know. Let me try.
p4196
sg4
I8

g2
VOkay. That's enough of that.
p4198
sg4
I5
sa(dp4199
g2
VWell, progress won't be necessary if we can get her out of here. Now, I've calmed down. So has she. Now let me get back to work.
p4200
sg4
I27
sa(dp4201
g2
VReally? Oh, she's fine with this, by the way.
p4202
sg4
I9
sa(dp4203
g2
VSo, yeah. Should I\u2026
p4204
sg4
I4
sa(dp4205
g2
VAll right. Let's give this bad boy a try. (to the German scientist) Start her up, but slowly ease her into it.
p4206
sg4
I22
sa(dp4207
g2
VMaybe you just don't understand them.
p4208
sg4
I6
sa(dp4209

VWhat the hell happened?!
p4210
sg4
I4
sa(dp4211

g2
VWell, you heard right.
p4222
sg4
I4
sa(dp4223
g2
VLook, as much as I'd like to pretend that this is remotely your fault, the thought of what would've happened if you hadn't shot the Dart down is, uh\u2026
p4224
sg4
I29
sa(dp4225
g2
VNo, you're cool. I'm fine.
p4226
sg4

V(as Cadman) Mm. Mainly because of Cadman. She's calming, you know? Between you and me, I am damn lucky it was her.
p4234

I22
sa(dp4235
g2
V(as Cadman) Oh, she's asleep, can't hear a thing.

I10
sa(dp4239

V(as Cadman) (pulling his hand away) Ahem. Hey, um\u2026 You want to, uh, do me a favor? You know, you want to ride shotgun on this date tomorrow night?

I29
sa(dp4241
g2
V(as Cadman) Katie.
p4242
sg4
I3
sa(dp4243
g2
V(as Cadman) Well, I've canceled on her so many times. I don't want to mess this up.
p4244
sg4
I17
sa(dp4245
g2
V(as Cadman) Listen, I don't think it's any big secret that I am terrible with women. Having someone there to cut me off when I start making a fool of myself would be a great help. I'd consider it a personal favor.
p4246
sg4
I42
sa(dp4247
g2
V(as Cadman) Great.
p4248
sg4
I3
sa(dp4249

V(as Cadman) And thanks.

I4
sa(dp4255
g2
V(grabbing his watch) It is 2:00 in the afternoon. Where the hell are we?
p4256
sg4
I14
sa(dp4257
g2
VThat is a prescription mattress. I need that for my back. Now, how the hell did we get here?
p4258

p4262

I5
sa(dp4263

VWe have got to set some boundaries.
p4264
sg4
I7
sa(dp4265
g2
VOkay, you've crossed a line here, Cadman.
p4266
sg4
I7
sa(dp4267
g2
VWhy are my legs burning?
p4268
sg4
I5
sa(dp4269
g2
VOh, why in the world would you do that?
p4270
sg4
I9
sa(dp4271
g2
VOkay, okay, this is very important. Did you ingest any citrus? I, I am, I'm deathly allergic to citrus.
p4272
sg4
I19
sa(dp4273
g2
V"Uh-oh?"
p4274
sg4
I1
sa(dp4275
g2
VI would love to, but every muscle in my body is sore from your stupid workout.
p4276
sg4
I16
sa(dp4277
g2
VMore of the same. Why? You have any ideas?
p4278
sg4
I9
sa(dp4279
g2
VDon't look.
p4280
sg4
I2
sa(dp4281
g2
VNo, it is completely out of the question.
p4282
sg4
I8
sa(dp4283
g2
VOh, yes, imagine that. I'd rather go it alone.
p4284
sg4
I9
sa(dp4285
g2
VThank for the offer, Cyrano, but I think I'll pass.
p4286
sg4
I10
sa(dp4287
g2
VI'm sure that has nothing to do with my current situation.
p4288
sg4
I11
sa(dp4289

VThis is why this happened?

sg4
I5

sa(dp4301
g2
V(whispers) Yes. Yes. Yes\u2026 (aloud) A toast. (raising his wineglass to Katie) To you. We've been working together for\u2026 some time now, a short time, but, um, in that time, I've often found our interchanges very, um\u2026
p4302
sg4
I37
sa(dp4303
g2
VAh\u2026 what I mean to say is that you are very funny and smart and\u2026 and, uh\u2026 And from what I can tell, you, you make a delicious salad. So\u2026 to you.
p4304
sg4
I32

VSo, um\u2026 Do you, uh\u2026 um\u2026
p4306
sg4
I6
sa(dp4307
g2
VI forgot what I was going to say. What was it? Um\u2026
p4308
sg4
I12
sa(dp4309
g2
V(as Cadman) Okay, this is ridiculous.
p4310
sg4
I6
sa(dp4311
g2
V(as Cadman) Katie. I really like you. In fact, the past few months here have been made more livable, thanks to you. I wanted tonight to be special, but for reasons I can't go into now, I've got to leave.
p4312
sg4
I40
sa(dp4313
g2
V(as Cadman) But I don't want you to be insulted or to wonder whether or not I am interested in you, because I am. I am very, very interested.
p4314
sg4
I29
sa(dp4315
g2
V(as Cadman) See you soon.
p4316
sg4
I5
sa(dp4317
g2
VGive me back my body. We have to go back.
p4318
sg4
I10
sa(dp4319
g2
V(as Cadman) And do what? I bet that is the most honest you've ever been with a girl, and it wasn't even you.
p4320
sg4
I23
sa(dp4321
g2
VI can't believe you're doing this.
p4322
sg4

V(as Cadman) We just tried to do too much too fast, McKay.
p4324

VPlease. Please, go back.
p4326
sg4

I12
sa(dp4331
g2
V(as Cadman) Fine.
p4332

I3
sa(dp4333

V(as Cadman) Yay! Paper beats rock. We leave.

p4344
sg4

sa(dp4345

VMm. Great. Good thinking. Now, can we just see it?
p4346
sg4
I10
sa(dp4347
g2
VYes.
p4348
sg4
I1
sa(dp4349
g2
VThis is never going to end. I'm going to be stuck like this forever.
p4350
sg4
I14
sa(dp4351
g2
V(as McKay) I would like an apology.
p4352
sg4
I7
sa(dp4353
g2
V(as Cadman) Forget about it.
p4354
sg4
I5
sa(dp4355
g2
V(as Cadman) He doesn't ask permission when he takes over.
p4356
sg4
I10
sa(dp4357
g2
V(as McKay) You\u2026 because it's my body!
p4358
sg4
I7
sa(dp4359
g2
V(as Cadman) Yeah, and I'm a guest. Try and be a little more courteous.
p4360
sg4
I14
sa(dp4361
g2
V(as McKay) You see? Do you see what I have to put up with?
p4362
sg4
I14
sa(dp4363
g2
V(as Cadman) "Put up with?"
p4364
sg4
I5
sa(dp4365
g2
V(as McKay) (angrily) There's a lot of stuff that I am not doing right now that I would be doing.
p4366
sg4
I20
sa(dp4367
g2
V(as Cadman) I don't want to hear about it.
p4368
sg4

V(as Cadman) Huh.

p4374
sg4
I22
sa(dp4375
g2
V(as Cadman) Hey. You had a real opportunity to get inside the mind of a woman and actually expand your horizons. But, no.
p4376
sg4
I23
sa(dp4377
g2
V(becoming frantic) Did you ever, for a second, consider that I might not want to get inside a woman's\u2026
p4378
sg4
I19
sa(dp4379
g2

p4380
sg4
I2
sa(dp4381
g2
VWhy?
p4382
sg4
I1
sa(dp4383
g2
V(as Cadman) And that's not good.
p4384
sg4
I6
sa(dp4385
g2
VOf course it's not good.
p4386
sg4
I5
sa(dp4387
g2
VWhat do you mean?
p4388
sg4
I4
sa(dp4389
g2
VFine. She'll stop trying to take control of my body.
p4390
sg4
I10
sa(dp4391
g2
VOh, well, maybe if someone, say you, hadn't told her to try and take control in the first place, none of this would've happened.
p4392
sg4
I24
sa(dp4393
g2
VWhat happens to the person, the one who "lets go"?
p4394
sg4
I10
sa(dp4395
g2
V(as Cadman) They would disappear. I know they would, because I can already feel it happening to me. It's getting harder to be in here. It's taking more of an effort.
p4396
sg4
I31
sa(dp4397
g2
VHas it always been like that?
p4398
sg4
I6
sa(dp4399
g2
V(as Cadman) The past few hours. You haven't felt it too?
p4400
sg4
I11
sa(dp4401
g2
VOf course I have, but I just thought I was fighting with you.
p4402
sg4
I13
sa(dp4403
g2
V(as Cadman) Look, where are we at?
p4404
sg4
I7
sa(dp4405
g2
VBut?
p4406
sg4
I1
sa(dp4407
g2
VI'll do it.
p4408
sg4
I3
sa(dp4409
g2
VYou don't have to do this.
p4410
sg4
I6
sa(dp4411
g2
VOh, what makes you so sure?
p4412
sg4
I6
sa(dp4413
g2
VStop it. That's not true.
p4414
sg4
I5
sa(dp4415

V(as Cadman) Carson? I need something to write with.
p4416

p4420
sg4
I13
sa(dp4421
g2
VThe gate dematerializes you as you step into it, sending your information to the next gate so it can re-materialize you on the other side.
p4422
sg4
I25
sa(dp4423
g2
V(becoming excited) If we can take one of the crystal control modules from the gate and interface it with the Dart, we should be able to build a stable system.
p4424
sg4
I30
sa(dp4425
g2
VI don't have time to talk. I need to get this done before the next seizure.
p4426
sg4
I16
sa(dp4427
g2
VAll right, let's do this.
p4428
sg4
I5
sa(dp4429
g2
VI would prefer not to suffer a fatal seizure while we wait for you to round up more mice for testing, so, shall we?
p4430
sg4
I24
sa(dp4431
g2
VDon't try and talk me out of this. I may very well listen.
p4432
sg4
I13
sa(dp4433
g2
VWell, you're welcome. I can honestly say that the entire experience has been very, um\u2026
p4434
sg4
I15
sa(dp4435
g2
VAh. About time.
p4436
sg4
I3
sa(dp4437

VWell, what are we, mice or men?
p4438

VGood luck us both, hmm?
p4446

VOh, no.

VOh, good to hear. (to Zelenka) Nice work.
p4456

p4464

sa(dp4465

VThere's no sign of any settlements, at least nothing recent.

sa(dp4469
g2
VOh. Yes, well, other than that.
p4470
sg4
I6
sa(dp4471

p4474

p4486
sg4
I7

VWell, you could put up a sign.
p4488

VIt's funny\u2014I was about to make the exact same comment.
p4490

VI'd be very happy to see it.

VMargaret Thatcher wasn't creepy. Okay, well, maybe a little. She resembled an aunt of mine\u2014same hair style, facial structure, only my aunt was much taller and remarkably hirsute. Oddest thing\u2014she had to shave twice a day.

VWell, how close are we?
p4510

p4522

p4536

VWhat about the guards?
p4578

VOh, for God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you\u2014
p4580
sg4
I13
sa(dp4581
g2
VNobody could fix it. I don't care who you think I am, or what you think you saw in my eyes, but it is totally, completely impossible.
p4582
sg4
I27
sa(dp4583
g2
VI just said I couldn't.
p4584
sg4
I5
sa(dp4585
g2
VThere is one slight possibility.
p4586
sg4
I5
sa(dp4587
g2
VI won't actually be able to fix the ship to fly out of here, but I might be able to cobble together enough power from secondary systems to activate the DHD. That way, we can dial the gate and leave on foot. When I say "might," I mean probably not. It's a long shot at best. I'd have to bypass the main power distribution conduit\u2014

I2
sa(dp4593

p4594
sg4
I8

VHow about the fact that they seriously outnumber us?
p4596
sg4
I9
sa(dp4597
g2
VWell, in a perfect world, two days.
p4598
sg4
I7
sa(dp4599

VRight now, uh, ten minutes, give or take.
p4600
sg4

p4602
sg4
I2
sa(dp4603

VWhy not?
p4604
sg4
I2
sa(dp4605
g2
VSlower than I expected, but faster than humanly possible.
p4606
sg4

g2
VOkay, and how about a snack? Maybe you'd like me to make you a nice sandwich?
p4608
sg4
I16
sa(dp4609
g2
VIt would be a miracle if I get the DHD back on, let alone the cloaking generator. And even if I could manage that, the power will be intermittent at best.
p4610

sa(dp4611
g2
V(annoyed) I get it!
p4612

VTwo minutes! Hold them that long, we're good to go.
p4614
sg4

VThat's it! I did it! We're ready to dial!
p4616
sg4
I9
sa(dp4617
g2
VOh, no, no. You don't have to do that. If you want me to dial the gate for you, that's fine. There are hundreds of suitable planets out there you can go to.
p4618
sg4
I33
sa(dp4619

p4626
sg4
I17
sa(dp4627
g2
VI lost power to the DHD.
p4628
sg4
I6
sa(dp4629
g2
VI told you the power feed would be intermittent at best. We should've dialed when I patched it instead of standing around talking\u2014
p4630

sa(dp4631
g2
VI don't know.
p4632
sg4

sa(dp4635

p4640
sg4
I2
sa(dp4641
g2
VI'm just saying, as a team veteran, to the new guy\u2014heavy lunch before mission departure, bad idea. I mean, even with the inertial dampeners, this whole flying thing is best done on an empty stomach.
p4642
sg4
I35
sa(dp4643
g2
VHey, I can eat frozen dinners without thawing them, and sometimes it even affects me.
p4644
sg4
I15
sa(dp4645
g2
VOh. Nothing. Life signs from the planet are negative.
p4646
sg4
I9
sa(dp4647
g2
VWell, the database is over ten thousand years old. You can bet things have changed around here.
p4648
sg4
I17

g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa. What if whatever put holes in it wants to put holes in us?
p4650
sg4
I16
sa(dp4651
g2
VThat would explain the lack of life signs.
p4652
sg4
I8
sa(dp4653
g2
VHold on. I'm picking up faint energy readings, coming from(pointing) there. Well, that explains how they would be able to put up such a good fight.
p4654
sg4
I26
sa(dp4655
g2
VBecause\u2026they were Ancients.
p4656
sg4
I3
sa(dp4657
g2
VDefinitely Ancient design. Their latest stuff, too. Their latest being ten thousand years old.
p4658

g2
VWorking on it.
p4660
sg4
I3
sa(dp4661
g2
VHah. Sorry, I wasn't listening, but it just struck me that this is an Ancient outpost. Why would the Wraith leave it intact?
p4662
sg4
I23
sa(dp4663
g2
V(examining tablet) Huh. All right. So\u2026
p4664
sg4
I6
sa(dp4665

VWith one major exception\u2014firepower. I mean, if that single outpost is responsible for destroying an entire Wraith fleet\u2014
p4666
sg4
I18
sa(dp4667
g2
VYeah, but at the end of the day, the outpost was still standing, and that means, uh\u2026 Well, I'm not sure what that means, but it means something definitely worth finding out.
p4668
sg4
I32
sa(dp4669
g2
VGood! Well, give me Optican and Collins, and Zelenka, if he's over the stomach flu. We'll try to access the computer's logbooks, see if we can decipher them\u2014

VOh. Good.
p4672

p4674

VNo.
p4676

sa(dp4677

VBut we don't know yet.
p4678
sg4
I5
sa(dp4679
g2
VThat's what we're working on.
p4680
sg4
I5
sa(dp4681
g2
VThe problem is that there's no direct link between it and the main power control systems, which, among other things led us to theorize it's an ancillary power supply for the weapon systems.
p4682
sg4
I33
sa(dp4683
g2
VSee that? See? See the way he lights up at the mention of that? It's like Dr. Vogel at the mention of pastry.
p4684
sg4
I23
sa(dp4685
g2
VThe sticking point is that there's no tie between the power generator and the primary capacitor.
p4686
sg4
I16
sa(dp4687
g2
VWhich, I'm sure, means nothing to you.
p4688

p4696

VLook, I just\u2026 I don't want you to get all excited over nothing.
p4698
sg4
I13
sa(dp4699
g2
VAll right, I'll give you a hint. It seems the Ancients were experimenting with high-energy physics on a level that we've never seen before.
p4700
sg4
I24
sa(dp4701
g2
VYes, "wow." I just\u2026I want to be sure.
p4702
sg4
I8
sa(dp4703
g2
V(into radio) Interesting? How about the greatest discovery of all time?
p4704
sg4
I11
sa(dp4705
g2
V(into radio) I wanted to send an encoded data-burst directly from the outpost to the secure network in my lab while the gate was active. Now.
p4706
sg4
I26
sa(dp4707
g2
V(into radio) It is much, much more than a weapon. We think we've stumbled across the Ancients' last great discovery. It was too late to win the war for them, but if I can finish the work they started\u2014
p4708
sg4
I39
sa(dp4709
g2
VIt is the ultimate power source. Something that would make zero-point modules seem like alkaline batteries in comparison.
p4710
sg4
I18
sa(dp4711
g2
VIt was called Project Arcturus, and from what we can tell, its ultimate goal was to render ZPMs obsolete.
p4712
sg4
I19
sa(dp4713
g2
VA zero-point module is an artificially created region of subspace-time. It's kind of like a miniature universe in a bottle.
p4714
sg4
I20
sa(dp4715
g2
VAnd they may have, but extracting zero-point energy from our own universe is\u2026well, it's definitely trickier.
p4716
sg4
I16
sa(dp4717
g2
VI said I wanted to do all the talking.
p4718
sg4
I9
sa(dp4719
g2
VFailure, yes. Total, no. Look, the Ancients were losing the war against the Wraith when work on Arcturus began. If they could have made it work it could have turned the tide of war. I mean, we're talking about their own Manhattan Project.
p4720
sg4
I43
sa(dp4721
g2
VYeah, but the Dorandans still inflicted massive damage on the attacking Wraith fleet.
p4722
sg4
I13
sa(dp4723
g2
VWell yes, the Ancients in the bunker were forced to shut everything down, including the weapon.
p4724
sg4
I16
sa(dp4725
g2
VDefinitely.
p4726
sg4
I1
sa(dp4727
g2
VThe Ancient scientists running Arcturus were rushed into testing before they had perfected a means of effectively controlling the power output. I believe if they'd had more time, history would've played out differently on that planet. Possibly in this galaxy.
p4728
sg4
I40
sa(dp4729
g2
VAnd desperate and losing a war they'd already been fighting for a hundred years. More importantly, they were\u2014they were, like, this close.
p4730

I22
sa(dp4731
g2
VI do.
p4732
sg4
I2
sa(dp4733
g2
VAll right, I need everyone's attention, please. What we've got here\u2026
p4734
sg4
I11
sa(dp4735
g2
VI need this code divided into sections and each one double-checked\u2026
p4736

I11
sa(dp4737
g2
VNo, you're not listening to me!
p4738
sg4
I6
sa(dp4739
g2
VI'm telling you this one right here is wrong.
p4740
sg4
I9
sa(dp4741
g2
VThe whole point here is that these numbers here need to be corrected.
p4742
sg4
I13
sa(dp4743
g2
VUnless they're corrected\u2014there you go. Simulation failed.
p4744
sg4

g2
VThat's heavy. So, I need that over there. Thank you.
p4746

g2
VI want you to pull the crystal. Pull it when I say go, all right?
p4748
sg4
I15

VEverything's been triple-checked. Power levels are holding steady in all computer simulations.
p4750

I16
sa(dp4753
g2
VRadek, talk to me.
p4754
sg4
I4
sa(dp4755

VEverything's fine. The containment bottle was designed to automatically compensate for any sudden changes in energy output.
p4756
sg4
I17
sa(dp4757
g2
VI said it's fine. Collins. See if you can boost more power to the field manually.
p4758
sg4
I16
sa(dp4759
g2
VOkay.
p4760
sg4
I1
sa(dp4761

VPrepare for test firing, on my mark.
p4762
sg4
I7
sa(dp4763
g2
VWhat?
p4764
sg4
I1
sa(dp4765
g2
VI'm trying.
p4766
sg4
I2
sa(dp4767
g2
VAll right, I've already switched to back-ups.
p4768
sg4
I7
sa(dp4769
g2
VI have given the command to shut down. Something's creating an overload.
p4770
sg4
I12
sa(dp4771
g2
VJust give me a few seconds.
p4772
sg4
I6
sa(dp4773

p4776
sg4
I1
sa(dp4777
g2
VExcuse me?
p4778
sg4
I2
sa(dp4779
g2
VNo. Collins knew the system just as well as any of us. He wouldn't have made that kind of mistake. Everything was going well, and everyone did their job.
p4780
sg4
I29
sa(dp4781
g2
VI don't know. In terms of physics, it shouldn't have happened.
p4782
sg4
I11
sa(dp4783
g2
VWhat I do know is the device did what it was supposed to do.
p4784
sg4
I14
sa(dp4785
g2
VWell, apart from the obvious containment issues\u2014
p4786
sg4
I7
sa(dp4787
g2
VBut we won't know for sure until we go back down there and try again.
p4788

sa(dp4789
g2
VYes.
p4790
sg4

p4792
sg4
I33
sa(dp4793
g2
VBut we have a responsibility to understand what happened and learn from it.
p4794
sg4
I13
sa(dp4795
g2
VWhich is why we have to go back there.
p4796
sg4

VIt's not, in this case.
p4798
sg4
I5

VHarry K. Daghlian.
p4802

I3
sa(dp4803
g2
VHe was a scientist. Worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. He was only 26 years old. Accidentally irradiated himself while performing a critical mass experiment on two half-spheres of plutonium. It took him a month to die, and while his body was slowly shutting down from radiation poisoning, you know what he did with his last thirty days? Hmm? He worked. He tried until his last breath to understand what had happened to him so that others could learn from the tragedy. So that his work, his death wouldn't be rendered meaningless.
p4804
sg4
I94
sa(dp4805
g2
VNow, have you considered what would've happened if they'd just shut the project down after that?
p4806
sg4
I16
sa(dp4807
g2
VIs it? Collins' death is a pointless waste of life unless something comes of this, and I'm not sure that I can\u2026 I think I know what happened.
p4808
sg4
I28
sa(dp4809
g2
VCan I come in?
p4810
sg4
I4
sa(dp4811
g2
VThe Ancients had it wrong. Our mistake was using their equations. Look, I just did the calculations again myself. I did them three times just to be sure, and I am positive the problem is in the automatic containment protocols.
p4812
sg4
I40
sa(dp4813
g2
VI'm proposing that we adjust the field strength manually.
p4814
sg4
I9
sa(dp4815
g2
VSo we don't operate the generator at anywhere near its potential. Look, there's no need to be greedy. Even operating at fifty percent, it'll still generate the power of a dozen ZPMs.
p4816
sg4
I32
sa(dp4817
g2
VMaybe they were caught up in the heat of battle, or maybe they thought they needed as much power as they could get. Maybe they weren't smart enough.
p4818
sg4
I28
sa(dp4819
g2
VNo, I didn't say that, but I have the benefit of hindsight, they didn't.
p4820

p4824
sg4
I5
sa(dp4825
g2
VWe tear a hole in the fabric of the universe\u2014(seeing Sheppard's alarm) Which is much less likely to happen than the Nobel Prize. I mean, look, the risks are nothing compared to the potential benefits. Elizabeth will listen to you. I've never asked this of you before, but I think I've earned it. Trust me.
p4826
sg4
I55
sa(dp4827
g2
V(very confident) I appreciate your support, Colonel, but don't worry. I try to make it a habit not to make the same mistake twice.
p4828
sg4
I24
sa(dp4829
g2
VNo. I offer you my personal assurance that a surge like the one that happened before is inconceivable.
p4830
sg4
I18
sa(dp4831
g2
VHow about I carry out my plan, and you keep the hot coffee coming? I was, uh, joking again, right? Now, where were we?
p4832

sg4
I17
sa(dp4839
g2
VWhat are you on about?
p4840
sg4
I5

VAnd as long as I'm monitoring the energy output manually, I can stop that before it happens.
p4842

g2
VI know what I'm doing.
p4844
sg4
I5
sa(dp4845

p4846
sg4
I26
sa(dp4847
g2
VCongratulations, you've solved the mystery of how the Ancients screwed up ten thousand years ago. It doesn't mean that I will do the same. Look, I don't know how else to say this, but none of you are capable of understanding this on the same level that I do. And Zelenka, that includes you.

V(to Sheppard) I won't let you down.
p4858
sg4

sa(dp4875
g2
VThere is no logical reason this shouldn't be working!
p4876

p4886

p4892
sg4
I10
sa(dp4893
g2
V(coming to a realization) Okay, we need to leave. I've waited too long. The weapon can't discharge enough power to avoid a catastrophic overload. This whole planet is going to go up.
p4894
sg4
I32
sa(dp4895
g2
VNot that your speech wasn't working.
p4896
sg4
I6
sa(dp4897
g2
VYou need to avoid flying in predictable trajectories to prevent the weapon locking onto us.
p4898
sg4
I15
sa(dp4899
g2
VI'm just saying, be sure not to fly in a straight line.
p4900
sg4
I12
sa(dp4901
g2
VCan I just say there's no way the Jumper can take even one direct hit?
p4902
sg4
I15
sa(dp4903
g2
VWeapon's locking onto us.
p4904
sg4
I4
sa(dp4905
g2
VWe can't.
p4906
sg4
I2
sa(dp4907
g2
VLook, don't you understand? This explosion is going to take out three-quarters of the solar system. There's no way we can fly far enough, fast enough. We have to head for the 'gate.
p4908
sg4
I33
sa(dp4909
g2
VHow do you intend to avoid getting hit on the final approach?
p4910
sg4
I12
sa(dp4911
g2
VI know!
p4912
sg4
I2
sa(dp4913
g2
VBut\u2014
p4914
sg4
I1
sa(dp4915
g2
VWell, five-sixths. It's not an exact science.
p4916
sg4
I7
sa(dp4917
g2
VOh, Colonel. Colonel! I've been looking all over for you.
p4918
sg4
I10
sa(dp4919
g2
VI suppose I deserve that. Look, I just, um\u2026I wanted to apologize about what happened. I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I wanted to assure you that I intend on being right again, about everything, effective immediately.
p4920
sg4
I37
sa(dp4921
g2
VThat was a joke.
p4922
sg4
I4
sa(dp4923
g2
VI've already apologized to Elizabeth.
p4924
sg4
I5
sa(dp4925
g2
VAnd Radek and\u2026and I thanked Colonel Caldwell for caring enough to spy on the experiment from orbit. Sent him a nice little e-mail, actually. But I saved you till last because, um\u2026 Honestly, I would\u2026I would hate to think that recent events might have permanently dimmed your faith in my abilities\u2026 Or your trust. At the very least, I hope I can\u2014I can earn that back.
p4926
sg4
I66
sa(dp4927
g2
V(saddened) I see.
p4928
sg4
I3
sa(dp4929
g2
VCan't say I blame them. There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
p4930
sg4
I14
sa(dp4931
g2
VI take it you don't get many strangers around here.
p4932
sg4
I10
sa(dp4933
g2
VYeah.
p4934
sg4
I1
sa(dp4935
g2
VHi. What are you talking about?
p4936
sg4
I6
sa(dp4937
g2
VAnd it is, what, some kind of an animal, or\u2026
p4938
sg4
I10
sa(dp4939
g2
VSo you have heard of them.
p4940
sg4
I6
sa(dp4941
g2
VUh, well, let's not forget the food.
p4942
sg4
I7
sa(dp4943
g2
VWhat?
p4944
sg4
I1
sa(dp4945
g2
VIt looks that way.
p4946
sg4
I4
sa(dp4947
g2
VWell, you heard wrong.
p4948
sg4
I4
sa(dp4949
g2
VHe said that, huh? Well, then, if we get rid of it, you've got nothing to worry about, you'll never have to do chores ever again.
p4950
sg4
I26
sa(dp4951
g2
VYes. Look, go away.
p4952
sg4
I4
sa(dp4953
g2
VWhat?
p4954
sg4
I1
sa(dp4955
g2
VWe're talking about a hundred square miles of forest here.
p4956
sg4
I10
sa(dp4957
g2
VAnd exactly how is he going to do that, huh?
p4958
sg4
I10
sa(dp4959
g2
VRight.
p4960
sg4
I1
sa(dp4961
g2
VCarry on.
p4962
sg4
I2
sa(dp4963
g2
VYou see it?
p4964
sg4
I3
sa(dp4965
g2
VWell, how do you know?
p4966
sg4
I5
sa(dp4967
g2
VSo you know about that, then?
p4968
sg4
I6
sa(dp4969
g2
VI'm not sure that's what I would call this, but yes.
p4970
sg4
I11
sa(dp4971
g2
VSeriously, have you seen anything like this before?
p4972
sg4
I8
sa(dp4973
g2
VWhat if it's all an act?
p4974
sg4
I6
sa(dp4975
g2
VWell, maybe the act's for his benefit, too.
p4976
sg4
I8
sa(dp4977
g2
VUh, medical research is not really my thing.
p4978
sg4
I8
sa(dp4979
g2
VBut, I mean, I can stay\u2026and help Beckett.
p4980
sg4
I8
sa(dp4981
g2
VNever could get into biology. There's just too much information about the human body. One time, I took it as an undergrad, I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions before I had to drop the class.
p4982
sg4
I39
sa(dp4983
g2
VYeah, believe it or not, back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac.
p4984
sg4
I14
sa(dp4985
g2
V(teasing) What, am I bothering you?\u2026 Maybe I'll go get some air.
p4986
sg4
I12
sa(dp4987
g2
VWe've got a problem.
p4988
sg4
I4
sa(dp4989
g2
VYeah, well, I could've, but\u2026
p4990
sg4
I5
sa(dp4991
g2
V(into radio) Sheppard, this is McKay.
p4992
sg4
I6
sa(dp4993
g2
V(into radio) The villagers are on the move, and it doesn't look like they're going to a picnic.
p4994
sg4
I18
sa(dp4995
g2
V(into radio) Not at the moment, no.
p4996
sg4
I7
sa(dp4997
g2
VWhat?
p4998
sg4
I1
sa(dp4999
g2
VLook, is there anywhere that she likes to go\u2014any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?
p5000
sg4
I15
sa(dp5001
g2
VYou know, I thought it was pretty nuts when Ronon was trying to track a Wraith through this forest.
p5002
sg4
I19
sa(dp5003
g2
VOh, yeah. Supremely confident.
p5004
sg4
I4
sa(dp5005
g2
VYou hear anything?
p5006
sg4
I3
sa(dp5007
g2
VHuh. Me neither.
p5008
sg4
I3
sa(dp5009
g2
VEasy, now. You went through the trouble to save my life. It'd be a shame to kill me.
p5010
sg4
I18
sa(dp5011
g2
V(shakily, grasping at his chest) Yeah, just peachy. What the hell was that?
p5012
sg4
I13
sa(dp5013
g2
VI guess so.
p5014
sg4
I3
sa(dp5015
g2
VOn the\u2026yeah, but\u2026
p5016
sg4
I3
sa(dp5017
g2
VZaddik!
p5018
sg4
I1
sa(dp5019
g2
VNo, no, no! You people need to go back to the village! It is not safe here.
p5020
sg4
I17
sa(dp5021
g2
VFather? I don't understand. You're\u2026you're his son?
p5022
sg4
I7
sa(dp5023
g2
VYeah, well, enjoy the ride, Colonel. They're making me walk.
p5024
sg4
I10
sa(dp5025
g2
VIt's a very nasty, painful splinter.
p5026
sg4
I6
sa(dp5027
g2
VOw! Ow.
p5028
sg4
I2
sa(dp5029
g2
VThe Ancient database has quite a lot of information about the iratus bug. We know what planet it's on, we know that it likes cool, damp, dark places to lay its eggs. It shouldn't be that hard to locate.
p5030
sg4
I39
sa(dp5031
g2
VAccording to the Ancient database, probably a cave. Cool, damp, and dark, which I translate to "scary, awful, bad."
p5032
sg4
I19
sa(dp5033
g2
VI always figured they were the predator.
p5034
sg4
I7
sa(dp5035
g2
VReally?
p5036
sg4
I1
sa(dp5037
g2
VThank you. Thank you for that.
p5038
sg4
I6
sa(dp5039
g2
VYeah, or dying.
p5040
sg4
I3
sa(dp5041
g2
VOh, well that is disgusting.
p5042
sg4
I5
sa(dp5043
g2
VAnd you had to pick it up and smell it to figure that out.
p5044
sg4
I14
sa(dp5045
g2
VWell, how recent?
p5046
sg4
I3
sa(dp5047
g2
VWell, maybe someone should, um\u2026stay out here.
p5048
sg4
I7
sa(dp5049
g2
VI'm in the middle.
p5050
sg4
I4
sa(dp5051
g2
VYeah, when they see your neck before mine, you won't think it's stupid.
p5052
sg4
I13
sa(dp5053
g2
VMaybe we should make a diversion.
p5054
sg4
I6
sa(dp5055
g2
VI'll shut up.
p5056
sg4
I3
sa(dp5057
g2
VSee? Not so stupid.
p5058
sg4
I4
sa(dp5059
g2
VOkay. We've got a lock on him.
p5060
sg4
I7
sa(dp5061
g2
VRight.
p5062
sg4
I1
sa(dp5063
g2
VI said I doubted he was lucid enough.
p5064
sg4
I8
sa(dp5065
g2
VThus stranding your search teams.
p5066
sg4
I5
sa(dp5067
g2
VBravo Team and Sheppard are in the same room.
p5068
sg4
I9
sa(dp5069
g2
VCan't sleep either?
p5070
sg4
I3
sa(dp5071
g2
V(upset) Are we really there?
p5072
sg4
I5
sa(dp5073
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I see where you're going with this. If we can artificially create the pheromone, we might be able to confuse them enough to leave us alone.
p5074
sg4
I30
sa(dp5075
g2
VWell, then that's a terrible plan, Carson.
p5076
sg4
I7
sa(dp5077
g2
VUm, I'm not sure if you've noticed or not, but Colonel Sheppard's not feeling very well.
p5078
sg4
I16
sa(dp5079
g2
VYeah, but won't giving him that much inhibitor, like\u2026
p5080
sg4
I9
sa(dp5081
g2
VNow, you realize that you may have to, uh\u2026
p5082
sg4
I9
sa(dp5083
g2
VGood to see you up and, uh\u2026about.
p5084
sg4
I7
sa(dp5085
g2
VWhat is that?
p5086
sg4
I3
sa(dp5087
g2
VAnd do what?
p5088
sg4
I3
sa(dp5089
g2
VWell done, Carson for once again elevating medicine to actual science.
p5090
sg4
I11
sa(dp5091
g2
VWell, if that's all right.
p5092
sg4
I5
sa(dp5093
g2
V(over radio) Dr. Weir?
p5094
sg4
I4
sa(dp5095
g2
V(over radio) Something you should see here.
p5096
sg4
I7
sa(dp5097
g2
VThat is the signature of an Ancient ship called the Aurora. With the ZPM now powering the city, we've been reactivating dormant systems. That one tracked the location of Ancient ships during the war.
p5098
sg4
I34
sa(dp5099
g2
VOh, see, look at his eyes, all lighting up again. It's Pavlovian. I crosschecked the logs. They were on a reconnaissance mission.
p5100
sg4
I22
sa(dp5101
g2
VWhen we activated the ZPM, the city must have sent out some kind of an automated subspace beacon, recalling ships back to Atlantis.
p5102
sg4
I23
sa(dp5103
g2
VWell, given that it's at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy\u2026 Let me see, carry the four\u2026 42 million years. Should we go wait on the porch?
p5104
sg4
I27
sa(dp5105
g2
VClever, but wrong.
p5106
sg4
I3
sa(dp5107
g2
VNot within jumper distance, no.
p5108
sg4
I5
sa(dp5109
g2
V(looking at a display) We should have visual soon.
p5110
sg4
I9
sa(dp5111
g2
VMove.
p5112
sg4
I1
sa(dp5113
g2
VOh. Looks like a small Wraith vessel.
p5114
sg4
I7
sa(dp5115
g2
VNo, bigger. Some sort of a scout ship, probably after the same thing we are.
p5116
sg4
I15
sa(dp5117
g2
VWell, all these years, the Aurora lay dormant. The signal from Atlantis woke it up, making it visible to the Wraith as well as us.
p5118
sg4
I25
sa(dp5119
g2
VStasis pods. They're still powered up.
p5120
sg4
I6
sa(dp5121
g2
VThis one's uniform is different from the others. Maybe the Captain?
p5122
sg4
I11
sa(dp5123
g2
VLife-sign indicators are active. These capsules must have some kind of a shielding. That's why the Daedalus's sensors were unable to pick them up.
p5124
sg4
I24
sa(dp5125
g2
VI'm on it.
p5126
sg4
I3
sa(dp5127
g2
VNot entirely suspended, however. The pod has slowed their aging considerably, but the bodies are virtually moribund.
p5128
sg4
I17
sa(dp5129
g2
VWell, reviving them\u2019s out of the question. The pod\u2019s the only thing keeping them alive.
p5130
sg4
I15
sa(dp5131
g2
VWait.
p5132
sg4
I1
sa(dp5133
g2
VThere's something going on. This pod is magnetically shielded. I'm reading cortical signals.
p5134
sg4
I13
sa(dp5135
g2
V(excitedly) The pod's equipped with a neural interface that's indicating definite brain activity, as though he were perfectly conscious. If all of these pods are interconnected, it's highly possible that these people are, in fact, communicating with each other.
p5136
sg4
I39
sa(dp5137
g2
VPossibly. It's their way of keeping their minds occupied until they were rescued.
p5138
sg4
I13
sa(dp5139
g2
VYeah, well, more likely, the interface was reactivated when the recall beacon from Atlantis was received. (looking at his tablet) Either way, the neuro-feedback loop is incredibly active.
p5140
sg4
I28
sa(dp5141
g2
V(sarcastically, holding up his tablet) Yes, of course. It says right here. "Why is the smart one having to stop and answer so many questions?"
p5142
sg4
I25
sa(dp5143
g2
VOf course it is. Being able to communicate with a living Ancient is the opportunity of a lifetime, but this system is a highly complex system, which I will have\u2014 Wait a minute.
p5144
sg4
I33
sa(dp5145
g2
VAnswering your question. (activating his radio) Teyla, found any more of the pods?
p5146
sg4
I13
sa(dp5147
g2
VAre any of the pods empty?
p5148
sg4
I6
sa(dp5149
g2
V(looking at a dubious Sheppard) Perfect.
p5150
sg4
I6
sa(dp5151
g2
VWhat's the matter, Colonel? Don't trust me?
p5152
sg4
I7
sa(dp5153
g2
V(snarky) Fine.
p5154
sg4
I2
sa(dp5155
g2
VI should be able to tap into the neural network without actually initializing stasis.
p5156
sg4
I14
sa(dp5157
g2
V(over radio) Look, it won't take long. I'll be in and out.
p5158
sg4
I12
sa(dp5159
g2
VLook, the quickest way to figure out what is going on in there is to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain. Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?
p5160
sg4
I35
sa(dp5161
g2
VWould I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?
p5162
sg4
I9
sa(dp5163
g2
VWhat?
p5164
sg4
I1
sa(dp5165
g2
VIt won't.
p5166
sg4
I2
sa(dp5167
g2
VIt won't! How many times do I have to say this!?
p5168
sg4
I11
sa(dp5169
g2
VWell, I've never thought of it that way, but\u2026 Hey, she's right. You should go.
p5170
sg4
I15
sa(dp5171
g2
VNow, remember, the system creates a direct feedback loop between the processor and your brainwaves. So when you want to disconnect, you'll need to, well, really concentrate.
p5172
sg4
I27
sa(dp5173
g2
VWell, I think it'll probably take a little more than that, otherwise you'd be popping in and out of the thing every time it crossed your mind.
p5174
sg4
I27
sa(dp5175
g2
VIf that works for you. Now, I should be able to monitor your EEG pattern, so in the highly unlikely event that something anomalous should present itself, I should be able to disconnect you manually.
p5176
sg4
I35
sa(dp5177
g2
VWithout permanent brain damage.
p5178
sg4
I4
sa(dp5179
g2
VWell, the opportunity to speak to a living Ancient is worth the risk, hmm? Now, when I close the lid, the pod's systems should activate. Ready?
p5180
sg4
I26
sa(dp5181
g2
VGood.
p5182
sg4
I1
sa(dp5183
g2
VSo?
p5184
sg4
I1
sa(dp5185
g2
VWell, of course it worked.
p5186
sg4
I5
sa(dp5187
g2
VWell, Caldwell sent them to search the ship's armory.
p5188
sg4
I9
sa(dp5189
g2
VNo. Unfortunately, it was depleted of drones. Look, so, what happened?
p5190
sg4
I11
sa(dp5191
g2
VWere you able to communicate with the Captain?
p5192
sg4
I8
sa(dp5193
g2
VActually, the correct term is "virtual environment."
p5194
sg4
I7
sa(dp5195
g2
VSo what did you find out?
p5196
sg4
I6
sa(dp5197
g2
VWell, did you mention that that's impossible, given that they're living in a virtual environment?
p5198
sg4
I15
sa(dp5199
g2
VWell, I would have thought that would be the first thing\u2014
p5200
sg4
I11
sa(dp5201
g2
VWhy would the pods do that?
p5202
sg4
I6
sa(dp5203
g2
VGo ahead.
p5204
sg4
I2
sa(dp5205
g2
VWhat's their E.T.A.?
p5206
sg4
I3
sa(dp5207
g2
VI've been able to decipher some more of the program. I'm actually reading neural tracking signatures of the entire crew as they make their way through the\u2014
p5208
sg4
I27
sa(dp5209
g2
VOh. Him. Uh, yeah, well, he's\u2026he\u2019s still in the pod.
p5210
sg4
I10
sa(dp5211
g2
VYes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Ticking clock. Anything else?
p5212
sg4
I9
sa(dp5213
g2
V(worried) Right.
p5214
sg4
I2
sa(dp5215
g2
V(into radio) Still here.
p5216
sg4
I4
sa(dp5217
g2
V(into radio) Can't it wait?
p5218
sg4
I5
sa(dp5219
g2
VWhat is it?
p5220
sg4
I3
sa(dp5221
g2
VThis is Wraith gear. And it's recently installed.
p5222
sg4
I8
sa(dp5223
g2
VWell, it's hard say, since you plucked us out of there the second you heard.
p5224
sg4
I15
sa(dp5225
g2
VThe Wraith's tied in to the same neuro-feedback loop as the crew and Colonel Sheppard. But by the looks of it, they must have found Aurora a long time ago, certainly long enough to figure out how to access and reconfigure the system.
p5226
sg4
I43
sa(dp5227
g2
VShe's right. We\u2019ve already determined that the range of Wraith psychic ability is limited.
p5228
sg4
I14
sa(dp5229
g2
V(emphatically) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Let's not get all trigger happy. We have no idea how much of the system this Wraith is manipulating. We need to figure out what is going on before we start shooting things. For all we know, that could kill Sheppard.
p5230
sg4
I47
sa(dp5231
g2
VHe can come out any time he wants. There must be a good reason.
p5232

VNo\u2026 I don't think so. I don't know, but I should get back in there and learn what this Wraith is doing.
p5234
sg4
I22
sa(dp5235
g2
VFifteen? Where do you people come up with these arbitrary numbers!?
p5236
sg4
I11
sa(dp5237
g2
VWhy?
p5238
sg4
I1
sa(dp5239
g2
V(meekly) Okay.
p5240
sg4
I2
sa(dp5241
g2
VDelta waves.
p5242
sg4
I2
sa(dp5243
g2
VIt hasn't even been five minutes!
p5244
sg4
I6
sa(dp5245
g2
VColonel Sheppard's EEG frequencies are decreasing. I'm reading delta waves, which indicates that he's unconscious within the virtual environment. I'm not sure how it happened, but something is definitely wrong in there.
p5246
sg4
I32
sa(dp5247
g2
VThat would be a mistake. Look, additional data I've been able to decipher from the Wraith's biometrics receiver shows significant manipulation of the feedback loop. Something we were clearly not aware of when Sheppard went in.
p5248
sg4
I36
sa(dp5249
g2
VColonel, this Wraith is controlling the program, which means it might have booby-trapped it as well. We're talking about Sheppard's life here.
p5250
sg4
I22
sa(dp5251
g2
VI'm going in.
p5252
sg4
I3
sa(dp5253
g2
VLook, stall Caldwell. Buy me some time \u2014 just a few minutes at the most.
p5254
sg4
I15
sa(dp5255
g2
VYou see, the thing is, Colonel Sheppard and I have sort of gotten into this habit of saving each other's lives, and it's my turn.
p5256
sg4
I25
sa(dp5257
g2
VIt can be your turn next. Look\u2026
p5258
sg4
I7
sa(dp5259
g2
VHit this to manually disconnect me. If I do not regain consciousness, go ahead and open Colonel Sheppard's pod. Have us beamed directly to Daedalus and make sure they have a medical team waiting.
p5260
sg4
I34
sa(dp5261
g2
V(nervously) I'm sure I don't.
p5262
sg4
I5
sa(dp5263
g2
V(speaking quickly) Okay\u2026 All right. Looks like there's more than enough air in here. Right. Of course there is. Crew's been sealed inside these things for thousands of years\u2026
p5264
sg4
I29
sa(dp5265
g2
VYeah. It's just my claustrophobia. I'll be fine\u2026 I hope. Now, the system should engage once you send me in.
p5266
sg4
I20
sa(dp5267
g2
VAll right\u2026 So send me in?
p5268
sg4
I6
sa(dp5269
g2
VRight.
p5270
sg4
I1
sa(dp5271
g2
VWhere are you taking me? I told you, I'm with Colonel Sheppard. I'm a member of his team. Colonel John Sheppard, he's about so high, brown hair, a bit mussed. The term is "rakish." Oh, for\u2014
p5272
sg4
I36
sa(dp5273
g2
VWhat are you doing in there?
p5274
sg4
I6
sa(dp5275
g2
VI came to help you.
p5276
sg4
I5
sa(dp5277
g2
VHave you been unable to disconnect yourself from the system?
p5278
sg4
I10
sa(dp5279
g2
VOh, good. We thought maybe it was preventing you from exiting the program.
p5280
sg4
I13
sa(dp5281
g2
VWe found a Wraith in one of the stasis pods. It's manipulating the neurofeedback program. Your EEG patterns were irregular\u2014
p5282
sg4
I20
sa(dp5283
g2
VI didn't want to risk pulling you out until I knew more.
p5284
sg4
I12
sa(dp5285
g2
VWhat about him?
p5286
sg4
I3
sa(dp5287
g2
VThe Wraith we found was male. The First Officer must have been female. It took her place.
p5288
sg4
I17
sa(dp5289
g2
VWell, we don't need the Captain. I've been able to decipher enough of the program to overwrite the protocols. All I have to do is get to a terminal within the virtual environment, and I should be able to access any file stored within the database.
p5290
sg4
I46
sa(dp5291
g2
VHold that thought.
p5292
sg4
I3
sa(dp5293
g2
VGive me the tablet. The data device, right here, right here. Thank you. That's it.
p5294
sg4
I15
sa(dp5295
g2
VJust keep stalling, keep stalling.
p5296
sg4
I5
sa(dp5297
g2
VHi.
p5298
sg4
I1
sa(dp5299
g2
VIt should be the next hallway.
p5300
sg4
I6
sa(dp5301
g2
VThat's the Wraith?
p5302
sg4
I3
sa(dp5303
g2
VWow. She's hot. I mean, seriously hot.
p5304
sg4
I7
sa(dp5305
g2
VI know. I disgust myself sometimes.
p5306
sg4
I6
sa(dp5307
g2
VThe communiqu has been erased.
p5308
sg4
I5
sa(dp5309
g2
V(sarcasticallyWell, it says right here. "I, the Wraith, delete this important information to keep you from seeing it."
p5310
sg4
I18
sa(dp5311
g2
VOh, no.
p5312
sg4
I2
sa(dp5313
g2
VYou said they were trying to modify the hyperdrive.
p5314
sg4
I9
sa(dp5315
g2
VWell, according to the Atlantis database, there are two different types of Ancient hyperdrives. There's the more basic, interstellar kind, like the one the Aurora has, and then there's the more powerful, intergalactic kind similar to the one the Asgard provided us for the Daedalus.
p5316
sg4
I45
sa(dp5317
g2
VBecause the Wraith hyperdrives are nowhere near as advanced as the Ancient hyperdrives. With all of the technology the Captain is feeding her right now\u2014
p5318
sg4
I25
sa(dp5319
g2
VThat means they'll make it as far as Earth.
p5320
sg4
I9
sa(dp5321
g2
VEven if she doesn't have all the information she needs, we need to stop her from sending what she's learned so far to the Wraith ships that are on the way.
p5322
sg4
I31
sa(dp5323
g2
VI'm- I'm sure I mentioned that.
p5324
sg4
I6
sa(dp5325
g2
VWell, it-it threw me when she was so hot.
p5326
sg4
I9
sa(dp5327
g2
VTwo cruisers.
p5328
sg4
I2
sa(dp5329
g2
VHim. Not from the inside, no. But I should be able to disable the pod interface from the outside.
p5330
sg4
I19
sa(dp5331
g2
VBecause I didn't know what that would do to you.
p5332
sg4
I10
sa(dp5333
g2
VYou told her?
p5334
sg4
I3
sa(dp5335
g2
VWhy?
p5336
sg4
I1
sa(dp5337
g2
VThe communiqu is blank.
p5338
sg4
I4
sa(dp5339
g2
V(sheepishly) Only that Caldwell is probably going to destroy this ship at any moment.
p5340
sg4
I14
sa(dp5341
g2
VGoing.
p5342
sg4
I1
sa(dp5343
g2
VTeyla? Ronon? Oh, I can't believe it. Two minutes in the pod, I'm abandoned. Come on. (struggling to get up) Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh\u2026 Right. Okay.
p5344
sg4
I31
sa(dp5345
g2
VCome on\u2026 Disable.
p5346
sg4
I3
sa(dp5347
g2
VHa!
p5348
sg4
I1
sa(dp5349
g2
VOh, no.
p5350
sg4
I2
sa(dp5351
g2
VCome on, come on\u2026
p5352
sg4
I4
sa(dp5353
g2
VIt's about damn time. What'd you do, play a round of golf?
p5354
sg4
I12
sa(dp5355
g2
VWe've got serious problems.
p5356
sg4
I4
sa(dp5357
g2
VThat happened. Not so hot now.
p5358
sg4
I6
sa(dp5359
g2
VNo, no, no. We need to get far away.
p5360
sg4
I9
sa(dp5361
g2
VWe monitored all transmissions from the Wraith cruisers prior to the explosion. They never got a chance to board the Aurora or upload any of the Ancient information.
p5362
sg4
I28
sa(dp5363
g2
VThank you.
p5364
sg4
I2
sa(dp5365
g2
VThey couldn't have. Even if they somehow deduced the location of Earth, they still wouldn't be able to get there, not unless they\u2026 They downloaded something along with the hive ship plans, something like spyware. It's like when I stupidly downloaded por\u2014Music. When I downloaded music. I asked them to do it. I did this. I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
p5366
sg4
I64
sa(dp5367
g2
VThank you. Thank you so much for that!
p5368
sg4
I8
sa(dp5369
g2
VFocus on what? What is there to focus on? I'm stuck in a cocoon.
p5370
sg4
I14
sa(dp5371
g2
VOh, right. Of course. Now, why didn't I think of that? Of course. Here goes. Um, nope. Still can't move. I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof, there, big guy.
p5372
sg4
I28
sa(dp5373
g2
VThere is no reason to believe that their hyperspace field is any different from ours, and we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus while in hyperspace.
p5374
sg4
I26
sa(dp5375
g2
VHe's not listening.
p5376
sg4
I3
sa(dp5377
g2
VYou know, these things are actually quite comfortable. Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine\u2026 I suppose they're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity as we know it.
p5378
sg4
I36
sa(dp5379
g2
VOkay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out? Then what, huh? We're still on a hive, we're still traveling through hyperspace, probably in the massive void between our two galaxies\u2026where there aren't even planets, let alone Stargates. What then, huh? Do we fly home on the wings of imagination? Is that what we do, Ronon?
p5380
sg4
I64
sa(dp5381
g2
VOh, fine. I will.
p5382
sg4
I4
sa(dp5383
g2
VI wonder what they'll do to us. Feed on us, probably. I mean, that's\u2026 That's what they do.
p5384
sg4
I18
sa(dp5385
g2
VMaybe. Earth'll probably mount some kind of defense, in which case, I imagine death would be instantaneous. Unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something. Then we'd be burned alive. Well, burned alive or suffocate. I wonder which would be worse, being life-sucked by the Wraith or burned alive. I honestly couldn't consider two worse options.
p5386
sg4
I59
sa(dp5387
g2
VOkay, you know what? Make me.
p5388
sg4
I6
sa(dp5389
g2
VWhat are you doing? Where did you get that?
p5390
sg4
I9
sa(dp5391
g2
VWould it have killed you to tell me?
p5392
sg4
I8
sa(dp5393
g2
VWhat? Don't just stand there. Cut me loose.
p5394
sg4
I8
sa(dp5395
g2
VWell, now there is hope!
p5396
sg4
I5
sa(dp5397
g2
VNo!
p5398
sg4

sa(dp5399
g2
VGod, a little help, please? Oh, it's freezing out here!
p5400
sg4
I10

VNo.
p5402
sg4
I1
sa(dp5403
g2
VWhat?
p5404
sg4
I1
sa(dp5405
g2
VWell, I don't\u2026
p5406
sg4
I3
sa(dp5407
g2
VYou said no more death talk.
p5408
sg4
I6
sa(dp5409
g2
VLook, fine, we're out of the cocoons. So what? We're still stuck on the ship, and there's no way off it without\u2026 Well, in any survivable way.
p5410
sg4
I27
sa(dp5411
g2
VIt's not a question of thinking.
p5412
sg4
I6
sa(dp5413
g2
VFine. Can we at least go somewhere else? Can you get this off me? It's down my back. It's down my back.
p5414
sg4
I22
sa(dp5415
g2
VWe have been walking around here for the better part of a day, and I haven't seen one exit sign. Look, sooner or later, I'm going to have to eat something.
p5416
sg4
I31
sa(dp5417
g2
VYou? Really?
p5418
sg4
I2
sa(dp5419
g2
VOh, maybe. Why?
p5420
sg4
I3
sa(dp5421
g2
VWhat do you mean?
p5422
sg4
I4
sa(dp5423
g2
VHow is that an escape plan?
p5424
sg4
I6
sa(dp5425
g2
V(incensed) How is it a plan?
p5426
sg4
I6
sa(dp5427
g2
V(resigned) I suppose I'd rather die as a hero than as a meal.
p5428
sg4
I13
sa(dp5429
g2
VYeah, probably.
p5430
sg4
I2
sa(dp5431
g2
VWhat the hell?
p5432
sg4
I3
sa(dp5433
g2
VWith who?
p5434
sg4
I2
sa(dp5435
g2
VWell, it matters to us.
p5436
sg4
I5
sa(dp5437
g2
VBecause if it's our guys, then our chances of survival just went back above zero, albeit fractionally.
p5438
sg4
I17
sa(dp5439
g2
VTheir operating system is a mess. Thank goodness I remembered DOS. Trust me, that was hilarious.
p5440
sg4
I16
sa(dp5441
g2
VLook, this ship has been seriously damaged. It's hard for me to find something to overload.
p5442
sg4
I16
sa(dp5443
g2
VWhere did you come from?
p5444
sg4
I5
sa(dp5445
g2
VThe Daedalus\u2014the Daedalus is here?
p5446
sg4
I5
sa(dp5447
g2
VBesides, I don't think that's even possible. It took me days to crack theWraith dart interface, and this ship is a whole lot bigger.
p5448
sg4
I24
sa(dp5449
g2
VWell, I could try.
p5450
sg4
I4
sa(dp5451
g2
VOh, great. The day just gets better and better.
p5452
sg4
I9
sa(dp5453
g2
VMeaning that in a little under nine hours, we're all going to suffocate.
p5454
sg4
I13
sa(dp5455
g2
VBy the time we got something like that up and running, the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we'd be able to concoct.
p5456
sg4
I24
sa(dp5457
g2
VYes, yeah, but regardless, we need more electricians and welders than are technically certified on the ship's roster. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
p5458
sg4
I31
sa(dp5459
g2
VGood, good.
p5460
sg4
I2
sa(dp5461
g2
VAh, now we're talking. How many more of these do we have?
p5462
sg4
I12
sa(dp5463
g2
VHow many people on board?
p5464
sg4
I5
sa(dp5465
g2
VOh, so, I guess buddy-breathing our way through this one's out of the question.
p5466
sg4
I14
sa(dp5467
g2
VOkay, fine they're reserved for people working on getting life-support systems operational. We need those people as clear-headed as possible.
p5468
sg4
I20
sa(dp5469
g2
VYes, I will be one of them.
p5470
sg4
I7
sa(dp5471
g2
VWe can't exactly transfer the Oh-two where we need it.
p5472
sg4
I10
sa(dp5473
g2
VWe will be able to access key panels that have been closed off to us. Let's get Sheppard in a 302. He can eyeball it from the outside. I'll take this.
p5474
sg4
I31
sa(dp5475
g2
VThe space suits were stored in those sections.
p5476
sg4
I8
sa(dp5477
g2
VCopy that.
p5478
sg4
I2
sa(dp5479
g2
VYes, yes, yes. We have tried everything.
p5480
sg4
I7
sa(dp5481
g2
V(shakily) We are floating between two galaxies, Radek. Atlantis has no ship to send, and even if we were somehow able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth, it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
p5482
sg4
I43
sa(dp5483
g2
VWell, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air. (inspired) Wait a second.
p5484
sg4
I23
sa(dp5485
g2
VThe only breathable air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
p5486
sg4
I12
sa(dp5487
g2
VYes, yes, yes. That could work.
p5488
sg4
I6
sa(dp5489
g2
VWe finish the plan we started.
p5490
sg4
I6
sa(dp5491
g2
VBecause they'll be humans with no memories. I can't believe I might actually survive this.
p5492
sg4
I15
sa(dp5493
g2
VThe queen's chamber should be that way.
p5494
sg4
I7
sa(dp5495
g2
VOh. Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
p5496
sg4
I9
sa(dp5497
g2
VI only thought of it now.
p5498
sg4
I6
sa(dp5499
g2
VSo, I'm in Atlantis, and I need to get to Earth. What do I do? Since we no longer have access to a ZPM due to\u2026unforeseeable circumstances, my only option would be to call the Daedalus and spend the next three weeks twiddling my thumbs waiting to get back home\u2026until now.  I give you the McKay-Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge. Thirty-four gates from both the Milky Way and Pegasus gate systems have been strategically placed in the massive void between our two galaxies. Simply enter on either side\u2014for example, Atlantis\u2014and boom! A macro that, uh, I have written especially for the occasion will command each Gate in the chain to store you in its buffer and forward you along to the next and the next, and the next, and the next, and the next, until you arrive\u2026here.
p5500
sg4
I136
sa(dp5501
g2
V(continuing) Once at the mid-way space station, you simply exit the Pegasus gate system, and enter the Milky Way gate system, where a similar macro, designed by yours truly, will forward you along to the SGC. Total travel time, a little over thirty minutes. Cue applause.
p5502
sg4
I46
sa(dp5503
g2
V(signaling) Thank you. Enough.
p5504
sg4
I4
sa(dp5505
g2
VThe mid-way space station isn't completed yet, so we will be testing the system today using a puddle jumper. Now the\u2026
p5506
sg4
I21
sa(dp5507
g2
VRight.
p5508
sg4
I1
sa(dp5509
g2
V(reading his notepad computer) All systems seem to be\u2026huh.
p5510
sg4
I9
sa(dp5511
g2
V(distractedly) Oh, there's an odd echo on the proximity sensors. It won't affect the test, but, uh\u2026Yeah, we're-we're ready to go.
p5512
sg4
I21
sa(dp5513
g2
VWe have a contact!
p5514
sg4
I4
sa(dp5515
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no, no. This is weird.
p5516
sg4
I9
sa(dp5517
g2
VNo, no, no. It's, uh, nothing to do with the, uh, the test. It's just our, uh, sensors are not working properly.
p5518
sg4
I22
sa(dp5519
g2
V(distracted) Mm. Mm. Yeah-yeah-yeah. I'm sure he's fine.
p5520
sg4
I8
sa(dp5521
g2
V(more focused) Uh, he's good to go. Good to go. Yes. Go ahead.

I13
sa(dp5523
g2
VJumper is away.
p5524
sg4
I3
sa(dp5525
g2
V(still studying his computer) Yes, of course it worked. I'm already onto the next problem.
p5526
sg4
I15
sa(dp5527
g2
VWell, the, uh sensors are having a hard time determining what it is. Probably due to the Doppler effect.
p5528
sg4
I19
sa(dp5529
g2
VI'm detecting a foreign object travelling at .999 the speed of light, and it's coming this way.
p5530
sg4
I17
sa(dp5531
g2
VBelieve it or not, moving that fast, while an incredible feat of technology, isn't very useful. Certainly in comparison to travel through hyperspace. Now, moving as fast as it is, this ship\u2014assuming it is a ship\u2014would still take at least a million years just to reach the Milky Way.
p5532
sg4
I49
sa(dp5533
g2
VExactly. The people on board\u2014assuming that they are people\u2014would only experience, maybe\u2026twelve years? So a few stasis chambers, they're laughing\u2026well, they're not laughing, they're unconscious, but you know, metaphorically\u2026
p5534
sg4
I29
sa(dp5535
g2
VAh, well, we try and make contact, obviously.
p5536
sg4
I8
sa(dp5537
g2
VWell we can't. I mean even if we succeeded, we'd be subject to the same time dilation effects. We'd be out of contact with Earth and Atlantis for, what, years.
p5538
sg4
I30
sa(dp5539
g2
VYes, but they would blow right past us as soon as we dropped back into normal space, because our "sublight" engines aren't capable of accelerating to anywhere near the speed of light.

g2
VHmm. Yes. I mean, that-that might work. Um, we should at least be able to stay in range enough to get some sensor readings. Yeah.
p5542
sg4
I25
sa(dp5543
g2
VUm, did you really get pizza for everyone? Because it would be a shame for that to go to waste if we're really gonna um\u2026
p5544
sg4
I25
sa(dp5545
g2
V(abashed) Yeah, okay, so solve this first, and then\u2026
p5546
sg4
I9
sa(dp5547
g2
VThey're gonna fly by us in three\u2026two\u2026one\u2026
p5548
sg4
I7
sa(dp5549
g2
VInteresting.
p5550
sg4
I1
sa(dp5551
g2
VIf these readings are correct, and, to be perfectly fair they may not be\u2026
p5552
sg4
I14
sa(dp5553
g2
VIt's an Ancient warship. It's possibly Aurora class.
p5554
sg4
I8
sa(dp5555
g2
VI would imagine Ancients?
p5556
sg4
I4
sa(dp5557
g2
V(disgusted) Relativity! Look, remember, for them only handful of years have passed.
p5558
sg4
I12
sa(dp5559
g2
VWell, maybe their hyperdrive was damaged in the battle with the Wraith. It happens with us all the time. I mean, it, uh, it conked out on the way, and they were forced to continue at as close to light speed as possible. That would explain how they got a million light years away from Pegasus without having to leave a million years ago.
p5560
sg4
I64
sa(dp5561
g2
VWell, maybe they have a ZPM.
p5562
sg4
I6
sa(dp5563
g2
VOkay, we need to send them a message before they get out of range, and we have to jump ahead. Something like, uh, you know, we are humans from Earth, currently occupying Atlantis, yadda yadda yadda.
p5564
sg4
I36
sa(dp5565
g2
V(leaning in to read the monitors) No, they saw us. And they're not just slowing down. I mean, they're slamming on the brakes at something like twenty-seven Gs.
p5566
sg4
I28
sa(dp5567
g2
VWell, yes! Yes, of course we will.
p5568
sg4
I7
sa(dp5569
g2
V(ecstatic) We're gonna meet Ancients! I mean\u2026flesh and-and blood Ancients who know what everything is and how everything works. I mean, I don't even know what to ask first!
p5570
sg4
I29
sa(dp5571
g2
VRight. Right.
p5572
sg4
I2
sa(dp5573
g2
V(flabbergasted) What is that? How come I've never seen that?
p5574
sg4
I10
sa(dp5575
g2
VYou should be in there.
p5576
sg4
I5
sa(dp5577
g2
VBut why? There may be a hundred or so of them? I mean, they could use us, they might even need us.
p5578
sg4
I22
sa(dp5579
g2
V(squirming uncomfortably) I'd be fine with that.
p5580
sg4
I7
sa(dp5581
g2
VWhat? That's it? We're just gonna take this lying down? We rescued them!
p5582
sg4
I13
sa(dp5583
g2
VYeah, well, they're not showing it!
p5584
sg4
I6
sa(dp5585
g2
VWell, did you remind them if we hadn't hunted and gathered them out of the void between galaxies, they would still be stuck there?!
p5586
sg4
I24
sa(dp5587
g2
VI don't know. Area 51, I guess. Tool around with as much of the database as we're able to bring back with us.
p5588
sg4
I23
sa(dp5589
g2
VEh, I suppose so. I just don't know how many times I'm gonna be asked to, uh, "save the day at the eleventh hour" at Area 51.
p5590
sg4
I27
sa(dp5591
g2
VYeah, not as often as I'd like.
p5592
sg4
I7
sa(dp5593
g2
VYou are not tearing up on me, are you? Oh he is, he's tearing up.
p5594
sg4
I15
sa(dp5595
g2
V(insincerely) Oh, I'm sorry.
p5596
sg4
I4
sa(dp5597
g2
VWell, it's not like we not gonna see each other at the 'gate!
p5598
sg4
I13
sa(dp5599
g2
V(calling after him) What was it?
p5600
sg4
I6
sa(dp5601
g2
VWhat you were going to say. Just say it. Now I'm curious.
p5602
sg4
I12
sa(dp5603
g2
VGrounding station on the south pier's a bit twitchy. It got shot up. Wasn't our fault. You need to look at that.
p5604
sg4
I22
sa(dp5605
g2
VNo, I'm sure you will, but um, you should also, uh\u2026
p5606
sg4
I11
sa(dp5607
g2
VUh, right. Yes, well\u2026I gotta go.
p5608
sg4
I6
sa(dp5609
g2
V(to Teyla) Bye. (to others) Hi.
p5610
sg4
I6
sa(dp5611
g2
V(over phone) I hate it here.
p5612
sg4
I6
sa(dp5613
g2
VIt's true!
p5614
sg4
I2
sa(dp5615
g2
VYeah, it's too big.
p5616
sg4
I4
sa(dp5617
g2
VYeah, sycophants, every one of them.
p5618
sg4
I6
sa(dp5619
g2
VWell, that's not true.
p5620
sg4
I4
sa(dp5621
g2
V(sighing) You know, the truth is, I\u2026
p5622
sg4
I7
sa(dp5623
g2
VYeah, I don't-I don't want to use the term "lonely," But, uh, there are certain people who\u2026I miss.
p5624
sg4
I18
sa(dp5625
g2
V(scoffing) You?! You I'm talking with on the phone right now and having dinner with tomorrow, so, not so much. But other people, people who I may never see again\u2026like even Elizabeth. She doesn't return any of my calls.
p5626
sg4
I39
sa(dp5627
g2
V(sighing again) Hey, at least you still get to go off-world with a team of your own.
p5628
sg4
I17
sa(dp5629
g2
VYeah, wouldn't miss it. Hey, you know I\u2026
p5630
sg4
I8
sa(dp5631
g2
VYeah.
p5632
sg4
I1
sa(dp5633
g2
V(agreeing) Hmm.
p5634
sg4
I2
sa(dp5635
g2
VOh, I thought we made a solemn vow never to speak of that again.
p5636
sg4
I14
sa(dp5637
g2
V(into phone) McKay.
p5638
sg4
I3
sa(dp5639
g2
VIt is\u2026remotely possible that in trying to rewrite Niam's base code, I\u2014we may have opened the door for them to make other changes?
p5640
sg4
I23
sa(dp5641
g2
VAnd we have an iris.
p5642
sg4
I5
sa(dp5643
g2
VYeah, but those macros are very complicated.
p5644
sg4
I7
sa(dp5645
g2
VAnti-replicator weapons.
p5646
sg4
I2
sa(dp5647
g2
VThey're energy weapons. They disrupt the link between the nanite cells. The Replicators literally fall apart when you fire on them.
p5648
sg4
I21
sa(dp5649
g2
VWell, I did write a backdoor to the shield program. Couple years ago when Kolya stormed the city? So, I mean, it could "hypothetically" let us get into the Gate Room.
p5650
sg4
I31
sa(dp5651
g2
V(inspired) We'd need a jumper!
p5652
sg4
I5
sa(dp5653
g2
VHmm.
p5654
sg4
I1
sa(dp5655
g2
VThe jumper is in its storage area under guard. We need for one of us to be added to the authorized personnel list, and there's only one guy who can do that.
p5656
sg4
I32
sa(dp5657
g2
V(confused) No. Why'd you think I was going to say me?
p5658
sg4
I11
sa(dp5659
g2
VNo, sadly, Dr. Lee's been the one heading up the jumper research project because they refuse to send it to Area 51 for me. But, um, I think I should be able to able to add one of our key cards to the authorized personnel list, but, um, I have to do that from his office.
p5660
sg4
I56
sa(dp5661
g2
VWell, he's in his office. So you need to distract him.
p5662
sg4
I11
sa(dp5663
g2
VWell, here's what I'm thinking\u2026
p5664
sg4
I5
sa(dp5665
g2
V(loudly) Wow! Will you look at the time. Where does it go, huh?
p5666
sg4
I13
sa(dp5667
g2
VUh, we're late, we should\u2026um, book. We'll see you, Bill!
p5668
sg4
I10
sa(dp5669
g2
VYou set?
p5670
sg4
I2
sa(dp5671
g2
VOkay, they're going to be able to get through my hack pretty quickly.
p5672
sg4
I13
sa(dp5673
g2
VOh trust me, I am going as fast as I can.
p5674
sg4
I11
sa(dp5675
g2
VNope.
p5676
sg4
I1
sa(dp5677
g2
VOkay! Okay, I've got it.
p5678
sg4
I5
sa(dp5679
g2
VThey emit a directional energy beam that disrupts the connection between nanites.
p5680
sg4
I12
sa(dp5681
g2
VEr, yes. They work good.
p5682
sg4
I5
sa(dp5683
g2
VOkay, I think I've loaded up the GDO. It'll lower the shield when we dial.
p5684
sg4
I15
sa(dp5685
g2
VAll right. Dialing Atlantis.
p5686
sg4
I4
sa(dp5687
g2
VAnd\u2026
p5688
sg4
I1
sa(dp5689
g2
VThat's confirmation. Gate shield has been lowered.
p5690
sg4
I7
sa(dp5691
g2
VYeah, you and me both.
p5692
sg4
I5
sa(dp5693
g2
VThat's confirmation. The Gate shield is lowered.
p5694
sg4
I7
sa(dp5695
g2
VYeah, you and me both.
p5696
sg4
I5
sa(dp5697
g2
VPackage is away.
p5698
sg4
I3
sa(dp5699
g2
VIt's good to be back, however briefly.
p5700
sg4
I7
sa(dp5701
g2
VWell, that is gonna be easier said than done. With all those hits we took, it's gonna be impossible for me to convert the shield back to a cloak.
p5702
sg4
I29
sa(dp5703
g2
VI mean "not possible". What do you think I mean?
p5704
sg4
I10
sa(dp5705
g2
V(shrugging) Who knows? A couple of hours?
p5706
sg4
I7
sa(dp5707
g2
V(inspired) If we time this right, this could work to our advantage.
p5708
sg4
I12
sa(dp5709
g2
VThat's him.
p5710
sg4
I2
sa(dp5711
g2
VTrue. His power levels are barely registering. It's no wonder the Replicators didn't find him.
p5712
sg4
I15
sa(dp5713
g2
VHe's mostly dead. Besides, we don't have a choice. He's the key to our whole plan.
p5714
sg4
I16
sa(dp5715
g2
VOkay, okay.
p5716
sg4
I2
sa(dp5717
g2
VOkay. Okay, this is good. His power levels are minimal but not too minimal. I'm fairly sure he doesn't have the juice to regain consciousness.
p5718
sg4
I25
sa(dp5719
g2
VWh-whoa!
p5720
sg4
I1
sa(dp5721
g2
VI was fairly sure.
p5722
sg4
I4
sa(dp5723
g2
VI think we're good to go.
p5724
sg4
I6
sa(dp5725
g2
VDo what from here?
p5726
sg4
I4
sa(dp5727
g2
VOf course I remember the plan. It's my plan.
p5728
sg4
I9
sa(dp5729
g2
VIt was mostly my plan. (muttering petulantly) It was my freezing program.
p5730
sg4
I12
sa(dp5731
g2
VBecause I've gotta keep Niam at nominal power levels, otherwise we risk him waking up. Look, low power means short range. Short range means we need to get closer.
p5732
sg4
I29
sa(dp5733
g2
VMuch.
p5734
sg4
I1
sa(dp5735
g2
VNo cloak.
p5736
sg4
I2
sa(dp5737
g2
VOkay, I'll start broadcasting the virus now, but, uh, we're gonna need to get closer than that.
p5738
sg4
I17
sa(dp5739
g2
VWe're still not close enough.
p5740
sg4
I5
sa(dp5741
g2
VIt should be working.
p5742
sg4
I4
sa(dp5743
g2
VWell, if I give him any more power, he'll wake up and kill us all!
p5744
sg4
I15
sa(dp5745
g2
VOkay, ready to open the lock.
p5746
sg4
I6
sa(dp5747
g2
VOkay, closing the outer door. Yes. Now, I just have to pressurize the compartment and we are\u2026
p5748
sg4
I17
sa(dp5749
g2
VHuh?
p5750
sg4
I1
sa(dp5751
g2
VIt's not letting me do it.
p5752
sg4
I6
sa(dp5753
g2
VYeah, excellent observation, thank you.
p5754
sg4
I5
sa(dp5755
g2
VOh, not again.
p5756
sg4
I3
sa(dp5757
g2
V(panicking) I just want to point out that this was not my idea.
p5758
sg4
I13
sa(dp5759
g2
VAnd yet, no cigar!
p5760
sg4
I4
sa(dp5761
g2
VRight.
p5762
sg4
I1
sa(dp5763
g2
VOh\u2026dear.
p5764
sg4
I1
sa(dp5765
g2
VI don't think I'm gonna be able to open the outer door.
p5766
sg4
I12
sa(dp5767
g2
VI think it might be jammed.
p5768
sg4
I6
sa(dp5769
g2
VOkay, "is".
p5770
sg4
I2
sa(dp5771
g2
VYeah, I'd have to agree with you on that.
p5772
sg4
I9
sa(dp5773
g2
VIn the bay's control room, yes.
p5774
sg4
I6
sa(dp5775
g2
V\u2026which is sealed from the other side.
p5776
sg4
I7
sa(dp5777
g2
VGood. Okay, give me half an hour to get Niam to the right power level, so we can do this.
p5778
sg4
I20
sa(dp5779
g2
V(over radio) Okay, there should be a hatch leading down to the next level. Do you see it?
p5780
sg4
I18
sa(dp5781
g2
VThe Control Room should be almost directly below.
p5782
sg4
I8
sa(dp5783
g2
VWhat's that?
p5784
sg4
I2
sa(dp5785
g2
VAh. I, uh, couldn't convince you to take a swim today, could I?
p5786
sg4
I13
sa(dp5787
g2
VIt's a manual override. It should be in the center of the console. It'll be obvious once you get in there.
p5788
sg4
I21
sa(dp5789
g2
V(over radio) Did you do it?
p5790
sg4
I6
sa(dp5791
g2
VWell, I've never seen it before!
p5792
sg4
I6
sa(dp5793
g2
VWell, it's an emergency control. It should be among the most prominent.
p5794
sg4
I12
sa(dp5795
g2
V(over radio) General. It sounded like you had the right control. Why did you stop?
p5796
sg4
I15
sa(dp5797
g2
V(into radio) I had no idea.
p5798
sg4
I6
sa(dp5799
g2
VHe's doing it! He's almost got it!
p5800
sg4
I7
sa(dp5801
g2
V(over radio) Tell him, like, thirty more seconds and we're \u2026
p5802
sg4
I11
sa(dp5803
g2
V(into radio) Woolsey? Woolsey, come in.
p5804
sg4
I6
sa(dp5805
g2
VI am working as fast as I can.
p5806
sg4
I8
sa(dp5807
g2
VUnfortunately, that information can't make me work any faster.
p5808
sg4
I9
sa(dp5809
g2
VOkay, if I\u2026that should\u2026 Yeah. Okay, yes. Stand by. (into radio) I've got his power levels about as high as I'm comfortable with. I'm gonna try to get him to \u2026
p5810
sg4
I31
sa(dp5811
g2
V(panicked) Fall back to the Jumper! We're gonna need a new plan.
p5812
sg4
I12
sa(dp5813
g2
VWhich is how they were able to reactivate Niam, which pretty much screws Plan A.
p5814
sg4
I15
sa(dp5815
g2
VNo. I need to load the program directly into a Replicator and spread it that way.
p5816
sg4
I16
sa(dp5817
g2
VWell, normally I would share your run-and-gun enthusiasm, but these weapons are only gonna work for so long before they manage to identify the frequency they use to disrupt the bonds that hold the Replicators together.
p5818
sg4
I36
sa(dp5819
g2
VExactly. Look, the freezing plan would have worked because they would be unable to communicate with each other while we were blasting them, but the more we shoot, the greater the likelihood these weapons are gonna become ineffective.
p5820
sg4
I38
sa(dp5821
g2
V(snapping his fingers) C-4. How much do we have?
p5822
sg4
I9
sa(dp5823
g2
VWell, it's desperate\u2026
p5824
sg4
I3
sa(dp5825
g2
VWe need to split into groups.
p5826
sg4
I6
sa(dp5827
g2
VOh, hey! No problem.
p5828
sg4
I4
sa(dp5829
g2
V(contrite) Oh! Uh, right. Thanks. Should have you outta there in no time. This won't take long at all. (His face falls.) Oh, my. They've changed the codes.
p5830
sg4
I28
sa(dp5831
g2
VYeah, of course I can. Just give me like one\u2026two seconds.
p5832
sg4
I11
sa(dp5833
g2
VYeah, not-not so much.
p5834
sg4
I4
sa(dp5835
g2
VActually, it's more like Plan C. "C" as in C-4, if you catch my drift.
p5836
sg4
I15
sa(dp5837
g2
VLet's just say that we're concerned the Daedalus won't be able to carry out your standing orders.
p5838
sg4
I17
sa(dp5839
g2
VYeah, it's the only way.
p5840
sg4
I5
sa(dp5841
g2
VYeah. If we plant charges in all ten of the shield emitters before the Daedalus arrives, that way when the Replicators try to activate the shield\u2026
p5842
sg4
I26
sa(dp5843
g2
V(interrupting) If we can fight our way back to the bay, then we'll be able to fly the jumper to a safe distance. That is, if we can get the underwater bay door open.
p5844
sg4
I34
sa(dp5845
g2
V(defensively) Hey, I'm workin' in it!
p5846
sg4
I6
sa(dp5847
g2
VNo-no-no-no-no-no, we can't leave them here. They know too much.
p5848
sg4
I10
sa(dp5849
g2
VUh, uh, I mean, they guessed most of it.
p5850
sg4
I9
sa(dp5851
g2
VI thought I would have time to get them out of here! (to O'Neill) Look, just forget what I said.
p5852
sg4
I20
sa(dp5853
g2
VOkay, that should do it.
p5854
sg4
I5
sa(dp5855
g2
V\u2026And it's all over but the crying.
p5856
sg4
I7
sa(dp5857
g2
VWhat the hell?
p5858
sg4
I3
sa(dp5859
g2
VNo wonder they weren't coming after us. They've been busy repairing the city.
p5860
sg4
I13
sa(dp5861
g2
VThey brought their ZPMs to power the stardrive.
p5862
sg4
I8
sa(dp5863
g2
VThe city about to take off.
p5864
sg4
I6
sa(dp5865
g2
VTime to start crying.
p5866
sg4
I4
sa(dp5867
g2
VYeah, "most" ain't gonna cut it. For this plan to work, it is all or nothing.
p5868
sg4
I16
sa(dp5869
g2
VWell, maybe they wanna fly home, back to their homeworld.
p5870
sg4
I10
sa(dp5871
g2
VWell, I\u2026
p5872
sg4
I2
sa(dp5873
g2

sa(dp5881
g2
VWell, it's desperate\u2026
p5882

VWe need to split into groups.
p5884

VIf we're gonna destroy these guys using Replicator disruptors, we have to hit them all at once. We'll probably only get a dozen or so shots off before they manage to figure out the frequency.
p5886
sg4
I35
sa(dp5887
g2
VClever, yes. Or we could figure out a way to send one massive blast through the city. Look, follow me.
p5888
sg4
I20
sa(dp5889
g2
VAtlantis has ten of these emitters with which it creates the city's shields. So, if we can interface the crystals from the disrupter weapons with those of the shield emitters, we should be able to trigger a massive anti-Replicator wave throughout the city.
p5890
sg4
I43
sa(dp5891
g2
VExactly. Now, I need to show you how to do this, so listen carefully. You slide out the crystal tray, you take the crystal from the Replicator weapon, you place it in the third slot from the right. Third symbol from the left activates the crystal tray. Clear on that? Great.
p5892
sg4
I51

g2
VI already thought of that. That's what the C-4's for.

VNo. We feed them misinformation.
p5896

VCheck it out. Found it in the Ancient database. They have a whole subsection on indigenous Lantean animal life. Did you know that there was a lobster-like crustacean down there the size of a Buick?
p5942
sg4
I35
sa(dp5943

sa(dp6013
g2
V(shouting) It's the whales!
p6014
sg4
I4
sa(dp6015

g2
VOh!
p6018

V(shouting) Yeah, we need to check out a lab.
p6022

V(loudly) It's a bio-lab. It turned up in my whale research.
p6024
sg4
I11
sa(dp6025
g2
V(continuing) Formerly flooded. With the area finally repaired, we're now able to access it. According to the database, the Ancient biologists used it to study animal life on the planet. Look, there may be some more information stored there.
p6026

I39
sa(dp6027
g2
V(loudly) But we won't know that for sure until I can have a look at it.

g2
V(in normal voice) All right. Let's see.
p6034
sg4

sa(dp6035

p6036

g2
VCome on. You should see this.
p6038
sg4
I6
sa(dp6039
g2
VWhat?
p6040
sg4
I1
sa(dp6041
g2
V(to Weir) What is he\u2026?
p6042
sg4
I5
sa(dp6043
g2
VIt's like a receiver calibrated to the specific frequencies on which the whales communicate.
p6044
sg4
I14
sa(dp6045
g2
VThey were studying the whales' language, trying to assign frequencies to emotions and identify moods.
p6046
sg4
I15
sa(dp6047
g2
VAh. Not ghosts\u2014image projections. There appears to be a causal relationship with the whales. They may very well be what's been projecting the images to us, and this receiver should , from what I can tell so far, be able to interpret them.
p6048
sg4
I43
sa(dp6049
g2
VNo. No, it seems the whales may be using the images to warn us.
p6050
sg4
I14
sa(dp6051
g2
VAh, well, that, uh\u2026that I don't know yet.
p6052
sg4
I8
sa(dp6053
g2
VHe can hear you, you know!
p6054
sg4
I6
sa(dp6055
g2
VOkay, let's have a listen.
p6056
sg4
I5
sa(dp6057
g2
VThat's because it's gibberish. Well, to be more accurate, it's an attempt at mimicry. Look, it turns out the receiver is also a transmitter. The Ancients weren't just trying to learn the whales' language; they were attempting to teach them theirs by sending them auditory and visual signals. And while they were doing that, they experienced a traumatic moment which the whales then stored in their genetic memory.
p6058
sg4
I68
sa(dp6059
g2
VExactly. Reruns. Now, unfortunately, these whales are several generations removed from the incident, so they're, um, finding the language a bit of a tough go. It's kind of like trying to sing the lyrics to the macarena. You can sound out the words, but you have no idea what you're singing.
p6060
sg4
I51
sa(dp6061
g2
VThat would be my assumption as well, yes.
p6062
sg4
I8
sa(dp6063
g2
VI don't know. Possibly.
p6064
sg4
I4
sa(dp6065
g2
VAh. Interesting thing is, the Ancients seemed to be aware of the whales' deficient mimicry skills, and so they incorporated a kind of, um\u2026acoustic language filter into the receiver. That's what's been taking me so long to figure out.
p6066
sg4
I39
sa(dp6067
g2
VWell, let's have a listen, shall we?
p6068
sg4
I7
sa(dp6069
g2
VWell, just hang on, hang on. If I, um\u2026
p6070
sg4
I9
sa(dp6071
g2
VHa!
p6072
sg4
I1
sa(dp6073
g2
VMeaning Atlantis.
p6074
sg4
I2
sa(dp6075
g2
VWell, actually, I did most of the figuring, but, uh \u2026
p6076
sg4
I11
sa(dp6077
g2
VIt's an Ancient science vessel. About, uh, fifteen thousand years ago, it ran into some trouble. The entire crew was killed except for the pilot.
p6078
sg4
I25
sa(dp6079
g2
VWhich would explain the burns.
p6080
sg4
I5
sa(dp6081
g2
VIt's a coronal mass ejection on a scale that dwarfs anything our sun has ever emitted. Apparently the sun in this solar system goes through an unusually turbulent sunspot cycle every fifteen thousand years or so. The Ancients have records of this class of CME occurring twice before.
p6082
sg4
I48
sa(dp6083
g2
VIt's a massive prominence. It arced up and then collapsed when the magnetic field surrounding it weakened. We're talking an intense proton stream traveling at over four thousand kilometers per second.
p6084
sg4
I31
sa(dp6085
g2
VAnd the Ancients were able to raise the shield and extend it far enough to protect a large portion of the planet from the blast.
p6086
sg4
I25
sa(dp6087
g2
VNot soon. It's happening right now.
p6088
sg4
I6
sa(dp6089
g2
VThe magnetic field around it is already beginning to weaken. When that prominence collapses, the coronal mass ejection will occur. It'll erupt from a very small area \u2014 a mere pinprick in comparison to the total sun's surface. But it'll immediately begin to fan out. Within a few million miles, the blast wave will cut a swath wide enough to take out this entire planet.
p6090
sg4
I65
sa(dp6091
g2
VWell, because these things happen very quickly.
p6092
sg4
I7
sa(dp6093
g2
VNot to mention our focus was on attack from the Wraith, not the sun.
p6094
sg4
I14
sa(dp6095
g2
VWell, a lot of animals: whales, dolphins \u2026
p6096

I8
sa(dp6097
g2
V\u2026are affected by the tiniest anomalies in the magnetosphere. It's as if their, uh, internal compasses are somehow, eh\u2026Pigeons?!
p6098
sg4
I19
sa(dp6099
g2
VPigeon races?
p6100
sg4
I2
sa(dp6101
g2
VWell, it's still somewhat of a mystery how they're able to sense this trouble, but they do, often well before we do.
p6102
sg4
I22
sa(dp6103
g2
VWell, the Ancients were able to raise the shield and stretch it wide enough to protect a significant portion of the planet\u2014attenuated, to be sure, more of a thin bubble\u2014but it was able to, uh, block out enough of the radiation.
p6104
sg4
I41
sa(dp6105
g2
VWow! Well, now we know what caused it.
p6106
sg4
I8
sa(dp6107
g2
VAh. Small problem. The Ancients had three ZPMs at their disposal. We, as you know, only have one. Well, maybe I was so insistent on keeping them, because I too am able to sense trouble on the horizon.
p6108
sg4
I38
sa(dp6109
g2
V(interrupting) Not enough time. Look, the Odyssey's away from Earth. In the time it would take them to return, the blast wave would almost certainly have hit us.
p6110
sg4
I28
sa(dp6111
g2
VYeah, we can't gate to Earth. Look, we need the ZPM's power for the shields.
p6112
sg4
I15
sa(dp6113
g2
VThe midway station isn't completed yet. We'd need to ferry people by jumper. Again, no time.
p6114
sg4
I16
sa(dp6115
g2
VI don't think you understand. Look, the shield will protect the city from the initial blast, yes, but the entire ecosystem of this planet will be damaged beyond recovery for hundreds of years. Look, we're talking no plant life, which means no breathable air. We're\u2026
p6116
sg4
I45
sa(dp6117
g2
VNo-no-no-no-no-no-no. We don't have nearly enough power. Look, we can extend the shield twenty kilometers beyond the city, maybe. But it'll be dangerously thin and there's no way of knowing whether we can sustain it, especially in a radiation blast of fifty thousand REM.
p6118
sg4
I44
sa(dp6119
g2
VWe do?
p6120
sg4
I2
sa(dp6121
g2
V(sighing) This is not a good plan.
p6122

I7
sa(dp6123
g2
VYou realize just how close we'll have to get to the sun?
p6124
sg4
I12

g2
VNo, suicidally close. I mean, we'll be toast.
p6126
sg4
I8
sa(dp6127
g2
VOkay, okay. You want to deflect the coronal mass ejection away from the planet.
p6128
sg4
I14
sa(dp6129
g2
VOkay, listen to me. This. This is the sun; and this. This is us. A bolt of energy unlike anything you could possibly comprehend is gonna shoot out of the photosphere at a tremendous velocity, Okay? It is immediately gonna start fanning out, like so.
p6130
sg4
I45
sa(dp6131
g2
VWhich means that we will have to be really close to the surface of the sun if we wanna intercept that stream and deflect it before it can start spreading out.
p6132
sg4
I31
sa(dp6133
g2
VNo, no, I don't think you do. I don't think you fully grasp the reality of just how damned hot it gets that close to the surface of the sun.
p6134
sg4
I30
sa(dp6135
g2
VFrom the blast wave, yes. But even with the shields at that strength, the-the build-up of residual heat behind it could cause serious problems for the Daedalus, and everyone inside it.
p6136
sg4
I31
sa(dp6137
g2
VOkay. Tell me, if this is such a great plan, why didn't the Ancients do it?

g2
V(annoyed) What?
p6140

VWhy are you looking at me?
p6190
sg4
I6
sa(dp6191

VWh-wh-wh-wait. Am I the only person here who thinks he is taking advantage of these poor people.
p6192
sg4
I17
sa(dp6193
g2
VYou're damn right I do! Look, it can come in extremely handy. Look, he's practically wasting it!
p6194
sg4
I17
sa(dp6195
g2
V(low, worried) And us\u2026we risk injuring us.
p6196

sa(dp6197

V(pointing to himself) We're the good guys.
p6198

p6202

sa(dp6203
g2
VAnd if they burn the town down around you out of spite?
p6204
sg4
I12
sa(dp6205

VWell, we could call it, uh, strategic concealment.
p6206

g2
VOh!
p6212
sg4
I1
sa(dp6213
g2
V(between mouthfuls) Eh, if they haven't found him yet, chances are he managed to slip the perimeter.
p6214
sg4
I17
sa(dp6215
g2
VLucius?
p6216
sg4
I1
sa(dp6217
g2
VOh sure he wouldn't. Just like he wouldn't sell us out while we were trying to rescue him.
p6218
sg4
I18
sa(dp6219
g2
VOkay, you know what? Just stop it! All right? Lucius is not a superhero! Batman, that's a superhero.
p6220
sg4
I18
sa(dp6221
g2
VOkay, just pretend he didn't say that, and then just let us out of here.
p6222
sg4
I15

g2
VSee if you can find another spoon. With someone helping, this will go twice as fast.
p6224

I16

VThat's funny, he says the same thing about you.
p6226

VI thought you said that personal shield was depleted?
p6238
sg4
I9
sa(dp6239
g2
VShe used to leave the lights on, all over the house. Every room. Drove my father nuts.
p6240
sg4
I17
sa(dp6241
g2
VWell, you know what? No one wants to hear any more stories about how poor you were as a child, all right? We already feel as sorry for you as is humanly possible.
p6242
sg4
I33
sa(dp6243
g2
VMy sister was afraid of the dark. Aw, and used to blame me for leaving the lights on. Of course, my father believed her. He never sided with me.
p6244
sg4
I29
sa(dp6245
g2
V(annoyed) You know, at least my stories relate to what we're doing.
p6246
sg4
I12
sa(dp6247
g2
VWe're trekking all over the city, shutting down everything the Ancients activated while they were oh so briefly in control, so we can stop the power from draining from our one precious ZPM. How does that relate to your idiot brother burning the house down?

g2
VHmm? Thank god.
p6252
sg4
I3
sa(dp6253
g2
VReally? You think so? You know, I don't get these Ancients. They're supposed to be so smart? Then why activate something that you don't need and you're not using, huh?
p6254
sg4
I30
sa(dp6255
g2
V(piqued) Yes, yes. We all know what happened.

sa(dp6261

V(pointing at Zelenka) You\u2014 (to others) Okay, you know what? Look around, see if you can figure out how to turn this place off\u2026whatever it is.
p6262
sg4
I26
sa(dp6263
g2
VHow else am I going to find out what this place does, huh? (muttering) God forbid there should be anything in the Ancient database.

VOh, here we go.
p6266

V(scoffing) Oh, you're on.
p6270
sg4
I4
sa(dp6271
g2
VAll right. It's gonna be around here somewhere.
p6272
sg4
I8
sa(dp6273
g2
VI'm not sure, but I think I just lost. Big time.
p6274
sg4
I11
sa(dp6275
g2
VI was hit by a mysterious energy pulse. How can that possibly be fine?!
p6276
sg4
I14
sa(dp6277
g2
VOkay, one more time\u2014mysterious energy pulse! From a device created by the Ancients?! I mean, who knows what kind of long-term effects I could be in for. I mean, there's gross mutation, giantism, invisibility\u2026?
p6278
sg4
I34
sa(dp6279

VAre you insane?! Look, I need to be put under guard. Who knows what I could become!

g2
V(annoyed) Do you mind? We're trying to work here.
p6290
sg4
I9
sa(dp6291
g2
V(dubious) Yeah, sure you were. (to Zelenka) What have you got?
p6292
sg4
I11
sa(dp6293
g2
VWhatever I did?! Look, up until very recently, this lab was entirely underwater, quite possibly for over ten thousand years. How is that my fault?
p6294
sg4
I25
sa(dp6295
g2
VOkay, that's it. I'm going for lunch.
p6296
sg4
I7
sa(dp6297
g2
VHello, I'm right here. I can\u2014
p6298
sg4
I6
sa(dp6299
g2
V(softly, lost in thought) I can hear you. Huh.
p6300
sg4
I9
sa(dp6301
g2
V(agitated) For your information, I am exactly the same weight I've been since I got here. I need to eat regularly, otherwise I become hypoglycemic. And I am generally a very happy person.
p6302
sg4
I33
sa(dp6303
g2
VWhat else could it be?
p6304
sg4
I5
sa(dp6305
g2
VI'm telling you it's a bit of a coincidence!
p6306
sg4
I9
sa(dp6307
g2
VWell, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. I wasn't even sure it was me, at first. But, uh, the correlation's impossible to ignore. I saw Lorne's team pinned down, the bad guys closing in, I just thought, uh, wouldn't it be great if all of their weapons jammed\u2026at the same time.
p6308
sg4
I52
sa(dp6309
g2
VLook, next thing I know, they're all running away, so\u2026
p6310
sg4
I10
sa(dp6311
g2
VIt was a little more than that.
p6312
sg4
I7
sa(dp6313
g2
VOkay, you know what? Watch this! I'll uh\u2026
p6314
sg4
I8
sa(dp6315
g2
VBelieve me, I find this as disturbing as you do.
p6316
sg4
I10
sa(dp6317
g2
VRight.
p6318
sg4
I1
sa(dp6319
g2
VPowers. Plural.
p6320
sg4
I2
sa(dp6321
g2
V(speaking quickly) Well, super-hearing for one, and I'm not sure, but I may actually be getting smarter. It's hard to say for sure, because I was-I was pretty smart to start with, but, um, recently I've been having some ideas that I don't think even I would've thought of before.
p6322
sg4
I50
sa(dp6323
g2
VOh, finally! Look, keep it coming.
p6324
sg4
I6
sa(dp6325
g2
VYes, very funny.
p6326
sg4
I3
sa(dp6327
g2
V(mouth full) I have a very active metabolism.
p6328
sg4
I8
sa(dp6329
g2
VWell, that device I found must have been some kind of an accelerator. We know that the Ancients developed all kinds of powers as they evolved. It was just a matter of bad luck that we didn't run into that lab earlier. Seriously, me a superhero. Who would've thought it?
p6330
sg4
I50
sa(dp6331
g2
VCome on, you can't keep me cooped up in here forever.
p6332
sg4
I11
sa(dp6333
g2
VExactly, so let me go out and start using my powers to do some good. Ooh, are you, uh, going to finish\u2026that?
p6334
sg4
I22
sa(dp6335
g2
V(smugly) Please, mutation has such negative connotations. Advancement is more like it.
p6336
sg4
I12
sa(dp6337
g2
VCarson, I'm still me. Anyway, it's not like you or, uh, these guys could stop me from leaving anyways.
p6338
sg4
I19
sa(dp6339
g2
V(with bravado) Oh, you care to put that to a test?
p6340
sg4
I11
sa(dp6341
g2
VWell\u2026no. Not really.
p6342
sg4
I3
sa(dp6343
g2
VCheck in every couple of hours. Yes, yes. Ba-bye!
p6344
sg4
I9
sa(dp6345
g2
V(mouth full) You know, we could be a team. You could be my sidekick.
p6346
sg4
I14
sa(dp6347
g2
VYeah, it'll be like Batman and Ronon. Has a nice ring to it.
p6348
sg4
I13
sa(dp6349
g2
VI'm warning you, you will probably be bored out of your mind. Unless you find incredibly advanced physics to be\u2014
p6350
sg4
I20
sa(dp6351
g2
VReally?
p6352
sg4
I1
sa(dp6353
g2
VWhat, do you think so? Huh. Hey, she thinks I'm hot.
p6354
sg4
I11
sa(dp6355
g2
VOh, no-no-no. I'm sure that you\u2026uh\u2026 Oh, of course, no, I should've known. (to Ronon) She meant you.
p6356
sg4
I18
sa(dp6357
g2
VOh my god, I can read minds. Oh, this is cool!
p6358
sg4
I11
sa(dp6359
g2
VOh, I'm fine\u2026No\u2026Yes\u2026And, it doesn't.
p6360
sg4
I5
sa(dp6361
g2
VI can read your mind. Uh, everyone's actually. Thought it was very cool for the first, like, ten seconds, there, but uh\u2026now, I'm finding it a little disturbing, so I'm trying to tune it out as much as I possibly can. (glancing at Ronon) Well, um, sort of. Anyways, Look, I, uh, wanted to get your permission to access the control chair. I've, uh, got some, um, pretty interesting ideas for maximizing our ZPM by, uh, reconfiguring the city's power systems. It's too complicated to explain, but, uh, trust me when I say that you are going to be incredibly happy with the results.
p6362
sg4
I104
sa(dp6363
g2
VLook, Elizabeth, I-I know you have every right not to trust me, but, uh, I promise you, I'm going to make things much-much better. Okay?
p6364
sg4
I25
sa(dp6365
g2
VGood. (to Ronon) She wants you to shoot me, if, uh, you think for even one second I might be trying to take over the city for my own evil purposes.
p6366
sg4
I31
sa(dp6367
g2
VI'm kidding. That was a joke. Heh, it's uh\u2026 Is your weapon set to\u2026uh\u2026stun? Wait, never mind, did it myself.
p6368
sg4
I20
sa(dp6369
g2
VTo the chair room, Ronon!
p6370
sg4
I5
sa(dp6371
g2
V(calling out from control room) I can hear you! Look, she just wants you to keep a close eye on me. Come on, let's go. Chop-chop. Much to do.
p6372
sg4
I29
sa(dp6373
g2
VI know. Awesome, isn't it?
p6374
sg4
I5
sa(dp6375
g2
VIt's just temporary.
p6376
sg4
I3
sa(dp6377
g2
V(realizing) You're jealous.
p6378
sg4
I3
sa(dp6379
g2
VThat is not true. My head\u2026which happens to be housing my ever-evolving brain, is actually being better utilized here, doing important things that will affect everybody.
p6380
sg4
I26
sa(dp6381
g2
VHe tries to hide it, but deep down, I'm the wind beneath his wings. Hmm.
p6382
sg4
I15
sa(dp6383
g2
V(smugly) You can all relax. I'll have us back online in\u2026two minutes.
p6384
sg4
I12
sa(dp6385
g2
V(panicked) What do you mean, I'm going to die? I'm not even sick! I feel great! Never better!
p6386
sg4
I18
sa(dp6387
g2
VHas accelerated my evolution. (turning to Weir) Eventually, I'll reach a point where I'm physically capable of ascension, but ascension takes more than that. There's a-there's a mental component. I need to know how to make it happen. Which I don't\u2026 (spinning to Ronon, annoyed) Yet! I'm getting smarter by the minute. It's a pretty good assumption I'll be able to, uh, figure it out on the way?
p6388
sg4
I68
sa(dp6389
g2
VOkay, so it's not as easy as that. Yeah, well, even if I don't\u2026so, I'll stay a highly-evolved human. I mean, I don't have to ascend. It's a choice, right?
p6390
sg4
I30
sa(dp6391
g2
VNo? What do you mean, no? Aw, that stupid Ancient device doesn't work properly, does it?
p6392
sg4
I16
sa(dp6393
g2
V(with disbelief) It's set in motion a series of genetic mutations that will result in my death if I don't ascend?!
p6394
sg4
I21
sa(dp6395
g2
V(upset) That's why the Ancients didn't put it into common use. It's just one more in a long line of abysmal, overambitious failures! Oh god, I'm a dead man!
p6396
sg4
I29
sa(dp6397
g2
VYes, yes. I just\u2014it's because I stopped in the middle. I will fix it. Just give me a second here.
p6398
sg4
I20
sa(dp6399
g2
VOkay, so, there's still time left, right? So, maybe there's a way to reverse the process. Zelenka. Where's Zelenka? What the hell has he been doing?
p6400
sg4
I26
sa(dp6401
g2
VDamn it!
p6402

VRadek!
p6404
sg4
I1
sa(dp6405
g2
VMove!
p6406
sg4
I1
sa(dp6407
g2
VNo! Just give me a second. I know.
p6408
sg4
I8
sa(dp6409
g2
VHold on\u2026!
p6410
sg4
I2
sa(dp6411
g2
VEh, I invented a new math.
p6412
sg4
I6
sa(dp6413
g2
VUm, it's going to change the human understanding of the universe as we know it. How is, uh, Zelenka?
p6414
sg4
I19
sa(dp6415
g2
VUm, I'm blocking out people's thoughts. It was, uh, becoming too overwhelming. I was, uh, I wasn't able to think.
p6416
sg4
I20
sa(dp6417
g2
VI know what you're going to say.
p6418
sg4
I7
sa(dp6419
g2
VOh\u2026no. Uh\u2026just intuition, I swear. I just\u2014I tried to fix the Ancient device, but it wasn't meant to reverse the process. And once the mutation has started, it cannot be stopped.
p6420
sg4
I31
sa(dp6421
g2
V(surprised) Oh. Uh\u2026well, I've already reread everything I could in the database.
p6422
sg4
I12
sa(dp6423
g2
VNo. And to be honest, you know, I've never been all that big on the whole idea of ascending in the first place. There's too many rules, you know? I-I mean, to me, life is-is about working towards achievement, you know? Discovering things\u2026
p6424
sg4
I43
sa(dp6425
g2
VExactly! I mean, once you know it all, what do you do then?
p6426
sg4
I13
sa(dp6427
g2
VSee, I've never been big on leaps of faith either. I mean, sure, there was a part of me that from the beginning knew that this was too good to be true. Nothing this great could ever happen to me without really, really bad consequences. Anyways, now I have\u2026come to terms with that, and-and I just want to get as much done in the time I have left, and not waste my time on a bunch of mumbo-jumbo I'm not going to understand anyways. Oh, I've, uh, come up with a way for increasing the Daedalus's shield power. Tell Hermiod to, uh, give me a call if he needs any help understanding the base code.
p6428
sg4
I115
sa(dp6429
g2
VWhy didn't I think of that?
p6430
sg4
I6
sa(dp6431
g2
V(excited) I had this shipped from the SGC.
p6432
sg4
I8
sa(dp6433
g2
VAh, more than that, the brain's evolutionary level. But it's basically, an "ascendometer."
p6434
sg4
I13
sa(dp6435
g2
VIf you're a highly evolved super-genius, put up your hand. Oh!
p6436
sg4
I11
sa(dp6437
g2
VLook, when you get down to it, even mental states are actually only physical states, are they not? I mean, the brain is just a-a chemical supercomputer.
p6438
sg4
I27
sa(dp6439
g2
V"Yes" is all you need to say, my friend. Look, the universe may seem mystical to\u2026those without understanding. (gestures to Beckett, who shakes his head, annoyed) When in truth, anything and everything can be quantified. Look, all that hocus-pocus stuff is just a way of getting the brain into the, uh, proper electro-chemical state to allow the final physical evolution. At which point, the matter that makes up this body will turn into pure energy. Oh, what, uh, "mere mortals" would refer to as the "mystery of ascension", is actually just a-a scientific process. Just protons and electrons. Protons and electrons.
p6440
sg4
I101
sa(dp6441
g2
VNow, if you don't mind, can we, uh\u2026
p6442
sg4
I8
sa(dp6443
g2
VYeah. Ah. Now, based upon what I've extrapolated from the, uh, Ancient research, I've been able to set measurable parameters for achieving the, uh, proper mental state. Once I reach ninety-six percent synaptic connection as measured by this device, all I need to is maintain an EEG frequency of 0.1 to 0.9 hertz and presto\u2026 (snaps fingers) I arise to a higher plane of existence.
p6444
sg4
I65
sa(dp6445
g2
V(smugly) No un-evolved person.
p6446
sg4
I4
sa(dp6447
g2
VJust turn it on!
p6448
sg4
I4
sa(dp6449
g2
VYes! I don't have much time left. As I said, by my calculations, when I reach ninety-six percent, I either ascend or die. Now, what's my EEG?
p6450
sg4
I27
sa(dp6451
g2
VOkay, so I just need to, uh, clear my mind and\u2026uh\u2026relax.
p6452
sg4
I11
sa(dp6453
g2
VWhat's it at now?
p6454
sg4
I4
sa(dp6455
g2
VWhat?! Aw, come on, that's impossible! You must have me hooked up wrong!
p6456
sg4
I13
sa(dp6457
g2
VTrust me, this will work. I just need some more time. Now, stop talking so much. You're-you're rippling my pond. Hmm. Um-mm-mm-mm.
p6458
sg4
I22
sa(dp6459
g2
V(piqued) How else am I going to know if it's working at all? Look, you're teaching me how to meditate\u2014not exactly good odds there to start with.
p6460
sg4
I27
sa(dp6461
g2
VSo why am I here?
p6462
sg4
I5
sa(dp6463
g2
VOh. Yeah, me too.
p6464
sg4
I4
sa(dp6465
g2
VWhat? Wha-no-of course it is!
p6466
sg4
I5
sa(dp6467
g2
VThat is exactly what I'm trying to do! Look, from what I understand, I mean, dishonesty is not going to help the process.
p6468
sg4
I23
sa(dp6469
g2
VYou know, while we're at it, my knees are killing me. How does anyone relax like this?
p6470
sg4
I17

VRight. Okay.
p6472

p6474

I4
sa(dp6475
g2
VOh, right.
p6476
sg4
I2
sa(dp6477
g2
V(opening his eyes) You mean like death?
p6478
sg4
I7
sa(dp6479
g2
VOh god, there's so many things. Not talking happens to be one of them, by the way.
p6480
sg4
I17
sa(dp6481
g2
VWhat?!
p6482
sg4
I1
sa(dp6483
g2
VWhy am I not surprised you didn't ascend, huh?! (sitting up) Okay, look, I'm a busy man. You're a busy man. We're both busy men.
p6484
sg4
I25
sa(dp6485
g2
VRight.
p6486
sg4
I1
sa(dp6487
g2
VHow is that comforting?
p6488
sg4
I4
sa(dp6489
g2
VI just thought of a brilliant adjunct to the chaos theory! Look, I should write this down!
p6490
sg4
I17
sa(dp6491
g2
V(regretfully) Uh\u2026Letting it go!\u2026Letting it go.
p6492
sg4
I6
sa(dp6493
g2
VBright blue sky\u2026I am there.
p6494
sg4
I5
sa(dp6495
g2
V(whispering) How am I doing?
p6496
sg4
I5
sa(dp6497
g2
VAw, forget it. Look this is never going to work.
p6498
sg4
I10
sa(dp6499
g2
VI just realized why light behaves as both particles and waves.
p6500
sg4
I11
sa(dp6501
g2
V(interrupting) I know! I don't have much time left.
p6502
sg4
I9
sa(dp6503
g2
VHmm. Just a second.
p6504
sg4
I4
sa(dp6505
g2
VThere are, like, fifty simulations I'd like to be running right now, but the computers can't keep up with me. The irony being that I've actually figured out how to make them run ten times faster, but I haven't had time to actually stop and do it. Oh, I've, uh, uploaded the, uh, virtual prototype for a hyperspace generator for the puddle jumpers into the database.
p6506
sg4
I66
sa(dp6507
g2
VSpend my last couple of days alive? Don't have much choice, do I?
p6508
sg4
I13
sa(dp6509
g2
VWe both know that that is a waste of time. Maybe you could do it, but\u2014
p6510
sg4
I16
sa(dp6511
g2
VTo be honest, I don't have the first clue where to start.
p6512
sg4
I12
sa(dp6513
g2
VSee, now, I don't understand that!
p6514
sg4
I6
sa(dp6515
g2
V(dismissively) Oh, please.
p6516
sg4
I3
sa(dp6517
g2
VBut you have to believe\u2014
p6518
sg4
I5
sa(dp6519
g2
VSo what you're telling me is that I don't think I'm worthy?
p6520
sg4
I12
sa(dp6521
g2
V(defensively) Like what?
p6522
sg4
I3
sa(dp6523
g2
V(quietly) Ah, well\u2026I appreciate that.
p6524
sg4
I5
sa(dp6525
g2
VRadek\u2026I think it's safe to say that, uh, I am at times a, uh, petty, vindictive, even a\u2026jealous man. I supplement my own\u2026anxieties or feelings of inadequacy by creating a\u2026bubble of hostility around myself. I know you, probably more than anyone else, have had to bear the brunt of that hostility.
p6526
sg4
I51
sa(dp6527
g2
VActually, I do. Here's the thing\u2026you're a brilliant scientist, and a-and a decent human being. And you should not have had to endure the kind of\u2026abuse that you've taken from me in the past few years. I hope you can find a way to forgive me for all the things I've said and done to you. You deserve\u2026much better than that. So-so I wanted you to know that.
p6528
sg4
I68
sa(dp6529
g2
VYes.
p6530
sg4
I1
sa(dp6531
g2
VHmm. Mind if I come in?
p6532
sg4
I6
sa(dp6533
g2
V(talking over her) Hope you don't mind.
p6534
sg4
I7
sa(dp6535
g2
VI was talking with Halling, and he happened to mention that it was the anniversary of the death of your father next week.
p6536
sg4
I23
sa(dp6537
g2
VOkay, I might have asked a few, uh, pointed questions. But, um, I just thought it would be nice if\u2026uh\u2026What I mean is\u2026I would be honored if you let me share the memorial tea ceremony with you. I don't know if it's wrong to do it early or anything, but, um, I may not be around next week. Anyway, I understand it's something you're not supposed to do alone.
p6538
sg4
I69
sa(dp6539
g2
VNo-no-no-no-no. I know exactly what to do. You are the one who's lost a loved one. I will serve you.
p6540
sg4
I20
sa(dp6541
g2
V(out of breath) Hey, buddy! Pal! I've been looking all over for you! Checked the, uh, gym, the mess\u2026
p6542
sg4
I19
sa(dp6543
g2
VNo, you're weren't. It's usually one of those is a\u2026good bet. So, where you off to? Shooting range? A little, uh, target practice?
p6544
sg4
I23
sa(dp6545
g2
VOh, no. No, no, no. Of course you don't.
p6546
sg4
I9
sa(dp6547
g2
VLook, I don't know how much time I have left, so I'm just going to\u2026cut to the chase here. Ask you a rather, uh, personal question. Hopefully, you won't just hit me in the face.
p6548
sg4
I35
sa(dp6549
g2
VAsking away. Those\u2026scars on your back, from\u2026your encounters with the Wraith? You know, with the, uh,\u2026tracking device, that\u2026?
p6550
sg4
I18
sa(dp6551
g2
VAre those like a\u2026a badge of honor\u2026for you? Or are they just a\u2026constant reminder of something you'd rather forget?
p6552
sg4
I19
sa(dp6553
g2
VI mean, I know it's none of my business. I just\u2026
p6554
sg4
I11
sa(dp6555
g2
V(surprised) That's very healthy.
p6556
sg4
I4
sa(dp6557
g2
VHope you don't mind. I just healed them.
p6558
sg4
I8
sa(dp6559
g2
VYou're not still trying to find a way out of this for me, are you?
p6560
sg4
I15
sa(dp6561
g2
VHuh. Look, all the Ancients that experimented with that device\u2014they either ascended or died, most of them the latter, which is why it did not get put into common use.
p6562
sg4
I30
sa(dp6563
g2
VAh. Yes. Well\u2026this will all be over soon, and you can get back to some real work.
p6564
sg4
I17
sa(dp6565
g2
VNo, no, no. I'm not\u2026I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just, uh\u2026Hey, I just wanted to give you that.
p6566
sg4
I19
sa(dp6567
g2
VOh, nothing. That's a-that's a book.
p6568
sg4
I6
sa(dp6569
g2
VYou. Well, you've taken a lot of crap as the, uh, leader of this expedition, and I just thought someone should, uh, leave a record of all the good things you've done. Everything you've done\u2026right.
p6570
sg4
I35
sa(dp6571
g2
VWell, yes, I know. I know. I just -I just thought that, um, I would have, uh, somewhat of a\u2026unique perspective that other people might benefit from. You know, I, uh, actually took the liberty of, uh, doing some research into your past and, uh, included that as well. I'm sorry if I'm not a very good writer. It, uh, might be a bit, uh, overly maudlin in places?
p6572
sg4
I69
sa(dp6573
g2
VAnyway, that's all. Right.
p6574
sg4
I4
sa(dp6575
g2
VWhat's it down to?
p6576
sg4
I4
sa(dp6577
g2
VWhat? Look, of course it is. It's got to\u2014
p6578
sg4
I9
sa(dp6579
g2
VWhat, seventeen hertz?! That's not even close!
p6580
sg4
I7
sa(dp6581
g2
VAw, forget it.
p6582
sg4
I3
sa(dp6583
g2
VI don't know how to do that, okay? I'm me! I don't know how not to be me! Look, thank you for all of your help. I think, in the-in the grand scheme of things, we're-we're good, aren't we?
p6584
sg4
I39
sa(dp6585
g2
V(quietly) Good. Well, then, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like you to read my eulogy.
p6586
sg4
I17
sa(dp6587
g2
VJust keep it simple. Um, make up a few\u2026nice things, er\u2026I'd like my little sister to be there. And, um, oh! You should know that I told Beckett that he should most definitely do a full autopsy. He can use my body for any kind of, uh, experimentation, that might prove helpful, and, uh, oh, then I'd like to be cremated. I'd like my-my ashes to be, uh, thrown out into space from the jumper. So, uh\u2026
p6588
sg4
I77
sa(dp6589
g2
VGah!
p6590
sg4
I1
sa(dp6591
g2
V(weakly) About six percent?
p6592
sg4
I4
sa(dp6593
g2
V(weakly) It's okay. You know, I'm actually feeling a sense of\u2026peace\u2026interspersed with moments of sheer terror, of course.
p6594
sg4
I18
sa(dp6595
g2
VMay as well go out fighting, eh?
p6596
sg4
I7
sa(dp6597
g2
VHook me up.
p6598
sg4
I3
sa(dp6599
g2
VCarson\u2026thank you. Thank you for everything.
p6600
sg4
I6
sa(dp6601
g2
V(voice growing even weaker) Clear blue skies. All my troubles\u2026just drifting away. Okay, stop talking now.
p6602
sg4
I16
sa(dp6603
g2
V(rallying slightly) You love me? Really? All of you?
p6604
sg4
I9
sa(dp6605
g2
V(weaker) You're just saying that because I'm going to die. Oh god. I can't believe I'm going to die!
p6606
sg4
I19
sa(dp6607
g2
VIt worked!
p6608
sg4
I2
sa(dp6609
g2
V(petulantly) Well, I'm alive, aren't I?
p6610
sg4
I6
sa(dp6611
g2
VYes, yes. I can't hear one of your thoughts.
p6612
sg4
I9
sa(dp6613
g2
VTelekinesis is gone.
p6614
sg4
I3
sa(dp6615
g2
VI'm still smart\u2026I think. (pausing) Yes\u2026yes, I'm me! I'm my old self!
p6616
sg4
I12
sa(dp6617
g2
V(elated) Yeah! I-I'm alive! I feel great! I feel, uh, um\u2026hungry?
p6618
sg4
I11
sa(dp6619
g2
VThe answer just\u2026came to me. I was-I was-I was floating in this big black emptiness, and then-and then the answer came out of nowhere! Look, the device was designed to manipulate your DNA. It couldn't "reverse" the evolutionary advancement process because everyone's DNA is different. It makes certain changes that causes the DNA to evolve in-in ways specific to your own unique physiology.
p6620
sg4
I63
sa(dp6621
g2
VWhat-what?
p6622
sg4
I1
sa(dp6623
g2
V(nonplussed) Yes, well\u2026it's good to be back.
p6624
sg4
I7
sa(dp6625
g2
VAch, terrible!
p6626
sg4
I2
sa(dp6627
g2
VOh, no-no-no-no. Physically, I am fine, but-but this doesn't make any sense! I can't figure out any of these-of these equations. I mean, the algorithms are complete gibberish. I mean, this is torture! I can clearly remember exactly how important this all is, but I cannot figure out why or-or-or how\u2026
p6628
sg4
I51
sa(dp6629
g2
VOh my god! It's 0.03 hertz! I mean, I did it! I was in the zone; I could've actually ascended!
p6630
sg4
I20
sa(dp6631
g2
VI may have momentarily thought about how hard it was to rid oneself of ego, I mean, and-and that existence without the individuality of consciousness would be pointless, but\u2026Ooh! Now that I say that, that's probably what gave me the idea of how to reprogram the device with my old device.
p6632
sg4
I51
sa(dp6633
g2
VYeah, well, you know what? I don't care if you don't think I was capable of ascension. I never wanted to do it anyways. In fact, I am very happy with who I am\u2026and you love me.
p6634
sg4
I37
sa(dp6635
g2
VYou so did! Yeah, I may not be able to understand this new math I created, but I distinctly remember that you said you love me.
p6636
sg4
I26
sa(dp6637
g2
VAnd what? What, you just said that because you thought I was dying?
p6638
sg4
I13
sa(dp6639
g2
VSee, you love me. It's true! You've said it; now I know. I always suspected it. In fact, you know what, I've always noticed that there's been a, um, indefinable yet magical chemistry between us that I think I covered in chapter ten.
p6640
sg4
I43
sa(dp6641
g2
VYou had lunch yet?
p6642
sg4
I4
sa(dp6643
g2
VMid-afternoon snack, then?
p6644
sg4
I3
sa(dp6645
g2
VAh. Now, is Sheppard still, uh, bugging you to let him use the ascension device to turn himself into some kind of a superhero?
p6646
sg4
I24
sa(dp6647
g2
VHuh. Despite the fact that the Ancient database states that its effects on people are wildly unpredictable, and that I'm just lucky I wasn't, uh, instantly melted down into a pool of protoplasm.
p6648
sg4
I33
sa(dp6649
g2
VHmm. Well, maybe you should let him.
p6650
sg4
I7
sa(dp6651
g2
VLet me ask you a question. Say there's a runaway train. It's hurtling out of control towards ten people standing in the middle of the tracks. Only way to save those people is to flip a switch, send the train down another set of tracks. The only problem is\u2014there is a baby in the middle of those tracks.
p6652
sg4
I58
sa(dp6653
g2
VWell, I-I don't know. That's not the point. It's an ethical dilemma. Look, Katie Brown brought it up over dinner the other night. Question is: is it appropriate to divert the train and kill the one baby to save the ten people?
p6654
sg4
I42
sa(dp6655
g2
VNo. No, they wouldn't see it.
p6656
sg4
I6
sa(dp6657
g2
V(sighing) Well, look, I don't know. Say they're blind.
p6658
sg4
I9
sa(dp6659
g2
V(getting annoyed) Yes. All of them.
p6660
sg4
I6
sa(dp6661
g2
VOh, because they can't hear you.
p6662
sg4
I6
sa(dp6663
g2
V(exasperated) Look, the speed doesn't matter!
p6664
sg4
I6
sa(dp6665
g2
VOh, for god's sake, I was just trying to\u2014
p6666
sg4
I9
sa(dp6667
g2
VWh-yes. Go ahead.
p6668
sg4
I3
sa(dp6669
g2
VHmm.
p6670
sg4
I1
sa(dp6671
g2
V(to team) Work it out.
p6672
sg4
I5
sa(dp6673
g2
V(agreeing) Mmm.
p6674
sg4
I2
sa(dp6675
g2
VWhy?
p6676
sg4
I1
sa(dp6677
g2
VOh, uh, I don't know.
p6678
sg4
I5
sa(dp6679
g2
V(perplexed) Wai-wait. Here's the thing though. That flag's very similar to the one I designed in our game.
p6680
sg4
I18
sa(dp6681
g2
V(innocently) Yeah, we didn't tell you about the game?
p6682
sg4
I9
sa(dp6683
g2
VYeah, off and on in our spare time\u2014you know, uh, at night, between missions, I could've sworn we told you about it.
p6684
sg4
I22
sa(dp6685
g2
VWell, it started a while ago\u2026
p6686
sg4
I6
sa(dp6687
g2
V(voiceover) Uh, a few months after we arrived here, we were exploring the city, checking out some labs on the East Pier when we discovered a room. There were several Ancient consoles and screens. It was quite an impressive layout. As usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we entered.
p6688
sg4
I51
sa(dp6689
g2
V(voiceover) At first, we thought it was some kind of a geological facility. There was a screen with a map that we assumed was of the Lantian mainland.
p6690
sg4
I28
sa(dp6691
g2
VRight, there you go. We did tell you.
p6692
sg4
I8
sa(dp6693
g2
V(voiceover) No, it turns out, it was it was in fact a-a-a kind of a\u2026Ancient game room. The map was of a fictional civilization. It was part of a simulated world.
p6694
sg4
I31
sa(dp6695
g2
VSweet!
p6696
sg4
I1
sa(dp6697
g2
VTwo societies, separated by a river straight down the middle. Sheppard took one country, I took the other.
p6698
sg4
I18
sa(dp6699
g2
VYes, but this is no ordinary game. I mean, it is incredibly challenging, instructional\u2026I mean the sheer number of options built into it? Staggering.
p6700
sg4
I24
sa(dp6701
g2
VYeah, you build roads, you, uh, establish laws, mold it to your own specific ideology.
p6702
sg4
I15
sa(dp6703
g2
V(voiceover) You can control everything. Proper sanitation systems, water delivery.
p6704
sg4
I10
sa(dp6705
g2
V(voiceover) I mean, every detail can be manipulated\u2026I mean, right down to the women's hairstyles.
p6706
sg4
I15
sa(dp6707
g2
VHello there.
p6708
sg4
I2
sa(dp6709
g2
V(voiceover) Yeah, it's more about whose society outshines the other's. I mean, who creates a better infrastructure.
p6710
sg4
I17
sa(dp6711
g2
V(continuing, smugly) \u2026who's better at trade.
p6712
sg4
I6
sa(dp6713
g2
V(innocently) What? Hey, don't start. I tried to negotiate with you.
p6714
sg4
I11
sa(dp6715
g2
VI offered you an entire crop of beans.
p6716
sg4
I8
sa(dp6717
g2
VOh, right, to build defensive fortifications for your army, which he doubled in size, by the way. Surprise, surprise.
p6718
sg4
I19
sa(dp6719
g2
VI did not cheat!
p6720
sg4
I4
sa(dp6721
g2
VI had to do something to protect the people of Geldar from you.
p6722
sg4
I13
sa(dp6723
g2
VI did not stalk her. We dated\u2026twice. Theresa Geldar. Very cute blonde. I always used to think her name reminded me of some kind of a\u2026mythological land: the kingdom of Geldar.
p6724
sg4
I31
sa(dp6725
g2
VPositioned directly above the continent. Perfect grid. Ten-by-ten. Should have a visual on one of them\u2026
p6726
sg4
I16
sa(dp6727
g2
VHuh. And active. It's transmitting a tremendous amount of data.
p6728
sg4
I10
sa(dp6729
g2
VThis is amazing!
p6730
sg4
I3
sa(dp6731
g2
VYes, well, the\u2026Renaissance obviously came early to these folks.
p6732
sg4
I9
sa(dp6733
g2
V(low, to Sheppard) Like what?
p6734
sg4
I5
sa(dp6735
g2
VYes, well, uh\u2026this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and I'm\u2026McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay.
p6736
sg4
I17
sa(dp6737
g2
VThe Oracle?
p6738
sg4
I2
sa(dp6739
g2
VAh, and you communicate through that.
p6740
sg4
I6
sa(dp6741
g2
VIt's the satellites! They must be tracking everything that's going on and then relaying it via subspace back to Atlantis. It's remarkable!
p6742
sg4
I22
sa(dp6743
g2
VNo, it's obviously some kind of, uh, Ancient experiment, uh, social development, to try out different ways to create civilizations.
p6744
sg4
I20
sa(dp6745
g2
VOh.
p6746
sg4
I1
sa(dp6747
g2
V(nonplussed) Really, that's great.
p6748
sg4
I4
sa(dp6749
g2
VYes. Yes! I mean, this is quite an achievement.
p6750
sg4
I9
sa(dp6751
g2
V(disdainfully) Oh, your guy.
p6752
sg4
I4
sa(dp6753
g2
VEh, it figures.
p6754
sg4
I3
sa(dp6755
g2
V(snidely) Let me guess, he told you to double the size of your army.
p6756
sg4
I14
sa(dp6757
g2
VI didn't cheat!
p6758
sg4
I3
sa(dp6759
g2
V(quickly) Look, look, please sit.
p6760

VAs soon as we input the instructions into our console, they are\u2026relayed back to this device by a number of satellites in orbit over your planet. Once you've carried out the instructions, the satellites transmit the real-time results back to us on our homeworld.

I44
sa(dp6767

VNo\u2026no. Uh-uh, well\u2026we thought it was a game, but, uh\u2026
p6768
sg4
I10
sa(dp6769
g2
VAn imposition, maybe\u2026and a benevolent one at that! I mean, if you could've seen the villages now compared to the way they were when we started\u2014
p6770
sg4
I26
sa(dp6771
g2
VRight. Shall we?
p6772
sg4
I3
sa(dp6773
g2
VSo\u2026this is Geldar, and this is Hallona. Look, two weeks ago I instructed you to start digging a well for the new settlement on the eastern slope, and\u2026look here. (typing on computer) There, see? Construction's already begun.
p6774
sg4
I37
sa(dp6775

VIt's like he said, everything we did, every instruction we gave was to better conditions for your people.
p6776

p6780

I3
sa(dp6781
g2
VWell then, if you, uh, if you need anything at all\u2026don't hesitate to ask, okay? You hungry? 'Cause-cause, we could, uh, walk across to the mess hall. They've got, um, I think it's, uh, salisbury steak today? It's very good. They have-they have a gravy they put on the-on the steak part, and, uh\u2026
p6782
sg4
I54
sa(dp6783
g2
VWell, they-they obviously made the right choice.
p6784
sg4
I7
sa(dp6785
g2
V(contrite) Yeah. Sorry about that. So\u2026it's like I said though, I\u2026I did what I did with the best of intentions.
p6786
sg4
I20
sa(dp6787
g2
VNo! No-no. It is not about winning or losing. Look, the information I gave you and your people is very real, very useful! I've set you on a course that will allow you to develop into a-into a modern society. I mean, where were you two years ago, huh? You were a primitive, disparate cluster of villages stalled in development. Now you're making dirigibles! Do you have any idea how momentous that is?
p6788

g2
V(surprised) Really? Nola seemed very agreeable.
p6796

I6
sa(dp6797
g2
VYeah, well more agreeable than "Richard the Lionheart".
p6798
sg4
I8
sa(dp6799
g2
VListen, you need to make peace with the people of Hallona. If-if tensions keep rising like this, it could lead to war.
p6800
sg4
I22
sa(dp6801
g2
VWell, then you're also aware that people will get hurt.
p6802
sg4

sa(dp6803
g2
V(preening) Huh. Well\u2026
p6804
sg4
I3
sa(dp6805
g2
VNola, you and your people need to start thinking for yourselves. Look, I'm not going to be there for you anymore. You need to-to take control of your own lives, start making your own decisions about your future. And there can be no future without peace.

V(sighing) Hmm.
p6812
sg4
I2
sa(dp6813
g2
V(blithely) Don't worry about it, they'll work it out. Look, we just happened to catch them at a particularly bad time. Sheppard's guy's been doing a lot of aggressive posturing of late.

V(defensively) The coal resources straddle the border between my country and his.
p6818
sg4
I12
sa(dp6819
g2
VIt has been a point of contention between us, okay? But it is just a-a difference in cartographic interpretation. "To-may-to, to-mah-to."

VYou gave me no choice! You refused to negotiate!

p6832

VWell, there's no casualties reported. Looks like the mine was surrendered without a fight.
p6834
sg4
I14

g2
VOh, no. No-no-no. You need to put a stop to that.
p6836
sg4
I11
sa(dp6837
g2
VLook, we just need to step back and reassess the situation here, okay? We should be thinking about easing tensions, not inflaming them!

I23
sa(dp6839

VWhat?
p6840
sg4
I1
sa(dp6841
g2
VYes. Look, listen to me, you cannot engage them!
p6842
sg4
I9
sa(dp6843

VLook, I agree, but you've got to give Sheppard some time. He'll call off the army.
p6844

V(over radio) Sheppard, come in.
p6846

p6848
sg4

V(into radio, impatient) Your army is still on the march!
p6850
sg4
I10
sa(dp6851
g2
V(over radio) Look, they're headed to one of my villages. You need to call them off before they\u2014
p6852
sg4
I18
sa(dp6853
g2
VWhat? No-no-no-no. That can't be right.
p6854
sg4
I6
sa(dp6855
g2
VWell, they retreated without any kind of a fight. What kind of army is that?
p6856
sg4
I15
sa(dp6857

p6858
sg4

p6862
sg4
I4
sa(dp6863
g2
VWhat counterattack?
p6864
sg4
I2
sa(dp6865
g2
VWait\u2026a bomb? You actually built a bomb?!
p6866
sg4
I7
sa(dp6867
g2
VHow come I didn't know about this?
p6868
sg4
I7
sa(dp6869
g2
VHow are you going to deliver it, huh? I mean, the-the catapult couldn't possibly reach that far.
p6870
sg4
I17
sa(dp6871
g2
VOh, no. No-no-no-no-no. Come back!
p6872
sg4
I5
sa(dp6873
g2
VNo! I mean\u2026not specifically. Look\u2026okay\u2026maybe I provided them with the list of ingredients\u2026but\u2026
p6874
sg4
I13
sa(dp6875
g2
VEnough to take out an entire village?
p6876
sg4
I7
sa(dp6877
g2
VI tried that! It's already on the way!
p6878
sg4
I8
sa(dp6879
g2
V(weakly) Dirigible?
p6880
sg4
I2
sa(dp6881
g2
VI did not cheat! Look, nowhere in the rules did it specifically outlaw the development of flying machines, only the\u2026degree and speed of technological advancement.
p6882
sg4
I25
sa(dp6883
g2
V(checking watch) Yes. Yes, I think so.
p6884
sg4
I7
sa(dp6885

V(upset) I am. Really, I just-I wish it didn't lead to this.
p6886
sg4
I12
sa(dp6887

VHe-he just\u2026punctured it. It sank harmlessly to the ground.
p6888
sg4
I9
sa(dp6889
g2
VWhat, you have more?
p6890
sg4
I4
sa(dp6891
g2
VSo I gotta get Nola to call off the attack.
p6892
sg4
I10
sa(dp6893
g2
VHow about a little encouragement, huh? You know, a "go get 'em, Rodney? I have faith in you?"
p6894
sg4
I18
sa(dp6895
g2
VOkay, whatever. Look, I am not giving up on these people. Which means until we get them to call this war off, then we are staying put right here!

p6900

p6902

g2
VUh\u2026nowhere? No, we were just upstairs.
p6904
sg4
I6
sa(dp6905
g2
VWhat? No. That's ridiculous. How could we vanish?
p6906
sg4
I8
sa(dp6907
g2
V(fiercely) Okay, listen to me! For two years now, I have been the Oracle to your people. I have given you much wisdom and guidance and-and bestowed much of my knowledge. Look, it's like you said, I was a god!
p6908
sg4
I40
sa(dp6909
g2
VAnd yes, yes, I may just be a man, but that wisdom still remains! And now, more than ever, you need to heed my guidance and call back those ships!
p6910
sg4
I30
sa(dp6911
g2
VRight\u2026?
p6912
sg4
I1
sa(dp6913

V(into radio) Sheppard, come in! Sheppard! (to others) The radio's dead.
p6916

p6918

VWe're trapped!
p6922

I2
sa(dp6923

V(into radio) Yeah. We hear you. We'll give you a call when we're ready to be picked up.
p6924
sg4
I18
sa(dp6925

VSee, we were beamed up earlier to our ship, the Daedalus, in\u2026orbit over your planet.
p6926
sg4
I15
sa(dp6927
g2
VNo, no one was hurt, no one was killed\u2014all just part of the simulation.
p6928
sg4
I14
sa(dp6929
g2
V(sighing) I'm sorry that we had to do that. But you needed to see how this could end.
p6930
sg4
I18
sa(dp6931
g2
VWell, it's about time.
p6932
sg4
I4
sa(dp6933

VYeah, don't worry, we're going to stick to Chess from now on.
p6934

p6938

sa(dp6939
g2
VWhat? Wh-wh-whoa, no-no-no-no. What happened there?
p6940

VNo, no, I was distracted. She was\u2026Okay, we're going again. Best of ten.
p6942
sg4
I13
sa(dp6943
g2
VWhat? We just got here!
p6944
sg4
I5
sa(dp6945
g2
VWe can't know that until we've explored deeper into the station.
p6946
sg4
I11
sa(dp6947
g2
V(caustically) Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, we hollowed out a lot of moons back in the sixties.
p6948
sg4
I17
sa(dp6949
g2
VWhat about that shuttle, huh? You know, the one we saw when we docked?
p6950
sg4
I14
sa(dp6951
g2
VAh, see? Even you were intrigued.
p6952
sg4
I6
sa(dp6953
g2
VBuilding a place like this inside a moon must've taken tremendous resources. Whoever built it, must've had a damn good reason. And if we want to find out what that reason is, we need to look further inside.
p6954
sg4
I38
sa(dp6955
g2
VWait, wait, wait, wait! "I need to find out what's inside. I'm the same way with Christmas presents and pinatas. One more compartment, other side of this door.
p6956
sg4
I28
sa(dp6957
g2
VLooks like some kind of control room.
p6958
sg4
I7
sa(dp6959
g2
VHeh, heh, heh. Intrigued?
p6960
sg4
I4
sa(dp6961
g2
VIt looks like some kind of rudimentary computer system, but it's locked up. Let me see if I can reboot it\u2026get power online.
p6962
sg4
I23
sa(dp6963
g2
VOh, it's definitely powered by a reactor, and\u2026I just increased its power output.
p6964
sg4
I13
sa(dp6965
g2
V(unrepentant) You said you wanted to take a closer look at that shuttle.
p6966
sg4
I13
sa(dp6967
g2
VEh, well you were thinking it. Besides, I'll have life support online in no time. Closing outer doors\u2026
p6968
sg4
I18
sa(dp6969
g2
VSo we can re-pressurize the hangar, so we can get out of these suits.
p6970
sg4
I14
sa(dp6971
g2
VHey, we can't stop now. We just cracked open the pinata!
p6972
sg4
I11
sa(dp6973
g2
VI'm picking up an energy spike from one of the other compartments.
p6974
sg4
I12
sa(dp6975
g2
V(puzzled) Now it's gone.
p6976
sg4
I4
sa(dp6977
g2
VNot good. There's something frighteningly familiar about that energy signature. Check your life signs detector again.
p6978
sg4
I16
sa(dp6979
g2
VI recognized the energy signature. It's very similar, virtually identical to Wraith beaming technology. I-I-I think he was automatically reintegrated when life support systems started up.
p6980
sg4
I26
sa(dp6981
g2
VAnd the artificial gravity.
p6982
sg4
I4
sa(dp6983
g2
VYeah, well, I'll need to take a closer look, but I am pretty sure that that device is modified Wraith technology. Probably from a crashed dart. If you think about it, it's actually a brilliant fusion of\u2014
p6984
sg4
I37
sa(dp6985
g2
VWell, I don't know. I didn't think that far ahead.
p6986
sg4
I10
sa(dp6987
g2
VMmm, more like centuries. I mean, there's nothing down there but ruins and plant life.
p6988
sg4
I15
sa(dp6989
g2
VUnfortunately, the computer froze. It was completely locked up. You probably should've used a Mac.
p6990
sg4
I15
sa(dp6991
g2
VYou used Wraith beaming technology for long-term storage? That's crazy! Well, the energy patterns couldn't possibly stay stable that long.
p6992
sg4
I20
sa(dp6993
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard, I'm getting another power spike. What's going on?
p6994
sg4
I11
sa(dp6995
g2
VAnother life sign just appeared on the shuttle's HUD. (he spots Jamus) Oh. Hi. I'm McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay. I was the one who powered up your station.
p6996
sg4
I28
sa(dp6997
g2
V(awkwardly) And\u2026you're welcome.
p6998
sg4
I3
sa(dp6999
g2
V(smugly) One that, no offense, is better than that, uh, shuttle you've got there? We could get you back down to the planet and restoring your civilization in no time.
p7000
sg4
I30
sa(dp7001
g2
VWell, if you want a hand with the, uh, control room, I could um\u2026
p7002
sg4
I14
sa(dp7003
g2
VOr maybe not.
p7004
sg4
I3
sa(dp7005
g2
V(distracted) Oh, he's not doing so good, is he?
p7006
sg4
I9
sa(dp7007
g2
VWhat is he doing?
p7008
sg4
I4
sa(dp7009
g2
V(over radio) Herick, what are you doing?
p7010
sg4
I7
sa(dp7011
g2
V(panicked) Sheppard, you need to get Herick out of that shuttle, now!
p7012
sg4
I12
sa(dp7013
g2
V(over radio) Herick, if you're doing what I think you're do\u2014
p7014
sg4
I11
sa(dp7015
g2
VHe's fired the engines! Hang on!
p7016
sg4
I6
sa(dp7017
g2
V(into radio) The outer doors won't hold! You need to shut the hatches to your compartments! All of them!
p7018
sg4
I19
sa(dp7019
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard, Ronon, come in!
p7020
sg4
I6
sa(dp7021
g2
V(despairing, over radio) Sheppard, Ronon\u2026come in.
p7022
sg4
I6
sa(dp7023
g2
V(relieved) Huh! I was pretty sure you were dead!
p7024
sg4
I9
sa(dp7025
g2
VAccording to the readings in here, your compartment was almost completely vented Look, it took almost a minute to re-pressurize.
p7026
sg4
I20
sa(dp7027
g2
VHerick just killed himself and tried to take us with him. Chances are, he succeeded too. I watched him open the rear hatch of the shuttle before he fired the main engines.
p7028
sg4
I32
sa(dp7029
g2
V(sarcastic) You know, I never really got to know him, so uh\u2026
p7030
sg4
I12
sa(dp7031
g2
VThe compartments between us are in vacuum. They're possibly damaged by the explosion. We're cut off from each other!
p7032
sg4
I19
sa(dp7033
g2
VLook, just give me a second to figure out how screwed we are, and I'll get back to you.
p7034
sg4
I19
sa(dp7035
g2
V(over radio) Okay, time for the "how screwed we are" report.
p7036
sg4
I11
sa(dp7037
g2
VThere's no way to seal the compartments between us from here. You know, there's too many hatches left open. Herick was obviously trying to vent the station to space. Look, I'm going to suit up\u2014see what I can do.
p7038
sg4
I39
sa(dp7039
g2
VOh, ho, ho. But I'm not finished yet. Because the shuttle was attached and exhausted all of its fuel during the burn, the moon has been knocked out of its orbit.
p7040
sg4
I31
sa(dp7041
g2
VBefore we burn up, or before we suffocate? Because the reactor scrammed and shut down during all this, so we're down to emergency power, most of which is being channeled into the people storage device.
p7042
sg4
I35
sa(dp7043
g2
VNot done yet. Cause there's still the fact that the jumper was blasted out of the docking port so there's no way off this rock in either case.
p7044
sg4
I28
sa(dp7045
g2
VWell, we don't have much time left. The moon was already in a low orbit to start with. We're beginning to skim the outer atmosphere. We're going to slow down exponentially.
p7046
sg4
I31
sa(dp7047

VShould I just repeat everything I just told you?
p7048

p7068
sg4
I6
sa(dp7069

VI'm sorry, I mean as we..get rescued. I always get those two confused.
p7072
sg4
I13
sa(dp7073
g2
VIf anyone's counting, we have another problem. I can't seal the compartments between us because one of the hatches won't shut.
p7074
sg4
I21
sa(dp7075
g2
VLooks like the entire bulkhead was twisted when Sammy Suicide decided to fire up his rocket ship.
p7076
sg4
I17
sa(dp7077
g2
V(annoyed) Yes, I know that. I am the one who told you. I'll try.
p7078
sg4
I14
sa(dp7079
g2
V(drily, over radio) Yay, faint hope.
p7080
sg4
I6
sa(dp7081
g2
V(straining with effort) Busy working right now. Call back later.
p7082
sg4
I10
sa(dp7083
g2
V(resigned) Yeah, well what is it?
p7084
sg4
I6
sa(dp7085
g2
VNo. No, there's not a chance. Look, the internal batteries would run out in half the time it would take me to patch in a compatible power source. Look, maybe, maybe if I could keep it in the compartment, but, uh, we're not sticking around that long. We're in a decaying orbit, remember?
p7086
sg4
I53
sa(dp7087
g2
VWhat?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I said no.
p7088
sg4
I11
sa(dp7089
g2
VWhat are you\u2014Oh, okay. Er, yeah, tell him no problem. The more the merrier.
p7090
sg4
I14
sa(dp7091
g2
V(straining) Come on! Close! Come on.
p7092
sg4
I6
sa(dp7093
g2
VWhat the\u2026?
p7094
sg4
I2
sa(dp7095
g2
V(relieved) Oh thank god! I can't get the hatch shut! I can't Sheppard, Ronon or Teyla out of the compartments until I get the hatch shut.
p7096
sg4
I26
sa(dp7097
g2
VNo. No, we don't leave our people behind.
p7098
sg4
I8
sa(dp7099
g2
VRight. You're right.
p7100
sg4
I3
sa(dp7101
g2
V(over radio) Not much. We're getting dangerously close to the planet's atmosphere. The moon won't survive another orbit.
p7102
sg4
I18
sa(dp7103
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard, what's going on? I'm picking up another power surge.
p7104
sg4
I12
sa(dp7105
g2
VI have no idea how to determine who's who in this thing. Look, maybe if I had a few hours\u2026
p7106
sg4
I20
sa(dp7107
g2
VYes, I know. But short of randomly beaming people out one-by-one\u2026?
p7108
sg4
I11
sa(dp7109
g2
V(tightly) I am aware of that!
p7110
sg4
I6
sa(dp7111
g2
VYes, but I've already told you there's no way I can rig up a compatible power source for the jumper.
p7112
sg4
I20
sa(dp7113
g2
VWhat?
p7114
sg4
I1
sa(dp7115
g2
VOh, no, no, no, no, no.
p7116
sg4
I6
sa(dp7117
g2
VLook, I know how much you love to think you can fly anything, but it is not\u2014
p7118
sg4
I17
sa(dp7119
g2
VAll right, you're all set. Once you're inside the shuttle, it should be fairly easy to get the device into the receptacle.
p7120
sg4
I22
sa(dp7121
g2
VJust\u2026can I say one more thing?
p7122
sg4
I6
sa(dp7123
g2
VDon't do this, it's impossible.
p7124
sg4
I5
sa(dp7125
g2
V(anguished) Yeah, how you going to pay up if I win, huh?
p7126
sg4
I12
sa(dp7127
g2
V(despondent) Yeah.
p7128
sg4
I2
sa(dp7129
g2
VThe moon's decelerating in the upper atmosphere. You've only got a few minutes to familiarize yourself with those controls.
p7130
sg4
I19
sa(dp7131
g2
VWe're going to lose radio contact as you pass through the atmosphere.
p7132
sg4
I12
sa(dp7133
g2
V(emotional) No, but, I'm saying that\u2026if you have anything that you'd like to say, now would be a good time to\u2014
p7134
sg4
I21
sa(dp7135
g2
VNow would probably be a good time to disengage.
p7136
sg4
I9
sa(dp7137
g2
VHopefully the explosive bolts will throw him clear of the moon.
p7138
sg4
I11
sa(dp7139
g2
VIf he can't separate the ship, he's going to burn up inside the moon.
p7140
sg4
I14
sa(dp7141
g2
VThere it is!
p7142
sg4
I3
sa(dp7143
g2
VNot yet. Wait.
p7144
sg4
I3
sa(dp7145
g2
VI'm detecting one life sign.
p7146
sg4
I5
sa(dp7147
g2
VYou know, technically, I-I didn't take that bet.
p7148
sg4
I8
sa(dp7149
g2
VYou know. I think I am a pretty easy guy to work for. I am usually too busy doing all the really important stuff to micro-manage all the little things I need you people to be doing. Now, because of that, you have a fair amount of freedom. That does not, however, mean you can do whatever the hell you please. There are rules, there are protocols in place, not only to protect this city, but your sorry little existences.
p7150
sg4
I80
sa(dp7151
g2
VOh, no, you cannot. You cannot interrupt me, okay? I was having a perfectly wonderful dream before I got this call, so you can just stand there and listen. You were sent on a routine cataloging of one of the abandoned Ancient labs, and you activate some alien device without having the first clue what it was?
p7152
sg4
I57
sa(dp7153
g2
V(interrupting) Yes! Well, you thought wrong.
p7154
sg4
I6
sa(dp7155
g2
VBut I am me. If I make a mistake, I can fix it. You are you, and when you make mistakes, you don't have to fix them. I do.
p7156
sg4
I29
sa(dp7157
g2
VSo what? What, you want a medal? Look, my four-year-old niece could figure out to turn something off if it was emitting radiation. That does not make you smart; that just makes you a little less stupid.
p7158
sg4
I37
sa(dp7159
g2
VSo? Are they going to live? More importantly, can I go back to bed?
p7160
sg4
I14
sa(dp7161
g2
VWell, you were lucky, because we are in a place where something as simple as flipping a switch could domino out into thousands of people dying. You need to be more careful. (toning down his ire) Okay, just\u2026take tomorrow off, all right?
p7162
sg4
I42
sa(dp7163
g2
V(worried) It is? Already?
p7164
sg4
I4
sa(dp7165
g2
V(muttering) Oh, great.
p7166
sg4
I3
sa(dp7167
g2
VKatie? Hello? Katie?
p7168
sg4
I3
sa(dp7169
g2
VThere you are.
p7170
sg4
I3
sa(dp7171
g2
VHey, it's your day off. What are you doing here?
p7172
sg4
I10
sa(dp7173
g2
V(blithely) Ah\u2026so what? They're ferns.
p7174
sg4
I5
sa(dp7175
g2
VOh\u2026which is to say, you know, you need time off, just-just like everyone else does.
p7176
sg4
I15
sa(dp7177
g2
V(impressed) What? These guys? Really?
p7178
sg4
I5
sa(dp7179
g2
VOh, I do, with Beckett. That's, um, that's kind of why I'm here.
p7180
sg4
I13
sa(dp7181
g2
VYeah, I need, um, an excuse to break those plans.
p7182
sg4
I10
sa(dp7183
g2
VWell, because we're going fishing. Yeah, and to be honest, I cannot think of a more torturous way of spending a day than, you know, up to my\u2026hips in water trying to get worms on hooks and, uh, having all the time in the world to listen to Carson's many views on what I'm sure are a vast number of impossibly boring subjects. I mean, it is unappealing in\u2026every way.
p7184
sg4
I70
sa(dp7185
g2
VWell, because he said "You want to go fishing next month?" It sounded so far away, I figured something would come up, I'd be able to get out of it, but, uh, here we are, a month later, and, uh\u2026
p7186
sg4
I40
sa(dp7187
g2
VExactly. So I figured if I told him we finally had an afternoon where I could, uh, take you out to lunch or\u2026something, then he'd have no choice but to let me out of it.
p7188
sg4
I35
sa(dp7189
g2
VRight. Well\u2026if I had a nickel for every time a girl used that line\u2026
p7190
sg4
I14
sa(dp7191
g2
V(inspired) You know what? Let me bring lunch to you. We can eat here.
p7192
sg4
I14
sa(dp7193
g2
VHey, in the battle between ferns versus fish, ferns continuously win a decisive victory.
p7194
sg4
I14
sa(dp7195
g2
VGreat. Okay. I\u2019ll, um\u2026be right back.
p7196
sg4
I6
sa(dp7197
g2
VHmm.
p7198
sg4
I1
sa(dp7199
g2
VYes. Um. About that.
p7200
sg4
I4
sa(dp7201
g2
VLook\u2026here's the thing. You know I would love to go with you.
p7202
sg4
I12
sa(dp7203
g2
VI would. I do. I just, um\u2014I ran into Katie Brown, and, uh, she started to lay the guilt on, you know, how I never get to see her and how the one day I get off, I'm jet-setting off to the coast to, uh, sport-fish with my best buddy. I mean, she and I see so little of each other, I'm not sure we even count as a couple. Anyways, look. Um, long story short\u2026
p7204
sg4
I76
sa(dp7205
g2
VI told Katie I would spend the day with her.
p7206
sg4
I10
sa(dp7207
g2
VHey, you know if it was anybody else\u2026
p7208
sg4
I8
sa(dp7209
g2
VYeah, next week. I'm-I'm one hundred percent there.
p7210
sg4
I8
sa(dp7211
g2
VAbsolutely.
p7212
sg4
I1
sa(dp7213
g2
VAnd it's still early, so I'm sure you'll find someone else to go with you.
p7214
sg4
I15
sa(dp7215
g2
VMm. Will do.
p7216
sg4
I3
sa(dp7217
g2
V(to himself) Yes!
p7218
sg4
I3
sa(dp7219
g2
VHmm!
p7220
sg4
I1
sa(dp7221
g2
VIt is, yes.
p7222
sg4
I3
sa(dp7223
g2
V(nervously) Oh? Huh. Why's that?
p7224
sg4
I5
sa(dp7225
g2
VI did not.
p7226
sg4
I3
sa(dp7227
g2
VYes, well\u2026it was a-a little weird there for a bit.
p7228
sg4
I10
sa(dp7229
g2
VIt's funny, you know. As much as I hate to admit it, seeing my little sister so happy with her\u2026family, I-I just, uh\u2026well, it kind of made me realize that, uh\u2026well\u2026I'd like to get married.
p7230
sg4
I35
sa(dp7231
g2
VOh, no, not to you.
p7232
sg4
I5
sa(dp7233
g2
VOh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Not not to you.
p7234
sg4
I14
sa(dp7235
g2
V(speaking over her) Look, I was just\u2014 I mean\u2014no, no, no, that was not a proposal. I was just-I was just talking.
p7236
sg4
I22
sa(dp7237
g2
VYou know what I mean? I just don't want you to get the wrong\u2014 It's not that I wouldn't be interested in-in-in getting married to someone- I mean, someone like you\u2026 I mean, someone just like you\u2026you, even, maybe, one day. I just, uh\u2014
p7238
sg4
I44
sa(dp7239
g2
VI like you a lot. I mean, I do.
p7240
sg4
I9
sa(dp7241
g2
VI know. And to be honest, I-I-I find that just\u2026 baffling.
p7242
sg4
I11
sa(dp7243
g2
VNo, no, no, it's other people too. They find it baffling, too.
p7244
sg4
I12
sa(dp7245
g2
VYeah, but you see, that's what scares me. I mean, at some point, you're going to know me the way they know me\u2014
p7246
sg4
I23
sa(dp7247
g2
VI am really sorry that I ignored you all that time.
p7248
sg4
I11
sa(dp7249
g2
VI don't know. Look, I got to go.
p7250
sg4
I8
sa(dp7251
g2
V(over radio) Zelenka, do you read?
p7252
sg4
I6
sa(dp7253
g2
V(over radio) You're all going to want to see this.
p7254
sg4
I10
sa(dp7255
g2
VAll right. I'm digesting this as I go, so, uh, forgive the rough edges.
p7256
sg4
I14
sa(dp7257
g2
VNow, last night, Dr. Hewston and her partner, Dr. Watson, were cataloging a new Ancient lab we uncovered. They\u2026inadvertently activated this machine\u2026 Now, it started to emit a very odd type of radiation, but they were able to turn it off right away. Now, Doctor Beckett examined them that night and gave them a clean bill of health, so with no immediate "apparent" danger, we, um, decided to figure out what the device was, uh, well, whenever we had time. That was a mistake.
p7258
sg4
I84
sa(dp7259
g2
VWell, the science of it is, uh, well, it\u2019s spectacularly complicated, but, um, it appears to be a weapon\u2014one created by the Ancients to battle the Wraith, and one that was abandoned fairly early on as it affected everyone in proximity, including Ancients and humans.
p7260
sg4
I45
sa(dp7261
g2
VAh, well, long story short: it creates\u2026explosive tumors.
p7262
sg4
I8
sa(dp7263
g2
VYeah, I wish. It's actually quite ingenious. Look, the device emits millions of irradiated particles that have been genetically programmed to enter into our systems and gather behind the lungs. Now, as they go, they collect trace elements from our body that they need to, um, complete an explosive compound, which, once in place, the tumor reaches critical mass\u2026and explodes.
p7264
sg4
I60
sa(dp7265
g2
V(interrupting) Has almost definitely been exposed, yes, look, we need to find him before the tumor ignites, which could be any minute now.
p7266
sg4
I23
sa(dp7267
g2
VNext week, I am there.
p7268
sg4
I5
sa(dp7269
g2
VAbsolutely.
p7270
sg4
I1
sa(dp7271
g2
VAnd besides it's still early. I'm sure you'll find someone else to go with you.
p7272
sg4
I15
sa(dp7273
g2
VYeah. Will do.
p7274
sg4
I3
sa(dp7275
g2
VOuch.
p7276
sg4
I1
sa(dp7277
g2
VLong story short\u2026it creates explosive tumors.
p7278
sg4
I6
sa(dp7279
g2
VI-I wish I was.
p7280
sg4
I4
sa(dp7281
g2
VHas almost definitely been exposed, yes. Look, we need to find him before that tumor ignites, which could be any minute now.
p7282
sg4
I22
sa(dp7283
g2
V(over intercom) Dr. Watson, Dr. James Watson, report your whereabouts immediately.
p7284
sg4
I11
sa(dp7285
g2
V(into radio) He's in the O.R. right now? I need you to get Beckett back on his radio.
p7286
sg4
I18
sa(dp7287
g2
V(into radio, panicked) Carson! The man you are working on right now has been infected with an explosive tumor. We think it's what killed Hewston and caused the explosion.
p7288
sg4
I29
sa(dp7289
g2
VIt is possible, Carson. Look, you need to get you and your team out of there. Sheppard has an ordnance disposal crew on the way.
p7290
sg4
I25
sa(dp7291
g2
VHe doesn't have to move. You do.
p7292
sg4
I7
sa(dp7293
g2
V(into radio) Carson, you cannot seriously be considering operating on this guy.
p7294
sg4
I12
sa(dp7295
g2
VThere is no way to know for sure. Look, Hewston was infected at the same time that Watson was, and her tumor's already exploded.
p7296
sg4
I24
sa(dp7297
g2
VOkay, look, this is all very brave and all, but\u2014
p7298
sg4
I10
sa(dp7299
g2
VExactly!
p7300
sg4
I1
sa(dp7301
g2
VThe man is already dead!
p7302
sg4
I5
sa(dp7303
g2
VYeah, but that'll take half an hour. Look, if he's not done removing it by then, then\u2014
p7304
sg4
I17
sa(dp7305
g2
V(swallowing) Hey.
p7306
sg4
I2
sa(dp7307
g2
VHmm\u2026uh\u2026not really.
p7308
sg4
I2
sa(dp7309
g2
V(somberly) No. No, I'm almost done. He didn't have a lot of stuff here.
p7310
sg4
I14
sa(dp7311
g2
VYeah. Well, I mean, we-we will. They don't know yet. We're going to send, uh\u2026 the body back to Earth, and, uh\u2026I'm going to tell his mother\u2026 I should have just gone fishing with him.
p7312
sg4
I35
sa(dp7313
g2
VNo, if I'd gone fishing, if I had checked the machine, if I hadn't assigned two junior guys to catalog the lab\u2014
p7314
sg4
I22
sa(dp7315
g2
V(voice breaking) I know\u2026and, uh\u2026that's what's killing me.
p7316
sg4
I8
sa(dp7317
g2
VIt was, um\u2026it was awful. Your family was amazing, though.
p7318
sg4
I10
sa(dp7319
g2
VOh, packed the church.
p7320
sg4
I4
sa(dp7321
g2
VIt's not going to be the same around here without you.
p7322
sg4
I11
sa(dp7323
g2
VYou know\u2026the universe is a big place. Who knows? Maybe we'll\u2026bump into each other again.
p7324
sg4
I15
sa(dp7325
g2
VYou were the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. I'm really, really sorry. I should have just\u2014
p7326
sg4
I20
sa(dp7327
g2
VYou're just telling me what I want to hear.
p7328
sg4
I9
sa(dp7329
g2
V(voice breaking) Goodbye, Carson.
p7330
sg4
I4
sa(dp7331
g2
V(unhappy) Aw, come on. Don't know why I have to do this.
p7332
sg4
I12
sa(dp7333
g2
V(annoyed) What?
p7334
sg4
I2
sa(dp7335
g2
VWell, you don't have to, do you? Look, it's not my fault things are hard to find on the bottom of the ocean.
p7336
sg4
I23
sa(dp7337
g2
VI said I knew its last known location. It is a mobile drilling station, remember? Obviously that\u2019s going to take a few hours.
p7338
sg4
I23
sa(dp7339
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh, zing.
p7340
sg4
I3
sa(dp7341
g2
V(preening) Mmm. Finally, a voice of reason. Thank you, Doctor, um\u2026
p7342
sg4
I11
sa(dp7343
g2
V(absently) Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.
p7344
sg4
I10
sa(dp7345
g2
V(surprised) Really?
p7346
sg4
I2
sa(dp7347
g2
V(uncomfortable) Oh. It's been that long, has it? Time certainly flies.
p7348
sg4
I11
sa(dp7349
g2
VYou know what? Shut up.
p7350
sg4
I5
sa(dp7351
g2
VHey! I don't hear Grayson complaining.
p7352
sg4
I6
sa(dp7353
g2
VWhat? You sure?
p7354
sg4
I3
sa(dp7355
g2
VNo, no, no, 'cause I could've sworn that the guy I wanted for your department was called Grayson, because I remember thinking "Dick Grayson," Bruce Wayne's ward.
p7356
sg4
I27
sa(dp7357
g2
VHuh. Wonder if that means I hired the wrong guy.
p7358
sg4
I10
sa(dp7359
g2
V(to Weir) All systems are online and functioning at full capacity.
p7360
sg4
I11
sa(dp7361
g2
VWell, no, but we probably could if we wanted to.
p7362
sg4
I10
sa(dp7363
g2
VYes, well, fair enough.
p7364
sg4
I4
sa(dp7365
g2
V(patronizing) We did a complete lifesigns scan. It was the first thing we did when we stepped aboard this station. Look, I promise you, there is nobody here but us.

VWell, maybe it's the pressure. It\u2019s been known to do things to the mind.
p7368
sg4
I14
sa(dp7369
g2
VThere. All of these lifesigns have been accounted for. Humored?
p7370
sg4
I10
sa(dp7371
g2
VThere is no Wraith here, I'm telling you!
p7372
sg4
I8
sa(dp7373
g2
VAs opposed to irrefutable fact?
p7374
sg4
I5
sa(dp7375
g2
VI never said that they did.
p7376
sg4
I6
sa(dp7377
g2
V(into radio) What do you mean, what's going on?
p7378
sg4
I9
sa(dp7379
g2
V(into radio) What?
p7380
sg4
I3
sa(dp7381
g2
V(into radio) Huh. You're right.
p7382
sg4
I5
sa(dp7383
g2
V(into radio) We just lost power to forty percent of the station. Sensors are currently off-line. Zelenka, what're you doing?
p7384
sg4
I20
sa(dp7385
g2
VHave you lost power where you are?
p7386
sg4
I7
sa(dp7387
g2
V(into radio) No.
p7388
sg4
I3
sa(dp7389
g2
V(over radio) You know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few millennia. We're bound to blow a few fuses.
p7390
sg4
I23
sa(dp7391
g2
V(continuing into radio) Look, I'll have power back online in a minute. Just hang tight.
p7392
sg4
I15
sa(dp7393
g2
V(over radio) No, negative. Internal sensors are out, but I have determined the location where the power went down.
p7394
sg4
I19
sa(dp7395
g2
V(into radio) It's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.
p7396
sg4
I10
sa(dp7397
g2
V(over radio) It's the deck that Ronon and Teyla were exploring.
p7398
sg4
I11
sa(dp7399
g2
V(into radio) Okay. (to Dickenson) Davidson.
p7400
sg4
I6
sa(dp7401
g2
V(impatiently) Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark. Just give me a break here. Look, get back to the jumper, see if you can use its sensors to determine the location of our people within the drilling platform.
p7402
sg4
I38
sa(dp7403
g2
VGraydon, you go with him.
p7404
sg4
I5
sa(dp7405
g2
VThere you are.
p7406
sg4
I3
sa(dp7407
g2
VOh, yes, let's race towards the gunfire.
p7408
sg4
I7
sa(dp7409
g2
V(shocked) What? W-Why?
p7410
sg4
I3
sa(dp7411
g2
VWell, that doesn't make any sense. What's she doing?
p7412
sg4
I9
sa(dp7413
g2
VAs far from the "quo" as it gets. Look, Teyla didn't just shut down several key systems. She scrambled the existing operating codes.
p7414
sg4
I23
sa(dp7415
g2
VThe station's communication system is just gone. I can't even patch it. She's blown the control crystals, and shut down half the power to the station, and set up a series of emergency force fields.
p7416
sg4
I35
sa(dp7417
g2
V(over radio) Dickenson. Any progress on disabling those force fields? I'm getting indications that some of them are going up and down, and we could really use the jumper's sensors.
p7418
sg4
I30
sa(dp7419
g2
V(annoyed) I don't know, maybe on a ship nearby.
p7420
sg4
I9
sa(dp7421
g2
VLook, who knows? Teyla\u2019s Spidey sense works for miles. Look, are the external sensors up and running?
p7422
sg4
I17
sa(dp7423
g2
VIt doesn't matter. Coleman, take a look at the drilling platform's external sensors. See what you turn up.
p7424
sg4
I18
sa(dp7425
g2
VAnything.
p7426
sg4
I1
sa(dp7427
g2
V(surprised, into radio) The two guys I just sent back to the jumper.
p7428
sg4
I13
sa(dp7429
g2
V(into radio) We're working on it.
p7430
sg4
I6
sa(dp7431
g2
V(over radio) Yeah, yeah, yeah, al-almost there.
p7432
sg4
I7
sa(dp7433
g2
V(into radio) The jumper's sensors should be able to locate them.
p7434
sg4
I11
sa(dp7435
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard, this is McKay. What have you got? Sheppard, can you hear me?
p7436
sg4
I15
sa(dp7437
g2
V(into radio, worried) Is something wrong?
p7438
sg4
I6
sa(dp7439
g2
V(over radio, panicking) Sheppard, this is McKay. Please respond! Sheppard, come in.
p7440
sg4
I12
sa(dp7441
g2
VYou were thrown by the force of the water clear of the force field bulkhead.
p7442
sg4
I15
sa(dp7443
g2
VEveryone else is accounted for. Any sign of Dickenson?
p7444
sg4
I9
sa(dp7445
g2
VLook, I don't know what just happened, but we are now cut off from the jumper.
p7446
sg4
I16
sa(dp7447
g2
VI should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't have happened.
p7448
sg4
I10
sa(dp7449
g2
VI'm the one who sent those men back to the jumper.
p7450
sg4
I11
sa(dp7451
g2
VWhat?
p7452
sg4
I1
sa(dp7453
g2
V(into radio) Guys, head back here. I think I have a few answers.
p7454
sg4
I13
sa(dp7455
g2
VIt seems completely buried in silt.
p7456
sg4
I6
sa(dp7457
g2
VYes, give or take a "very."
p7458
sg4
I6
sa(dp7459
g2
V(interrupting) Is deadly to humans, but she's not human, remember?
p7460
sg4
I10
sa(dp7461
g2
VHow's Teyla?
p7462
sg4
I2
sa(dp7463
g2
VOkay, well, it looks like the Ancients chose this section of the ocean floor because the planet's crust is remarkably thin right below us, allowing them to drill directly into the magma and maximize the geothermal power output.
p7464
sg4
I38
sa(dp7465
g2
VNo, no, the news is that if they were to detonate, say, the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser on just such a wafer-thin crust\u2014
p7466
sg4
I24
sa(dp7467
g2
VYeah, the initial explosion will be magnified a thousand times. We're talking catastrophic.
p7468
sg4
I13
sa(dp7469
g2
VThey'd never even see it coming.
p7470
sg4
I6
sa(dp7471
g2
VThat's brilliant, but we still need to get there.
p7472
sg4
I9
sa(dp7473
g2
VEven if they've left already, I mean, the moment we were overdue\u2026
p7474
sg4
I12
sa(dp7475
g2
V(inspired) I have an idea.
p7476
sg4
I5
sa(dp7477
g2
VI found these in the database when we first got here. They were used primarily to make repairs to the exterior of the station.
p7478
sg4
I24
sa(dp7479
g2
VYeah, you should be able to traverse the distance between here and the, uh, cruiser.
p7480
sg4
I15
sa(dp7481
g2
VUh, yes, of course. We.
p7482
sg4
I5
sa(dp7483
g2
VRight.
p7484
sg4
I1
sa(dp7485
g2
VForgive me for being aware of exactly how much pressure is being exerted on this suit right now.
p7486
sg4
I18
sa(dp7487
g2
VThat's supposed to make me feel better?
p7488
sg4
I7
sa(dp7489
g2
VI am walking as fast as I can.
p7490
sg4
I8
sa(dp7491
g2
VYeah, well, I probably won't be able to disarm the self-destruct in time anyway, so we're really not in a rush.
p7492
sg4
I21
sa(dp7493
g2
VYou know, this ship is remarkably preserved.
p7494
sg4
I7
sa(dp7495
g2
VI'm serious. Hull damage is minimal. They probably just lost their main drive.
p7496
sg4
I13
sa(dp7497
g2
VWell, I'd have to assess damage to the primary systems, but it's not completely out of the question. Of course, you'd probably just go and blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or something, and all that work would be for nothing.
p7498
sg4
I45
sa(dp7499
g2
VThis way.
p7500
sg4
I2
sa(dp7501
g2
VHmm.
p7502
sg4
I1
sa(dp7503
g2
VWell, I'm pretty sure this is the device, and I'm pretty sure it says we have less than half an hour.
p7504
sg4
I21
sa(dp7505
g2
V(puzzled) Hmm.
p7506
sg4
I2
sa(dp7507
g2
VIt's not accepting commands of any kind. There must be some kind of a-a command code that needs to be entered first.
p7508
sg4
I22
sa(dp7509
g2
V(sarcastic) Yes, well, command codes are usually quite simple, like the number "one" or the letter "A," like, in Wraith, which would be, um\u2014
p7510
sg4
I24
sa(dp7511
g2
VNo! Not if I stood here and tried for a million years, and we have, uh,(checking his watch) \u2026just under a million years less than that.
p7512
sg4
I26
sa(dp7513
g2
V(panicking) She's not dying according to plan here!
p7514
sg4
I8
sa(dp7515
g2
VOf course not. I just had to wait for her to disable the device. Hey, just be thankful she didn't feed on you before she entered the command code.
p7516
sg4
I29
sa(dp7517
g2
VNo, no, no, no, you had to be bait, because she was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the ship.
p7518
sg4
I23
sa(dp7519
g2
VShe is dead, right?
p7520
sg4
I4
sa(dp7521
g2
V(pleased) Well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up. Turns out Atlantis had sent another jumper. It should be here within the hour.
p7522
sg4
I22
sa(dp7523
g2
VHmm.
p7524
sg4
I1
sa(dp7525
g2
VWhat? No, no, no. We haven't finished what we came here for. Look, Wraith's gone. We've got a ton of research to do.
p7526
sg4
I23
sa(dp7527
g2
VIn fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come up with a way to get auxiliary power online in a couple of days.
p7528
sg4
I25
sa(dp7529
g2
V(weakly) Uh\u2026 No?
p7530
sg4
I3
sa(dp7531
g2
VUh\u2026
p7532
sg4
I1
sa(dp7533
g2
V(voice a whisper) Thanks.
p7534
sg4
I4
sa(dp7535
g2
VReally?
p7536
sg4
I1
sa(dp7537
g2
V(disappointed) Oh.
p7538
sg4
I2
sa(dp7539
g2
VWhat do you want?
p7540
sg4
I4
sa(dp7541
g2
VWhat happened to them?
p7542
sg4
I4
sa(dp7543
g2
VAh, so send a MALP.
p7544
sg4
I5
sa(dp7545
g2
V(annoyed) What?
p7546
sg4
I2
sa(dp7547
g2
V(whimpering) Right.
p7548
sg4
I2
sa(dp7549
g2
VThey've gotten a lot done in the short time they've been here.
p7550
sg4
I12
sa(dp7551
g2
VWell, it looks like they abandoned the place.
p7552
sg4
I8
sa(dp7553
g2
VOh. I got something. A single lifesign.
p7554
sg4
I7
sa(dp7555
g2
VIt's below us.
p7556
sg4
I3
sa(dp7557
g2
VQuite a way below us.
p7558
sg4
I5
sa(dp7559
g2
VWell, someone is.
p7560
sg4
I3
sa(dp7561
g2
VIt's a pod.
p7562
sg4
I3
sa(dp7563
g2
VWe're closer.
p7564
sg4
I2
sa(dp7565
g2
VForty meters? It's stopped moving, so we're gaining ground.
p7566
sg4
I9
sa(dp7567
g2
VOh, my God.
p7568
sg4
I3
sa(dp7569
g2
VLooks disturbingly familiar.
p7570
sg4
I3
sa(dp7571
g2
VThe Iratus bug.
p7572
sg4
I3
sa(dp7573
g2
VThat explains why the wounds look so familiar.
p7574
sg4
I8
sa(dp7575
g2
VLet's hope it's the only bug they brought.
p7576
sg4
I8
sa(dp7577
g2
VI doubt the Taranans did this to themselves.
p7578
sg4
I8
sa(dp7579
g2
VOh\u2026our little friend is on the move. It's headed right for us.
p7580
sg4
I12
sa(dp7581
g2
VVery fast.
p7582
sg4
I2
sa(dp7583
g2
VIt stopped.
p7584
sg4
I2
sa(dp7585
g2
VHow am I supposed to know?
p7586
sg4
I6
sa(dp7587
g2
VWell, I think it's out in the tunnel.
p7588
sg4
I8
sa(dp7589
g2
V(whispering) It's close.
p7590
sg4
I3
sa(dp7591
g2
VWhat the hell was that thing?
p7592
sg4
I6
sa(dp7593
g2
VWell, maybe it'll bleed to death.
p7594
sg4
I6
sa(dp7595
g2
VIt's still moving away from us.
p7596
sg4
I6
sa(dp7597
g2
VYeah, and how are we going to do that? Huh? Am I the only one who noticed that our bullets had no effect on it?
p7598
sg4
I25
sa(dp7599
g2
VYou did say "radio silence."
p7600
sg4
I5
sa(dp7601
g2
VIt's through that doorway.
p7602
sg4
I4
sa(dp7603
g2
VPods.
p7604
sg4
I1
sa(dp7605
g2
VYeah, well, they must've found another way out, because it is still on the move.
p7606
sg4
I15
sa(dp7607
g2
V(annoyed) And then systematically killed the entire crew, one by one. Thank you for bringing that up.
p7608
sg4
I17
sa(dp7609
g2
VYeah\u2026I believe the word is "disgusting."
p7610
sg4
I6
sa(dp7611
g2
V(panicked) Go! Go! Go! Go! Sheppard! They're hatching!
p7612
sg4
I8
sa(dp7613
g2
VShut the door. Shut the door!
p7614
sg4
I6
sa(dp7615
g2
VI think you singed my eyebrows. Think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?
p7616
sg4
I13
sa(dp7617
g2
VI think we got them all.
p7618
sg4
I6
sa(dp7619
g2
VExcept for our armless friend. He's still on the move.
p7620
sg4
I10
sa(dp7621
g2
VIt almost killed all of us.
p7622
sg4
I6
sa(dp7623
g2
VNot if they didn't make it to the settlement. This thing only has a range of a hundred meters.
p7624
sg4
I19
sa(dp7625
g2
VWait a minute. It's back that way.
p7626
sg4
I7
sa(dp7627
g2
VI did. Well, it was, but it must have-must've doubled back.
p7628
sg4
I11
sa(dp7629
g2
VI like this plan. I mean, if we're taking a vote.
p7630
sg4
I11
sa(dp7631
g2
VIncluding the airshafts.
p7632
sg4
I3
sa(dp7633
g2
VIf by "human" you mean clad in a grotesquely proportioned exoskeleton, yes, very human.
p7634
sg4
I14
sa(dp7635
g2
VWhich is, as we know, exactly how the Wraith evolved. The Iratus bug bites human, human DNA mixes with theirs, a thousand years go by\u2014Wraith.
p7636
sg4
I25
sa(dp7637
g2
VIt doesn't work that way with the Wraith, all right? At least, we don't think it does. We're not entirely sure as to the Wraith's reproductive methods.
p7638
sg4
I27
sa(dp7639
g2
VAnyway\u2026 look. It's probably less likely they were trying to create another Wraith than they were actually trying to create some kind of a hybrid creature, probably to use as a weapon.
p7640
sg4
I32
sa(dp7641
g2
VMaybe they went back to Atlantis.
p7642
sg4
I6
sa(dp7643
g2
VIf that thing took them all out, then that is one nasty bug\u2026person.
p7644
sg4
I13
sa(dp7645
g2
VRight.
p7646
sg4
I1
sa(dp7647
g2
VNo.
p7648
sg4
I1
sa(dp7649
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
p7650
sg4
I9
sa(dp7651
g2
VThe control crystal's missing.
p7652
sg4
I4
sa(dp7653
g2
VThis is not a matter of fixing, okay? The crystal is just gone. Someone has removed it to prevent anyone else from dialing out.
p7654
sg4
I24
sa(dp7655
g2
VShe's right. We can set up a\u2014 a\u2014what do you call it? A-a-a perimeter. Wait it out.
p7656
sg4
I17
sa(dp7657
g2
VNo. No, I've still just got the one reading. He's still on the move, heading, uh\u2014 No! No, I'm picking up another lifesign. It's popped up out of nowhere.
p7658
sg4
I29
sa(dp7659
g2
VWell, maybe. That, or-or part of this settlement is shielded.
p7660
sg4
I10
sa(dp7661
g2
VThey're close.
p7662
sg4
I2
sa(dp7663
g2
VTeyla!
p7664
sg4
I1
sa(dp7665
g2
VWhere'd she go?
p7666
sg4
I3
sa(dp7667
g2
VI'm reading two lifesigns moving away from us, but one floor up, I think, that, or more air shafts.
p7668
sg4
I19
sa(dp7669
g2
VWait! They disappeared.
p7670
sg4
I3
sa(dp7671
g2
VThe lifesigns, they just vanished. I was right, part of the settlement must be shielded.
p7672
sg4
I15
sa(dp7673
g2
VWait, no, we won't be able to track them!
p7674
sg4
I9
sa(dp7675
g2
VYou need to aim for the stomach area. It seems to be more vulnerable. It's a soft underbelly. You were able to kill it when you hit it there before.
p7676
sg4
I30
sa(dp7677
g2
VI don't know. It's not showing me anything. It's useless.
p7678
sg4
I10
sa(dp7679
g2
VMust be some kind of security lockdown. Whoever took Teyla no doubt triggered it.
p7680
sg4
I14
sa(dp7681
g2
VWhat happened?
p7682
sg4
I2
sa(dp7683
g2
VWhoa. Serious energy spike.
p7684
sg4
I4
sa(dp7685
g2
VWe've probably just entered the shielded section of the settlement.
p7686
sg4
I10
sa(dp7687
g2
VOh, my god.
p7688
sg4
I3
sa(dp7689
g2
VOh, it sounds like bugs.
p7690
sg4
I5
sa(dp7691
g2
VPlease, I-I just thought I could recalibrate it to take into effect the\u2014
p7692
sg4
I13
sa(dp7693
g2
VHe's alive?
p7694
sg4
I2
sa(dp7695
g2
VMaybe I should check out these workstations. There might be some intel\u2026
p7696
sg4
I12
sa(dp7697
g2
V(continuing, insistent) \u2026such as how many of these creatures he created, and if they have any weaknesses that we might be able to exploit.
p7698
sg4
I24
sa(dp7699
g2
VCan't. Shielded, remember? Look, the energy spike, it fouls with radio communications as well.
p7700
sg4
I14
sa(dp7701
g2
VIt is amazing how much work he's been able to get done in such a short amount of time. He's quite the industrious little fella\u2026or Wraith\u2026 or whatever. What does he look like now? I mean, is he full-on Wraith again?
p7702
sg4
I41
sa(dp7703
g2
VYou would think that the human side of him would temper his aggression a bit.
p7704
sg4
I15
sa(dp7705
g2
VWell, certainly less aggressive than\u2014 Oh, sarcasm. Yeah. Nice.
p7706

I9
sa(dp7707
g2
VEh, you're preaching to the choir, my dear.
p7708
sg4
I8
sa(dp7709

VHe had a family?

VA very smart Wraith.
p7712
sg4
I4
sa(dp7713
g2
VSure. Probably. Why not? One of their very best, I would wager.
p7714
sg4
I12
sa(dp7715
g2
VRight. Wait a minute.
p7716
sg4
I4
sa(dp7717
g2
VI think I just figured out how to disable the EM interference that is causing the shielding. (into radio) Sheppard, you there?
p7718
sg4
I22
sa(dp7719
g2
VI got the shielding disabled.
p7720
sg4
I5
sa(dp7721
g2
VAny luck finding Michael?
p7722
sg4
I4
sa(dp7723
g2
VOh. Of course.
p7724
sg4
I3
sa(dp7725
g2
VOh, my god.
p7726
sg4
I3
sa(dp7727
g2
VI am reading a ton of lifesigns near you.
p7728
sg4
I9
sa(dp7729
g2
VA few dozen? I mean, they're all bunched together.
p7730
sg4
I9
sa(dp7731
g2
VWhatever they are, someone just released them, and they're headed your way.
p7732
sg4
I12
sa(dp7733
g2
V(into radio) Keep going, straight up the tunnel. Ronon should be coming around the corner towards you\u2026now.
p7734
sg4
I17
sa(dp7735
g2
V(afraid) It's one of the bugs?
p7736
sg4
I6
sa(dp7737
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard, the creatures are closing in on you fast. You better get moving.
p7738
sg4
I15
sa(dp7739
g2
V(over radio) All right.
p7740
sg4
I4
sa(dp7741
g2
VRope climbing's the reason I got bronze instead of silver in the ParticipAction program.
p7742
sg4
I14
sa(dp7743
g2
VWait!
p7744
sg4
I1
sa(dp7745
g2
VLifesigns up ahead.
p7746
sg4
I3
sa(dp7747
g2
VDoesn't sound like it. Lifesigns behind us, too. It's closing in fast. Oh, god.
p7748
sg4
I14
sa(dp7749
g2
VWe're surrounded.
p7750
sg4
I2
sa(dp7751
g2
VWe barely made it ourselves. We had to commandeer a Wraith dart just to dial out.
p7752
sg4
I16
sa(dp7753
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh yeah, fly, shimmy, spin like a top. You didn't think it'd be hard, did you?
p7754
sg4
I17
sa(dp7755
g2
VSo far, we can't get the ship to respond to anything but the most basic commands.
p7756
sg4
I16
sa(dp7757
g2
VReally. Look, all the more sophisticated systems, like navigation, respond to Wraith neural interface in much the same way that the puddle jumpers can be only controlled by people with the ATA genes.
p7758
sg4
I33
sa(dp7759
g2
VI'm working on a manual override! I just haven't had much luck yet.
p7760
sg4
I13
sa(dp7761
g2
VIt's worth a try, but that's not the only problem. At least half of the ship's power generating capacity is gone.  So even if I had access to spare parts, which I don't, I doubt I could fix it. Now, if we're gonna fly this thing and hope for weapons, we need to cut down on our curent power consumption.
p7762
sg4
I60
sa(dp7763
g2
VMeaning the two hundred prisoners we've got in stasis? Well, we can't keep them in there forever.
p7764
sg4
I17
sa(dp7765
g2
V(deadpan) Oh, she feels hungry too? Hmm?
p7766
sg4
I7
sa(dp7767
g2
VAnd that was just flying in a straight line. I mean, she'll never be able to pull of anything complex, like, uh, combat maneuverability, weapons control, uh\u2026
p7768
sg4
I27
sa(dp7769
g2
VWell, does, um, standing still count as a maneuver?
p7770
sg4
I9
sa(dp7771
g2
V(nodding to Woolsey) Hmm. (low, sarcastic to Sheppard) Thanks.
p7772
sg4
I9
sa(dp7773
g2
VLong range sensors just picked up a hive ship.
p7774
sg4
I9
sa(dp7775
g2
VNo. Wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.
p7776
sg4
I9
sa(dp7777
g2
VOn it's current course, it's heading straight for the planet where we left Beckett and the prisoners.
p7778
sg4
I17
sa(dp7779
g2
VThere is no reason for the Wraith to be interested in that planet. It doesn't have a Stargate, and there's no indication that it ever supported a human population. It is completely off the grid.
p7780
sg4
I35
sa(dp7781
g2
VTwo days. Well, we could, uh, well, you could beat them there in the Daedalus.
p7782
sg4
I15
sa(dp7783
g2
VOh, we'd be cutting it close.
p7784
sg4
I6
sa(dp7785
g2
VIf I can get the manual interface working, I'd say\u2026less than slim?
p7786
sg4
I12
sa(dp7787
g2
VSort of.
p7788
sg4
I2
sa(dp7789
g2
VWell, we can fire, but, uh, not in any particular direction.
p7790
sg4
I11
sa(dp7791
g2
VOh believe me, no one wants to survive this mission more than I do. Look, we're using up a lot of our power reserves to maintain this speed. We're not gonna have a lot left over to fight with.
p7792
sg4
I39
sa(dp7793
g2
VYeah, theoretically.
p7794
sg4
I2
sa(dp7795
g2
VThat's it. We're out of hyperspace.
p7796
sg4
I6
sa(dp7797
g2
VNo, we're clear.
p7798
sg4
I3
sa(dp7799
g2
VAll right, just give me a second.
p7800
sg4
I7
sa(dp7801
g2
VThat's weird. A bunch of secondary systems just came online.
p7802
sg4
I10
sa(dp7803
g2
V(concerned) True. But I didn't do it. It's like they just woke up by themselves.
p7804
sg4
I15
sa(dp7805
g2
VIt looks like they're all keyed into the sensors. The ship must've detected something and turned them on.
p7806
sg4
I18
sa(dp7807
g2
VOh! Wraith life signs.
p7808
sg4
I4
sa(dp7809
g2
VIt's, uh, twenty or thirty.
p7810
sg4
I5
sa(dp7811
g2
VStill well over a hundred.
p7812
sg4
I5
sa(dp7813
g2
VI have no way to distinguish them from the other human life signs. I can't say for sure either way.
p7814
sg4
I20
sa(dp7815
g2
V(into radio) Well, I have no idea. Teyla, what do you think?
p7816
sg4
I12
sa(dp7817
g2
VAnd live some more, hopefully.
p7818
sg4
I5
sa(dp7819
g2
VEverything in a three mile radius is toast.
p7820
sg4
I8
sa(dp7821
g2
VThe blast radius doesn't just stop at three miles.
p7822
sg4
I9
sa(dp7823
g2
VWell, I suppose we could not incinerate them.
p7824
sg4
I8
sa(dp7825
g2
VAw, come on.
p7826
sg4
I3
sa(dp7827
g2
VWhat's happening?
p7828
sg4
I2
sa(dp7829
g2
VUnderstood. Failsafe detonation in\u2026three\u2026two\u2026one\u2026
p7830
sg4
I4
sa(dp7831
g2
V(into comm) I don't understand it!
p7832
sg4
I6
sa(dp7833
g2
V(into comm) You mean, what didn't happen.
p7834
sg4
I7
sa(dp7835
g2
VWe couldn't hit the side of a barn!
p7836
sg4
I8
sa(dp7837
g2
V(clarifying) A giant, flying barn! We couldn't hit that.
p7838
sg4
I9
sa(dp7839
g2
VAll motion in space is relative.
p7840
sg4
I6
sa(dp7841
g2
VWell, that I might be able to do.
p7842
sg4
I8
sa(dp7843
g2
VIt's the other hive! We're taking multiple hits!
p7844
sg4
I8
sa(dp7845
g2
VIt's hard to say for sure how accurate our fire has been!
p7846
sg4
I12
sa(dp7847
g2
VEngines are off-line! We're venting atmosphere! Power's about to fail!
p7848
sg4
I10
sa(dp7849
g2
VTalk about annoying.
p7850
sg4
I3
sa(dp7851
g2
VWe should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
p7852
sg4
I8
sa(dp7853
g2
VI am just saying that identifying potential space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet.
p7854
sg4
I28
sa(dp7855
g2
VThis isn't just about me. It is about the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently\u2026and whenever I want to.
p7856
sg4
I24
sa(dp7857
g2
V(turning in his chair back to Ronon, enthusiastic) Okay, once we've seeded enough Stargates across the void between Pegasus and the Milky Way, we'll be able to take a jumper from one to the other to the other till we reach the other side. That way we won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus, and travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to thirty minutes.
p7858
sg4
I74
sa(dp7859
g2
V(smugly) Yes. (more reluctantly) It was Samantha Carter's idea.
p7860
sg4
I9
sa(dp7861
g2
V(low, to team) Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and\u2026get out of here.
p7862
sg4
I15
sa(dp7863
g2
V(distracted) Eh, it probably wouldn't hurt to, uh, make contact with the locals though, no?
p7864
sg4
I15
sa(dp7865
g2
VNo, no, well we're here now, and uh\u2026
p7866
sg4
I8
sa(dp7867
g2
V(piqued) We don't even know your name.
p7868
sg4
I7
sa(dp7869
g2
VExcuse me, um, Lucius. Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but, uh, what is it exactly about you\u2026
p7870
sg4
I20
sa(dp7871
g2
VMmm.
p7872
sg4
I1
sa(dp7873
g2
VIt's complicated. One has to\u2014
p7874
sg4
I5
sa(dp7875
g2
VOr perhaps not.
p7876
sg4
I3
sa(dp7877
g2
VFor what?
p7878
sg4
I2
sa(dp7879
g2
VObnoxious? Unctuous?
p7880
sg4
I2
sa(dp7881
g2
VThen again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicines.
p7882
sg4
I15
sa(dp7883
g2
V(excited) Yes! Right away.
p7884
sg4
I4
sa(dp7885
g2
VOne lousy 'gate. We're never going to meet our quota at this rate.
p7886
sg4
I13
sa(dp7887
g2
VMy quota.
p7888
sg4
I2
sa(dp7889
g2
VDid you just say gourds?
p7890
sg4
I5
sa(dp7891
g2
VIf what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value to us.
p7892
sg4
I14
sa(dp7893
g2
VOne tiny settlement on the entire planet? Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
p7894
sg4
I16
sa(dp7895
g2
VWhere's Zelenka?
p7896
sg4
I2
sa(dp7897
g2
VWhat did he do to you?
p7898
sg4
I6
sa(dp7899
g2
V(crossing his arms) Herbs and gourds?
p7900
sg4
I6
sa(dp7901
g2
VOh, you're just taking his word for it.
p7902
sg4
I8
sa(dp7903
g2
V(meekly) Me? Uh\u2026no. He might.
p7904
sg4
I5
sa(dp7905
g2
VYeah. It reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually. It's uh, Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman, make him fall in love with her. Ended up doing all sorts of\u2026evil things for her. It was kind of a turn-on, actually. It's Julie Newmar in the cat outfit\u2026
p7906
sg4
I52
sa(dp7907
g2
VNot till season three.
p7908
sg4
I4
sa(dp7909
g2
VYeah. You didn't know that?
p7910
sg4
I5
sa(dp7911
g2
VOh! So, I-I did a little investigating, and\u2026surveillance footage from his quarters.
p7912
sg4
I12
sa(dp7913
g2
VAh. I took the liberty of searching his room. Hmm?
p7914
sg4
I10
sa(dp7915
g2
VThere's some residue from the liquid still in the vial. It'll take some time to break it down\u2026I could have used Carson's help on this, but\u2026
p7916
sg4
I26
sa(dp7917
g2
V(worried) Right.
p7918
sg4
I2
sa(dp7919
g2
V(nonplussed) What is she, nuts?
p7920
sg4
I5
sa(dp7921
g2
V(sighing) Oh, right.
p7922
sg4
I3
sa(dp7923
g2
VI am working on it, but there's not enough of the liquid to work with. I need more.
p7924
sg4
I18
sa(dp7925
g2
VWhat, you're leaving me here alone?
p7926
sg4
I6
sa(dp7927
g2
VYeah, but the place is turning into a nuthouse!
p7928
sg4
I9
sa(dp7929
g2
VYou are a scoundrel, you know? That's what you are.
p7930
sg4
I10
sa(dp7931
g2
VSheppard, come here. You've got to hear this. Lucius was just telling the most hysterical story. You know that they have marmots on his planet? Well, I mean, they're not marmots exactly, but it-it's a rodent very similar to the marmot that\u2026
p7932
sg4
I42
sa(dp7933
g2
VYes, well\u2026I tried to keep to myself, but Lucius here was concerned for me. So, he just came down, Ronon held me against the wall, and Lucius and I had a nice long talk.
p7934
sg4
I34
sa(dp7935
g2
VAnd let me tell you, we have nothing to worry about with this guy. This guy's just a big knucklehead, aren't you, you big knucklehead?
p7936
sg4
I25
sa(dp7937
g2
VTeyla, Ronon, and Beckett. They, uh, volunteered to check out M6H-491.
p7938
sg4
I11
sa(dp7939
g2
VTo disable the DHD, I know. I'm sorry. I didn't. But come on\u2026Ronon and Teyla. I mean, they can handle themselves.
p7940
sg4
I21
sa(dp7941
g2
VOh, he-now he can walk on his hands. Did you know that? Yeah, he was showing Lucius just before he left. You should've seen it. He was down on his hands, he had\u2026
p7942
sg4
I33
sa(dp7943
g2
VOh! We don't know for sure that there are even Wraith on the planet. You know, but we'll find out soon enough though, won't we?
p7944
sg4
I25
sa(dp7945
g2
V(considering) Hmm.
p7946
sg4
I2
sa(dp7947
g2
VThat engages the HUD, stands for Heads Up Display.
p7948
sg4
I9
sa(dp7949
g2
VI can fly it too!
p7950
sg4
I5
sa(dp7951
g2
VIt does not. He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.
p7952
sg4
I13
sa(dp7953
g2
VYou don't even know\u2014
p7954
sg4
I4
sa(dp7955
g2
VYou know what's really interesting? If you look at this down here\u2026
p7956
sg4
I12
sa(dp7957
g2
VWhy is the jumper bay roof opening? Jumper Three's starting up. Who's in it?
p7958
sg4
I14
sa(dp7959
g2
V(into radio) Jumper Three, please identify. Jumper Three, this is Flight! Identify yourself! (to Chuck) Look, close the door.
p7960
sg4
I19
sa(dp7961
g2
VMy computer's missing! A tablet, two drives, all of my research!
p7962
sg4
I11
sa(dp7963
g2
VWe should head back. We've been searching for hours.
p7964
sg4
I9
sa(dp7965
g2
VI don't like being this far away from Atlantis. Lucius is probably worried. Do you think he's worried?
p7966
sg4
I18
sa(dp7967
g2
V(into radio) Is Lucius worried about us?
p7968
sg4
I7
sa(dp7969
g2
VI should've stayed with him.
p7970
sg4
I5
sa(dp7971
g2
VWhat did you shoot him for?
p7972
sg4
I6
sa(dp7973
g2
VAw, now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the jumper.
p7974
sg4
I15
sa(dp7975
g2
VAre you feeling okay? Can I get you anything?
p7976
sg4
I9
sa(dp7977
g2
VAre you sure?
p7978
sg4
I3
sa(dp7979
g2
VBecause it would be no trouble\u2026?
p7980
sg4
I6
sa(dp7981
g2
VRight away.
p7982
sg4
I2
sa(dp7983
g2
V(into radio) Jumper One, this is Flight. The bay doors are open! You are go for launch!
p7984
sg4
I17
sa(dp7985
g2
VWhat is taking him so long? Okay\u2026I should go up there.
p7986
sg4
I11
sa(dp7987
g2
VIt worked!
p7988
sg4
I2
sa(dp7989
g2
V(tearfully) Fly, Lucius. Fly.
p7990
sg4
I4
sa(dp7991
g2
VWell, the townspeople are over their withdrawal and on the mend, so I doubt that will happen.
p7992
sg4
I17
sa(dp7993
g2
VRight.
p7994
sg4
I1
sa(dp7995
g2
VIt was a\u2014one teeny-tiny taste, for research purposes.
p7996
sg4
I8
sa(dp7997
g2
VFine. (under his breath) Story of my life.
p7998
sg4
I8
sa(dp7999
g2
VEh, I always feel like that. Like something horrible's about to happen.
p8000
sg4
I12
sa(dp8001
g2
VI got used to it. Thing is, when someone else also has that feeling, mine gets worse.
p8002
sg4
I17
sa(dp8003
g2
VI also see nothing we might be interested in trading for.
p8004
sg4
I11
sa(dp8005
g2
VI take it he was talking to you?
p8006
sg4
I8
sa(dp8007
g2
V(in a high pitched scream) Aaah! That did not just happened!
p8008
sg4
I11
sa(dp8009
g2
V(screaming) Oh my god! It hurts! I can't feel my leg!
p8010
sg4
I11
sa(dp8011
g2
VBoth!
p8012
sg4
I1
sa(dp8013
g2
VWhat the hell did you do to these people?!
p8014
sg4
I9
sa(dp8015
g2
VHow can you not recognize the 'gate address?!
p8016
sg4
I8
sa(dp8017
g2
VYes, as a matter of fact!
p8018
sg4
I6
sa(dp8019

VOh! Damn it!
p8020
sg4
I3
sa(dp8021
g2
VThey're right behind me.
p8022
sg4
I4
sa(dp8023
g2
V(drunkenly) So many colors! All the pretty horses.
p8024
sg4
I8
sa(dp8025
g2
VHave you seen a guy around? He looks like you, but he's got messy hair. I think I\u2026lost him somewhere\u2026and\u2026and a-and a pretty girl and a caveman.
p8026
sg4
I27
sa(dp8027
g2
VExcuse me, why am I lying here?
p8028
sg4
I7
sa(dp8029
g2
VOh. Well, that sounds painful. (he sighs) Gluteus maxi\u2026mus. Glute\u2014\u2026maaa-xim\u2026Oh my god! That's my ass, isn't it?
p8030
sg4
I17
sa(dp8031
g2
V(rolling his eyes) Of course. If it sounds like it might be impossible, you look at me.
p8032
sg4
I17
sa(dp8033
g2
V(thinking) I might be able to tune the long-range sensors to pick up any similarly generated subspace transmissions.
p8034
sg4
I18
sa(dp8035
g2
VYeah, but\u2026we are still assuming that the Wraith actually put another one in him.
p8036
sg4
I14
sa(dp8037
g2
VI'm here.
p8038
sg4
I2
sa(dp8039

VYou know, you really don't appreciate the simple things in life, like, uh\u2026sitting.
p8040

VDon't worry. I limited the power, so it won't transmit our location to the Wraith. I just needed enough juice to determine the subspace frequency it broadcasts on. And now\u2026I need to re-calibrate the city's long-range sensors to pick up on it.
p8046
sg4
I42
sa(dp8047
g2
V(impatient) Unless they're calibrated to pick up a signal being transmitted using subspace. How about I leave the bad jokes to you, and you leave the brilliant science stuff to me?

I14
sa(dp8073

VYou are just jealous of our relationship.
p8074
sg4
I7
sa(dp8075
g2
V(scoffing) We have an unspoken bond. I mean, there are things that go deeper than words, my friend. Deeper than words. But you wouldn't know anything about that, because you never look past the surface of anyone, do you?

p8078

p8106
sg4
I11
sa(dp8107
g2
VMy idea.
p8108

p8120

p8122
sg4
I28
sa(dp8123

p8128
sg4

VHmm.
p8130

p8132

VAny particular reason?
p8134
sg4
I3
sa(dp8135
g2
V(to Sheppard) Ah, see, he didn't answer my question. (louder, to Niam) I'm sorry, you didn't actually answer my question.
p8136
sg4
I20
sa(dp8137
g2
VWell, the-the power requirements for a city this size must be enormous! Well, plus, uh-uh, shielding from the Wraith, we're talking, what, three zero point modules, maybe four?
p8138
sg4
I28
sa(dp8139
g2
VUm, sorry. ZPMs. Uh, um, uh a device that taps vast amounts of power from vacuum energy?
p8140
sg4
I17
sa(dp8141
g2
V"Exactly" doesn't matter. "Many" is plenty!
p8142
sg4
I6
sa(dp8143

VI assume that you, um, built them yourselves?
p8144
sg4
I8
sa(dp8145
g2
V(giddy) Yes.
p8146
sg4
I2
sa(dp8147
g2
VBut no other information, I might add. Oddly, the database neglected to include any information on a society of millions of Ancients, such as\u2026yourselves.
p8148
sg4
I24
sa(dp8149
g2
VGreat! Let's hear it.

p8152

V(chuckling with false humility) Fortunately, I'm very good with complexity.
p8154
sg4
I10
sa(dp8155
g2
V(annoyed) He says the other Ancients are arrogant?
p8156

I8
sa(dp8157

VYeah, well how many PhDs does he have?
p8158
sg4
I8
sa(dp8159
g2
V"Ancienty?"
p8160
sg4

sa(dp8167
g2
VAre you serious? It's a jail cell!
p8168
sg4
I7
sa(dp8169
g2
VWell, the only way out of here would be to first disable the force field around the bars, which is only accessible from the\u2026

p8174

VOh, no, no. I can't think on an empty stomach!
p8176
sg4
I10
sa(dp8177
g2
V(dryly) I'm sorry, but all your credibility was lost when you locked us up.
p8178
sg4
I14
sa(dp8179
g2
VPreventing the jumper from communicating with the control room. Element of surprise.
p8180
sg4
I12
sa(dp8181
g2
VGo ahead! Dial the 'gate!
p8182
sg4
I5
sa(dp8183

VI've searched a good portion of the database for any indication of the Asurans, but, uh\u2026
p8184
sg4
I16
sa(dp8185
g2
VStill nothing.
p8186
sg4
I2
sa(dp8187
g2
VYeah, but even if they deleted every reference to Asura, you'd think there'd be some hint of\u2026

sg4
I17
sa(dp8189
g2
VHive ships!
p8190

I2
sa(dp8191

VMore importantly, why are we just picking them up now?!
p8192
sg4
I10
sa(dp8193
g2
VI'm already on it. Cloak engaged\u2026now.
p8194
sg4
I6
sa(dp8195
g2
VIt doesn't matter. I'm counting seven ships. There's nothing they could do about it.
p8196
sg4
I14
sa(dp8197
g2
VI can't! The shield generators were hit in the initial blast!
p8198
sg4
I11

p8200

p8202
sg4
I22
sa(dp8203

VNo, no, no, no! I can't let you do this! Not without tossing a coin or something! It doesn't seem right!
p8204

I21
sa(dp8205
g2
VThey're not people. They're machines. Replicators!
p8206
sg4
I6

p8208

VOh, at least you escaped.
p8210

p8212
sg4
I11
sa(dp8213
g2
V(annoyed) I said: "too hideous to recount."
p8214
sg4
I7
sa(dp8215
g2
VWell, there's gotta be a way to know for sure.
p8216
sg4
I10
sa(dp8217

p8218

I20
sa(dp8223
g2
VElizabeth\u2026?
p8224
sg4
I1
sa(dp8225
g2
VWhich is all they needed to begin replicating again.
p8226
sg4
I9
sa(dp8227
g2
VThis is bad. Look, they're very similar to an artificial intelligence that SG-1 encountered several years ago that evolved from a-a tiny block Replicator into human form. They may even be related somehow.
p8228
sg4
I33
sa(dp8229
g2
VOh, which is why I said: "this is bad."
p8230
sg4
I9
sa(dp8231
g2
VWhich means we've probably just identified the race that, uh, created the nanovirus that nearly killed me a couple years ago.
p8232
sg4
I21
sa(dp8233
g2
V(grimacing and nodding) Yeah.
p8234
sg4
I4
sa(dp8235
g2
VThat was different. Those were individual nanites, easy to disrupt with a simple EM pulse. These-these "things" have evolved way beyond that with, uh, interdependent organic constituents of a far greater complexity\u2014
p8236
sg4
I32
sa(dp8237
g2
VMetaphysical debates aside, what do you want from us? We're not exactly ascension experts.
p8238

V(incredulous) "What's the hold up?" Do you have any idea what I'm trying to do here?!
p8250
sg4
I16
sa(dp8251
g2
VOh that is so\u2026relatively accurate.
p8252
sg4
I5
sa(dp8253
g2
VOkay, still, we're not dealing with Rock'Em, Sock'Em Robots here, we are dealing with a complex code of over three billion chemical base sequences. It's like trying to reconfigure the DNA double helix.
p8254
sg4
I33
sa(dp8255

V(rolling his eyes) It will be done when it is done, and you applying pressure is not gonna\u2026

V(rushed) Gotta go. McKay out.
p8258
sg4
I5
sa(dp8259
g2
V(triumphant) Yes, yes, yes! I have removed the aggression directive from the base code. It is uploading to Niam as we speak. But, I discovered something else, nothing short of brilliant, I might add.
p8260
sg4
I34
sa(dp8261
g2
V(excited) Okay, even though these Replicators are each separate functioning beings, their basic command code is interconnected over a powerful subspace frequency. They have these, uh, periodic collective program updates or, uh, merges, they call them, where they exchange new information.
p8262
sg4
I41
sa(dp8263
g2
VExactly. But while I was working on it, I figured out a way to create a glitch that, on my command, should momentarily freeze them.
p8264
sg4
I25
sa(dp8265
g2
VOkay, will. I mean, dead in their tracks, like hitting the pause button. I mean, temporarily, until they\u2026figure out how to override it.
p8266
sg4
I23
sa(dp8267
g2
V(nonplussed) Well, I don't know. That's why I said "momentarily".
p8268
sg4

p8280

sa(dp8281

p8282
sg4
I30
sa(dp8283
g2
V(holding in his irritation) Please. Of course it will work.
p8284
sg4
I10
sa(dp8285
g2
VLook, why do you always have to\u2026? Look, I need to properly calibrate the frequencies. I want to make sure that when I freeze them, I freeze them all, okay?
p8286
sg4
I30
sa(dp8287

VHey! It worked!

g2
VThanks.
p8300
sg4
I1

g2
VDamn.
p8304
sg4
I1
sa(dp8305

p8314

p8316
sg4
I17
sa(dp8317
g2
VNo, no. You don't understand. Look, I didn't want them to be able to stop it. Hey, look, as soon as I trigger the overload, there'll be practically zero lag time before it blows.
p8318
sg4
I34

p8338
sg4
I27

p8344

p8346
sg4
I24
sa(dp8347
g2
VSo they're attempting to assimilate her? To transform her into one of them?
p8348

I13
sa(dp8349
g2

p8350
sg4
I6

p8352

VWhat?
p8356
sg4
I1

p8374
sg4
I26
sa(dp8375
g2
VBut that's all we need! Momentary distraction to draw them away from her, so we can zap 'em with the impulse.

V(excited) Hmm!
p8378
sg4
I2
sa(dp8379

VRender her essentially brain dead, which makes no sense.
p8388

VUh, reality check? There are microscopic robots in her brain! How does she fight that?
p8390

p8404
sg4
I11
sa(dp8405
g2
VThere's a good chance he was transported off-world, so I've gathered the last fifty or so gate addresses that were dialed.
p8406
sg4
I21
sa(dp8407
g2
V(sarcastically) What are you gonna do, like ask the Genii if one of them took Sheppard?
p8408
sg4

g2
VSo\u2026this\u2026?
p8410

g2
VDespite the fact that it was your incompetence that led to his capture.
p8412
sg4
I13
sa(dp8413
g2
VI'm sorry, but there is no disputing the fact that it was a code we provided the Genii that was used to lure us to that planet where we were ambushed!
p8414
sg4
I31
sa(dp8415
g2
VNone, but we're receiving an analog video signal.
p8416

I8
sa(dp8417
g2
VWhat have you done to him?
p8418
sg4
I6
sa(dp8419
g2
VOkay, let me rephrase that. What are you planning to do?
p8420
sg4
I11
sa(dp8421
g2
VWe'll rephrase that, too. We would like him to be able to speak to us.
p8422
sg4
I15
sa(dp8423
g2
V(desperately, through radio) Sheppard could have left you to rot down in that hole when we last met, Kolya. He does not deserve this!
p8424
sg4
I24
sa(dp8425
g2
VAnd you just left Kolya out in the cold.
p8426
sg4
I9
sa(dp8427
g2
VSo, instead you\u2014having what it took\u2014overthrew Cowan yourself.
p8428
sg4
I8
sa(dp8429
g2
VWe can't do that.
p8430
sg4
I4
sa(dp8431
g2
VBecause\u2026 (rethinking) Well\u2026can we?
p8432
sg4
I4
sa(dp8433
g2
VWe have a list of planets where recent Genii activity's been documented, but we'd have a much higher margin of success if Ladon would be willing to point out firm locations of Genii safe houses and shelters, maybe even hidden Wraith-infested torture chambers.
p8434
sg4
I43
sa(dp8435
g2
V(yelling from stairs as he approaches) Doctor Weir! We've got a match! We went through database. Between our list and Ladon's, there's only one potential location that makes any sense.
p8436
sg4
I30
sa(dp8437
g2
VRight.
p8438
sg4
I1
sa(dp8439
g2
V(emphatically) All right, people. Let's do this one by the numbers. We get in, we get our man, we get out. Stay sharp, and stay alive.
p8440

I26

g2
V(abashed) Oh, just things that Sheppard would say, so I just thought I would\u2014
p8442

p8448

VUm\u2026a mouse. A really big one though. Uh, more of a rat really, possibly rabid.
p8450

VAnd we've just wasted two and a half hours.
p8452

V\u2026and a mouse.
p8454

I3
sa(dp8455

VWe don't know that.
p8456

I4
sa(dp8457
g2
VYou know, I have the sinking feeling we've just made a terrible mistake.
p8458
sg4
I13
sa(dp8459
g2
VKolya's late.
p8460
sg4
I2
sa(dp8461
g2
VWe haven't heard anything from Ladon, either.
p8462
sg4
I7
sa(dp8463
g2
VWhat kind of a plan would that be?
p8464
sg4
I8
sa(dp8465
g2
VTrue.
p8466
sg4
I1
sa(dp8467
g2
VNone of us are saying what we're all thinking here.
p8468

p8470
sg4
I11

VWhen it first came up, it was eight, then four\u2026I don't get it. Now, it's just the two.
p8472
sg4
I18
sa(dp8473
g2
VWell, one of them's definitely Sheppard. His subcutaneous transmitter's still broadcasting.
p8474
sg4
I11
sa(dp8475
g2
VWhat?
p8476
sg4
I1
sa(dp8477
g2
V(incredulous) What debt?! Are you kidding? I mean, he looks younger than he did before!
p8478
sg4
I15
sa(dp8479
g2
VYeah, but\u2026
p8480
sg4
I2

p8482
sg4
I3
sa(dp8483
g2
V(preening) Ah. With what?
p8484
sg4
I4
sa(dp8485
g2
VYes, yes. What has my sister done?
p8486
sg4
I7
sa(dp8487
g2
V(impatient) Greetings, salutations, pleasantries\u2026what's she done?
p8488
sg4
I6
sa(dp8489
g2
VHuh. Well, it's certainly some\u2026uh\u2026very interesting stuff. But uh, huh, it can't be her work. I mean, she's been out of the game for years.
p8490
sg4
I25
sa(dp8491
g2
VMmm, yes. She hasn't published a single theoretical physics paper in, like, four years.
p8492
sg4
I14
sa(dp8493
g2
VMmm. She was on the fast track to some, uh, pretty exciting grants, doing some interesting work. I mean, she was no me, of course. But, uh, she was at least a "you."
p8494
sg4
I33
sa(dp8495
g2
VMmm. Anyway\u2026she got herself knocked up by some\u2026"English major", and her priorities shifted overnight. Tried to talk some sense into her, but, uh, she's a tad on the stubborn side.
p8496
sg4
I30
sa(dp8497
g2
VMmm, four years, maybe.
p8498
sg4
I4
sa(dp8499
g2
V(defensively) Not that I didn't check to see if she'd published!
p8500
sg4
I11
sa(dp8501
g2
V(chuckles) Yes, well, if the math checks out.
p8502
sg4
I8
sa(dp8503
g2
VAh, well, no offense, blue eyes, but, um, I'd like a little more time with it, myself.
p8504
sg4
I17
sa(dp8505
g2
V(jealous) Aw, and she said it just came to her?
p8506
sg4
I10
sa(dp8507
g2
VA notion. That is just beautiful. She's gonna love this\u2026wait, you didn't tell her I've been trying to prove something like this myself, did you?
p8508
sg4
I25
sa(dp8509
g2
VOh, good. Because she would just\u2026wait a minute. Why not?
p8510
sg4
I10
sa(dp8511
g2
VHuh. Well, forget her, then. I mean, she's made her choice, we'll just have to you and I figure out how to implement it on our own. Let's see\u2026Now, upon first glance, there are certainly some\u2026missing pieces that aren't exactly spelled out in the proof, but um\u2026What?
p8512
sg4
I47
sa(dp8513
g2
VWell, what do you want me to do? She's not gonna listen to me!
p8514
sg4
I14

g2
VExactly!
p8516
sg4

VAren't you going to invite me in?
p8522

VOh, I can't just stop by, say hi to my little sister?
p8524
sg4
I12
sa(dp8525
g2
VWell, I've been kind of\u2026busy\u2026with work\u2026you know, doing a lot of traveling, and such, and I-I was called back on business, so um\u2026I was in town\u2026and-and I thought I'd um\u2026you know, um\u2026
p8526
sg4
I32
sa(dp8527
g2
VWhat?
p8528
sg4
I1
sa(dp8529
g2
V(defensively) What? No. No-no I-I mean, I'm sure that's part of the reason why I'm here, but, uh\u2014
p8530
sg4
I18
sa(dp8531
g2
VNo! No, I work for a multi-national\u2026er, oversight advisory that, uh\u2026
p8532
sg4
I11
sa(dp8533
g2
VDo you have any idea what you've written?
p8534
sg4
I8
sa(dp8535
g2
VI'll take that action.
p8536
sg4
I4
sa(dp8537
g2
VJust sign the damn agreement!
p8538
sg4
I5
sa(dp8539
g2
VHere we go.
p8540
sg4
I3
sa(dp8541
g2
VBut it has sparked an idea in someone. A big one!
p8542
sg4
I11

VAh! Can't tell you. Not until you sign the agreement.
p8544

V(awkwardly) Hey!
p8546
sg4
I2
sa(dp8547
g2
V(uncomfortable) Uh, hello, little one.
p8548
sg4
I5
sa(dp8549
g2
VWhat? No. I didn't know that was a rule.
p8550
sg4
I9
sa(dp8551
g2
VWell, I guess I broke that rule.
p8552
sg4
I7
sa(dp8553
g2
VUh, that would be great, exactly. I'm starving. You have no idea what time zone I just came from.
p8554
sg4
I19

V(low, to Jeanie) I sure hope he's kidding.
p8556
sg4
I8

p8564
sg4
I6
sa(dp8565
g2
VOkay, look I don't want to waste any more of your time. You-you need to come with me right now! Your-your proof could lead to something\u2026groundbreaking!
p8566
sg4
I26
sa(dp8567
g2
VWell it's like, a couple months, tops.
p8568
sg4
I7
sa(dp8569
g2
VShe's four. How good could she possibly be?
p8570
sg4
I8
sa(dp8571
g2
VHey, she's not gonna remember you not being there.
p8572
sg4
I9
sa(dp8573
g2
VThis is bigger than your-your "responsibilities."
p8574
sg4
I6
sa(dp8575
g2
VThis is not what dad would've wanted.
p8576
sg4
I7
sa(dp8577
g2
VNo, he would've wanted us working together, side by side, toppling problems, and-and sharing credit.
p8578
sg4
I15
sa(dp8579
g2
VThis is important, Jeanie. I mean, it's much more important than you could ever imagine.
p8580

I15

VYou know, you leave me no choice.
p8582

p8588

VHmm, yes, well\u2026
p8592
sg4
I3
sa(dp8593

VOh, yes.
p8594
sg4
I2
sa(dp8595
g2
VWe work for something called the Stargate Program.
p8596
sg4
I8
sa(dp8597
g2
VUh, it's a device that, uh, creates stable artificial wormholes that allows us to travel between other planets, even\u2026other galaxies.
p8598
sg4
I20
sa(dp8599
g2
VIt's a long story.
p8600

VIt's Meredith Rodney McKay, yes. But I prefer to go by "Rodney." Look, can we just stick to the point here? Look out the window\u2014much more interesting than my name.

p8604
sg4
I12

p8614
sg4
I5
sa(dp8615

VWhat?! Do you have any idea what "non-disclosure" means?
p8616
sg4
I9
sa(dp8617
g2
VWell, what did he say?
p8618
sg4
I5
sa(dp8619
g2
VMmm. Probably not.
p8620
sg4
I3
sa(dp8621
g2
VIt's fine.
p8622
sg4
I2
sa(dp8623
g2
VA slight problem. It was the creation of exotic particles in the containment field.
p8624
sg4
I14
sa(dp8625
g2
VIt was uninhabited.
p8626
sg4
I3
sa(dp8627
g2
VWhich would get us around the whole problem of the creation of dangerous exotic particles in our own space-time.
p8628
sg4
I19
sa(dp8629
g2
VAbsurd we can do. We have something called a zero point module which essentially does what we're attempting on a smaller scale\u2014extract energy from subspace time.
p8630
sg4
I26
sa(dp8631
g2
V(chuckling) Well, something like that.
p8632
sg4
I5
sa(dp8633
g2
VHere we go.
p8634
sg4
I3
sa(dp8635
g2
VLook, if it wasn't for my work, your little theory would be useless.
p8636
sg4
I13
sa(dp8637
g2
VAND JEANIE Sorry.
p8638
sg4
I3
sa(dp8639
g2
VWhat?
p8640
sg4
I1
sa(dp8641
g2
VI don't want to scare you, but you need to know the stakes. We're at war.
p8642
sg4
I16
sa(dp8643
g2
VWhat?! No! Come on!
p8644
sg4
I4
sa(dp8645
g2
VOkay, you've got a nota bene by the cosmological constant. Why is that? Jeanie?
p8646
sg4
I14
sa(dp8647
g2
VHey. Yeah. Why you're here, remember?
p8648
sg4
I6
sa(dp8649
g2
VThank you.
p8650
sg4
I2
sa(dp8651
g2
V(pointing on page) So there's your problem, right there.
p8652
sg4
I9
sa(dp8653
g2
VNo I didn't!
p8654
sg4
I3
sa(dp8655
g2
VOkay, so we need a yea or nay on the equations.
p8656
sg4
I11
sa(dp8657
g2
V(voiceover) Atlantis already has a containment chamber we can use. I'll forward the necessary modifications to Zelenka. Now, if he doesn't mess it up, he can make the changes we need before we even get there.
p8658
sg4
I36
sa(dp8659
g2
VNow we've been through these calculations a number of times, and I think we've settled on a containment field setup that should work for us. We just want to show you these\u2026
p8660
sg4
I32
sa(dp8661
g2
VYeah. She's married, and she's my sister.
p8662

p8666
sg4
I7
sa(dp8667
g2
V(annoyed) Yes, we try not to encourage him. He's got a bit of an ego.
p8668
sg4
I15

g2
VIn-chamber conditions are green. Containment field is in the green. Monitors are green.
p8670
sg4
I13

I18
sa(dp8673
g2
VAll right. Here we go.
p8674
sg4
I5
sa(dp8675

VWhy would we do that?
p8676
sg4
I5
sa(dp8677
g2
VWell, there's only room on the button for one finger, so\u2026
p8678
sg4
I11
sa(dp8679
g2
VYeah, but I-I'm right here. So\u2026
p8680

VPowering up to five percent.
p8682

p8712

p8714
sg4
I4
sa(dp8715
g2
VYou saw the math!
p8716
sg4
I4
sa(dp8717
g2
VYeah, well he's here now, so the question is: what does he want?
p8718
sg4
I13
sa(dp8719
g2
V(to Jeanie) All right, you want shared credit? You're coming in with me.
p8720
sg4
I13
sa(dp8721
g2
VHuh.
p8722
sg4
I1
sa(dp8723
g2
VAND ROD For me, too.

sa(dp8725

VRodney.
p8726
sg4

sa(dp8727
g2
V(to Jeanie) I could never get anyone to call me that.
p8728
sg4
I11
sa(dp8729
g2
VNot now!
p8730
sg4
I2
sa(dp8731
g2
V(uncomfortably) Uh, there was a\u2026slight risk, yes?
p8732
sg4
I7
sa(dp8733
g2
V(impatient) Yes. How exactly did you get here?
p8734
sg4
I8
sa(dp8735
g2
VYes, but of course, we would be unable to detect that signal from within the containment chamber.
p8736
sg4
I17
sa(dp8737
g2
V(ruefully) I depleted ours.
p8738
sg4
I4
sa(dp8739
g2
VYou lost!
p8740
sg4
I2
sa(dp8741
g2
VOh. Sure.
p8742
sg4
I2
sa(dp8743
g2
VAlready done. And after hearing what you've told me, I see no reason why we'd start it back up again.
p8744
sg4
I20
sa(dp8745
g2
VAh, well, yes. But how did you plan on getting, you know, back? I mean, to your own universe?
p8746
sg4
I19
sa(dp8747
g2
VAll right, what's the game plan here?
p8748
sg4
I7
sa(dp8749
g2
VSomething more permanent?! Well, we're not keeping him!
p8750
sg4
I8
sa(dp8751
g2
VWell, that just doesn't mean he has to stay here!
p8752
sg4
I10
sa(dp8753
g2
VOh, I see. So he gets his way, and I don't?!
p8754
sg4
I11
sa(dp8755
g2
VHe's not me! I'm me\u2026the\u2026real me.
p8756
sg4
I6
sa(dp8757
g2
VWhat does Elizabeth have to say about all of this?
p8758
sg4
I10
sa(dp8759
g2
VThere aren't two McKays! There's one McKay and\u2026him!
p8760
sg4
I8
sa(dp8761
g2
VNo, but I can blame him for reminding me all the time.
p8762
sg4
I12
sa(dp8763
g2
VHow so?
p8764
sg4
I2
sa(dp8765
g2
VWhat the hell is this?
p8766
sg4
I5
sa(dp8767
g2
VYeah, hi.
p8768
sg4
I2
sa(dp8769
g2
VYes, well how wonderful for him.
p8770
sg4
I6
sa(dp8771
g2
VAND ROD Excuse me.
p8772
sg4
I4
sa(dp8773
g2
VWhat do you mean you started it up again?
p8774
sg4
I9
sa(dp8775
g2
V(accusingly) Mm-hmm.
p8776
sg4
I2
sa(dp8777
g2
VOh, so you're willing to take all of the credit, but none of the blame, huh?
p8778
sg4
I16
sa(dp8779
g2
VIt could travel almost instantaneously. I mean, your universe could just flash out of existence!
p8780
sg4
I15
sa(dp8781
g2
VYeah, yes. Of course. Follow me.
p8782
sg4
I6
sa(dp8783
g2
V(annoyed) Done.
p8784
sg4
I2
sa(dp8785
g2
VWhat were you doing having breakfast with him?
p8786
sg4
I8
sa(dp8787
g2
VYeah, well, I don't want you hanging around with him any more.
p8788
sg4
I12
sa(dp8789
g2
VLook, I am your real brother.
p8790
sg4
I6
sa(dp8791
g2
VOh, what is that supposed to mean?
p8792
sg4
I7
sa(dp8793
g2
V(scoffs) You were making an incredible mistake. I was just trying to\u2014
p8794
sg4
I12
sa(dp8795
g2
VI never stopped being your brother!
p8796
sg4
I6
sa(dp8797
g2
VDon't put all that on me.
p8798
sg4
I6
sa(dp8799
g2
VI was doing top secret research in another galaxy!
p8800
sg4
I9
sa(dp8801
g2
V(hurt, defensive) It wasn't like that at all.
p8802
sg4
I8
sa(dp8803
g2
VHe's slowing me down.
p8804
sg4
I4
sa(dp8805
g2
VYeah, he's not me!
p8806
sg4
I4
sa(dp8807
g2
VHmph. Unless he's lying.
p8808
sg4
I4
sa(dp8809
g2
VWhat if the people on his Atlantis were sick of him messing up all the time, huh? So when it came time to send some stooge on a one-way ticket to another universe, there was only one guy they could do without.
p8810
sg4
I42
sa(dp8811
g2
VOh, really, Mister Mensa in a parallel universe, what is this all about?
p8812
sg4
I13
sa(dp8813
g2
VWhat?! That's crazy! That's\u2026that's\u2026that's possibly true.
p8814
sg4
I6
sa(dp8815
g2
VHuh. Jeanie and I drifted apart. I mean, that happens, I mean, it wasn't done maliciously. Do I have regrets? Yes, of course I do. But who doesn't? I mean, you know, I'm not very good at saying I'm sorry, or that-or that I'm wrong, you know, possibly because it happens so rarely.
p8816
sg4
I53
sa(dp8817
g2
VSo I didn't call, or write, and when I realized that four years had gone by, it was just a\u2026you're right! Of course, you're right. I mean, she has every reason to hate me!
p8818
sg4
I34
sa(dp8819
g2
VWell, she should!
p8820
sg4
I3
sa(dp8821
g2
VYeah, well I do.
p8822
sg4
I4
sa(dp8823
g2
V(distractedly to Sheppard) Good talk. Thanks.
p8824
sg4
I6
sa(dp8825
g2
VWhat's going on?
p8826
sg4
I3
sa(dp8827
g2
V(impatiently) They sent us a message.
p8828
sg4
I6
sa(dp8829
g2
VOh, boy.
p8830
sg4
I2
sa(dp8831
g2
VThey do? That's great!
p8832
sg4
I4
sa(dp8833
g2
VOh boy.
p8834
sg4
I2
sa(dp8835
g2
VWell, to be honest, the science gets extremely complicated. But, um, "simply put", the tear will eventually swallow up the entire galaxy, possibly the universe.
p8836
sg4
I25
sa(dp8837
g2
VWell I think we can all agree that that would be bad, yes.
p8838
sg4
I13
sa(dp8839
g2
VActually, Jeanie has an idea.
p8840
sg4
I5
sa(dp8841
g2
VEverything we've got. I mean, enough to severely deplete our ZPM.
p8842
sg4
I11
sa(dp8843
g2
VYes. We'd still be able to dial Earth, but, uh, much less frequently, of course. And let's just say, I wouldn't be around here if the Wraith show up.
p8844
sg4
I29
sa(dp8845
g2
VYou'd rather the universe was destroyed?
p8846
sg4
I6
sa(dp8847
g2
VI know what you're going to say.
p8848
sg4
I7
sa(dp8849
g2
VYou'd be transported back to your own universe. I know, I didn't bring it up before because if it doesn't work\u2026
p8850
sg4
I21
sa(dp8851
g2
V(protesting) Everyone loves you here!
p8852
sg4
I5
sa(dp8853
g2
VIt's just a lesser model, hmm?
p8854
sg4
I6
sa(dp8855
g2
VOh. People don't like me?
p8856
sg4
I5
sa(dp8857
g2
VOh, I guess you just to, um, click your heels together, huh?
p8858
sg4
I12
sa(dp8859
g2
V(nonplussed) You-you too.
p8860
sg4
I3
sa(dp8861
g2
VHey, I tried to talk him out of it, but you know\u2026Rod.
p8862

VRight, and\u2026
p8864
sg4

g2
VUh\u2026you wanna press the button?
p8866
sg4

p8868

I8
sa(dp8869

VZPM's at fifty percent!
p8870
sg4
I4
sa(dp8871
g2
VThirty percent!
p8872
sg4
I2
sa(dp8873
g2
VNot yet!
p8874
sg4
I2
sa(dp8875
g2
VAccording to these readings, if we shut it down now, he won't make it!
p8876
sg4
I14
sa(dp8877
g2
VAlmost there\u2026.Cut power now!
p8878
sg4
I4
sa(dp8879
g2
V(heartbroken) All of it. I drained all of it.
p8880
sg4
I9
sa(dp8881
g2
VHmm. Well, I suppose I would've done the same thing for\u2026me.
p8882
sg4
I11
sa(dp8883
g2
VI am so fired.
p8884
sg4
I4
sa(dp8885
g2
V(on video) Jeanie\u2026this is your brother\u2026Rodney. I want to s-say\u2026um\u2026family is important. I-I've come to realize that because the people here have become a sort of a, kinda, surrogate family to me. Now, I know what you're thinking. I've never really been the\u2026poster child for that kind of sentiment. But, when-when one's contemplating one's own demise, one tends to see things\u2026more clearly. I really do wish you the best, you know? And I'm sorry we weren't closer. Perhaps, um\u2026if by chance I make it out of this, perhaps one day we can be. And I would like that. Now, if there's time, I'd like to\u2026
p8886
sg4
I105
sa(dp8887
g2
VWhat are you two up to?
p8888
sg4
I6
sa(dp8889
g2
V(unamused) Ah-ha-ha-ha.
p8890
sg4
I2
sa(dp8891
g2
VHey.
p8892
sg4
I1
sa(dp8893
g2
VHey, you should, be, uh, packing. Daedalus leaves in the morning.
p8894
sg4
I11
sa(dp8895
g2
VOh. Um, well, she wasn't too happy about the whole\u2026"killing-the-ZPM". But, um, you know, in the grand scheme of things, we did prevent the destruction of the universe, so\u2026you know\u2026not fired.
p8896
sg4
I31
sa(dp8897
g2
VYeah.
p8898
sg4
I1
sa(dp8899
g2
VOh, right. Uh\u2026got this for Madison.
p8900
sg4
I6
sa(dp8901
g2
VYeah, uh, I swiped it from Weir's desk. It's not like there's a Toys-R-Us nearby. So, uh\u2026
p8902
sg4
I17
sa(dp8903
g2
VYes\u2026about that\u2026
p8904
sg4
I2
sa(dp8905
g2
VWhich is to say\u2026uh\u2026look\u2026what I wanted to\u2026
p8906
sg4
I7
sa(dp8907
g2
VHow are you? You happy? You okay?
p8908
sg4
I7
sa(dp8909
g2
VIntergalactic gate network should be complete soon, so um\u2026maybe it won't be four years next time?
p8910
sg4
I16
sa(dp8911
g2
VIf you can convince Kaleb\u2026not to make Tofurky.
p8912
sg4
I8
sa(dp8913
g2
VAm I just not getting the team e-mails anymore?
p8914
sg4
I9
sa(dp8915
g2
VOh, yes. Well of course you are.
p8916
sg4
I7
sa(dp8917
g2
VWell, it's hard to say, really, but, uh, I doubt he'll be back, though.
p8918
sg4
I14
sa(dp8919
g2
VWhat?
p8920
sg4
I1
sa(dp8921
g2
VReally?
p8922
sg4
I1
sa(dp8923
g2
VWell, uh, he wasn't that bad.
p8924
sg4
I6
sa(dp8925
g2
VI'll be honest with you. That's kind of nice to hear. Now\u2026
p8926
sg4
I12
sa(dp8927
g2
VWhat else has been happening?
p8928
sg4
I5
sa(dp8929
g2
VHardly new, either.
p8930
sg4
I3
sa(dp8931
g2
VMmm. An anomalous spike the MALP picked up on a 'gate scout. The planet is uninhabited, but I thought it warranted a closer look.
p8932
sg4
I24
sa(dp8933
g2
VWe tried contacting them by the radio, but, uh, signal is intermittent at best. It's just a lot of static. It could have something to do with the anomaly, but I'm not sure.
p8934
sg4
I33
sa(dp8935
g2
VI'm picking up that puzzling energy reading.
p8936
sg4
I7
sa(dp8937
g2
V(annoyed) Did I not just use the word "puzzling"?
p8938
sg4
I9
sa(dp8939
g2
VThe readings are stronger. Whatever it is? We're getting warmer.
p8940
sg4
I10
sa(dp8941
g2
V(sarcastic) No. Really?
p8942
sg4
I3
sa(dp8943
g2
VWhat, so they killed each other?
p8944
sg4
I6
sa(dp8945
g2
VEh, according to the Ancient database.
p8946
sg4
I6
sa(dp8947
g2
VProbably. It's be just our luck if we stumbled on one of their nuclear testing sites.
p8948
sg4
I16
sa(dp8949
g2
V(impatiently) Well, what?! Person, animal? How many syllables?
p8950
sg4
I8
sa(dp8951
g2
V(to himself) Why am I not comforted?
p8952
sg4
I7
sa(dp8953
g2
V(whispering) Hey.
p8954
sg4
I2
sa(dp8955
g2
VOh for god's sake, enough with the bodies!
p8956
sg4
I8
sa(dp8957
g2
VEh, another Hardy Boys mystery. In here.
p8958
sg4
I7
sa(dp8959
g2
VJust like the energy conduit aboard a Wraith ship\u2026and every bit of disgusting.
p8960
sg4
I13
sa(dp8961
g2
V(intrigued) Huh, we got power.
p8962
sg4
I5
sa(dp8963
g2
VWell, this is it. Ground zero for the energy readings.
p8964
sg4
I10
sa(dp8965
g2
VApparently so.
p8966
sg4
I2
sa(dp8967
g2
VIt's some sort of\u2026EM generator. It's emitting a modulating ultra-low frequency pulse. These, uh, energy conduits are acting almost like antennae.
p8968
sg4
I21
sa(dp8969
g2
VUh, probably. The Genii must've found this place, activated it somehow, and they couldn't figure out how to turn it off. So, they did whatever any other good "soldier" would do in their situation.
p8970
sg4
I34
sa(dp8971
g2
VHmm.
p8972
sg4
I1
sa(dp8973
g2
VAh, it's the beauty of hybrid organic design.
p8974
sg4
I8
sa(dp8975
g2
VMmm. It's doubtful. Apart from the obvious sterility issues.
p8976
sg4
I9
sa(dp8977
g2
V(noncommittally) Eh.
p8978
sg4
I2
sa(dp8979
g2
VHey! A camera!
p8980
sg4
I3
sa(dp8981
g2
VLook at this.
p8982
sg4
I3
sa(dp8983
g2
V(perplexed) He was calling for the Prometheus. That ship was destroyed last year.
p8984
sg4
I13
sa(dp8985
g2
VI'll check it out.
p8986
sg4
I4
sa(dp8987
g2
VWhat? No. We can't leave. Look, the generator's still running.
p8988
sg4
I10
sa(dp8989
g2
VLook, I have to at least figure out its purpose. They're probably right. It may somehow be linked to all of this.
p8990
sg4
I22
sa(dp8991
g2
VCan we stop for a second?
p8992
sg4
I6
sa(dp8993
g2
V(grunting with effort) Look, I mean no disrespect, but this guy's heavy, and ever since I was shot in the ass by an arrow, I've been prone to sciatica\u2026No?
p8994
sg4
I29
sa(dp8995
g2
VWe are unbelievably screwed.
p8996
sg4
I4
sa(dp8997
g2
V(in disbelief) Huh\u2014
p8998
sg4
I3
sa(dp8999
g2
V(protesting) I wouldn't do that!
p9000
sg4
I5
sa(dp9001
g2
VLook, no. Even if we could somehow manually dial, there's no power. Your pal Major Looney Tunes knew exactly where to set the charge.
p9002
sg4
I24
sa(dp9003
g2
VNo, what we need to do is go back to the bunker.
p9004
sg4
I12
sa(dp9005
g2
VAnd she'll probably only get static, remember? Look, as long as that generator is emitting that pulse, we'll have little if any chance of responding to Atlantis if they radio. No, you want to get out of here? I need to shut that thing down.
p9006
sg4
I45
sa(dp9007
g2
V(compassionately) Hey, you don't worry about me. You just hang in there, okay?
p9008
sg4
I13
sa(dp9009
g2
VTeyla, you want to hold this?
p9010
sg4
I6
sa(dp9011
g2
VYeah, you see right here? According to these readings, if I cut through that membrane, there should be several actuator coils underneath. Well\u2026it's Wraith tech, so it's more like actuator veins. Now if I can isolate the primary conduit, follow it straight back to the core.
p9012
sg4
I46
sa(dp9013
g2
V(petulantly) Definitely not all.
p9014
sg4
I4
sa(dp9015
g2
VActually, very little. Look, I can only surmise that it's some sort of Wraith\u2026experiment.
p9016
sg4
I14
sa(dp9017
g2
VWell, I can now state for certain that it is in fact a generator.
p9018
sg4
I14
sa(dp9019
g2
VLook, the EM pulse it's emitting is-is very peculiar. It-it's fluctuating in-in systematic intervals along the ultra-low frequency.
p9020
sg4
I18
sa(dp9021
g2
VI hope so.
p9022
sg4
I3
sa(dp9023
g2
VOtherwise, there are two bizarre things going on, and one is more than enough for me, thank you very much.
p9024
sg4
I20
sa(dp9025
g2
VUh, I think you're right. I don't think these "antennae" as I have so colorfully put it, have overgrown beyond their intended lengths. It's as if\u2026whoever turned it on, dialed it up to eleven, and just left it there.
p9026
sg4
I39
sa(dp9027
g2
VYeah. The Genii. They must've discovered the place, started messing around with the machine without having the first clue as to what they were doing\u2026which explains why the place is covered in this.
p9028
sg4
I33
sa(dp9029
g2
VThey couldn't figure out how to turn it off, so they shot the thing, hoping they could somehow kill it, which only made it re-grow more, make it that much more difficult for someone with the ability to actually turn it off to actually turn it off.
p9030
sg4
I47
sa(dp9031
g2
V(defensively) I never said that!
p9032
sg4
I5
sa(dp9033
g2
VLook, the control console is shot to hell. As I was telling Teyla, I'll have to bypass it, isolate the primary actuator conduit, and follow it back to the core. Once I cut power to that\u2014
p9034
sg4
I36
sa(dp9035
g2
VYeah, I need to cut through this membrane. It's like surgery. It's more up your alley; maybe you ought to do it.
p9036

sa(dp9041

V(dismissively) So you made a mistake. You thought he was dead, and he wasn't. Better off that way than the other way round.
p9042
sg4
I23
sa(dp9043
g2
VHuh. Well, it could be the effects of the generator. Look, I think I've learned a little more about this "experiment" the Wraith have been conducting. It seems that they're trying to improve their ability to manipulate the minds of their prey.
p9044
sg4
I42
sa(dp9045
g2
VExactly. They're already pretty good at it; they just wanted to get better. But then the Genii dial up the power, send out a massive pulse, which is obviously messing with people's minds, and inciting violence, uh, pulling up traumatic images, and\u2026

p9048

sa(dp9049
g2
VI'm detecting a power surge.
p9050
sg4
I5
sa(dp9051
g2
VWell, that's what we thought. It could be a result of the Genii destroying the control console. Yeah, see, they destabilized any kind of power regulation.

V(distracted) Hmm?
p9054
sg4
I2
sa(dp9055

p9072

VHey, Carson, come on, I need you to concentrate.
p9100

sg4
I7
sa(dp9135
g2
VNot yet, no.
p9136
sg4
I3
sa(dp9137
g2
VBecause subspace communications are down. Don't worry, I got Chuck working on it.
p9138

VPower. We're losing massive amounts of power!
p9144

V(over radio) I don't care where the problem is\u2026
p9146

V(disappointed) Oh\u2026
p9150
sg4
I2
sa(dp9151

V(into radio) All right, that means we'll need to uh\u2014
p9152
sg4
I10
sa(dp9153
g2
V(into radio) I will as soon as I've shut down all the\u2014
p9154
sg4
I12
sa(dp9155
g2
VEvery second I waste, we're draining more power. Just trust me, we're doing the right thing here.
p9156
sg4
I17
sa(dp9157
g2
VLong story short, there are a bunch of systems on right now that don't need to be, and given our current situation, they are draining the life out of the city.
p9158
sg4
I31
sa(dp9159
g2
VYeah, just wait, uh\u2026maybe. Yeah.
p9160
sg4
I5
sa(dp9161
g2
VAw, come on.
p9162
sg4
I3
sa(dp9163
g2
VNothing. Well, the control grid's all out of whack. I can't shut the systems down from here. We're\u2026bleeding out.
p9164
sg4
I19
sa(dp9165
g2
V(panicked) I don't think we have the time.
p9166
sg4
I8
sa(dp9167
g2
VOkay, you're right. You're right. (into radio) Uh, Zelenka, we need to deploy some teams.
p9168
sg4
I15
sa(dp9169
g2
VI don't know. What little power we had night is almost gone. We'll be lucky if we can make it through the night.
p9170
sg4
I23
sa(dp9171
g2
VWhat?
p9172
sg4
I1
sa(dp9173
g2
VWell, I'm sorry. We're a little under the gun here. Things move fast!
p9174
sg4
I13
sa(dp9175
g2
V(contrite) You're in charge. I know. I'm sorry.
p9176
sg4
I8
sa(dp9177
g2
VOkay. Okay, well, I'll give you the, uh, Cole's Notes.
p9178
sg4
I10
sa(dp9179
g2
VUh, the Cliff's Notes?
p9180
sg4
I4
sa(dp9181
g2
VWell\u2026never mind. Look, as we were leaving Lantia, we got grazed by the, uh, Replicators' satellite beam, right? It impacted the side of the tower, and from what we can tell, it wreaked havoc on a number of power conduits.
p9182
sg4
I40
sa(dp9183
g2
VYeah\u2026it's not so easy. Look, the ZPM room's at the base of the tower, which means that the conduits in and around where the beam hit are primary conduits. They can't be\u2026uh, routed around.
p9184
sg4
I34
sa(dp9185
g2
VNo, no, no. The-the conduits weren't severed, they were damaged. Look, it's complicated but\u2026um, imagine them as, uh, leaky pipes, okay?
p9186
sg4
I21
sa(dp9187
g2
VSo, you pump water through them, they leak, right?
p9188
sg4
I9
sa(dp9189
g2
VSorry. Look, the city realizes that, for whatever reason, power's not making it to the outer piers. So, instead of repairing the leaks, which it can't do, it increases the ZPM's output so that even though the pipes are leaky and we lose power, enough energy makes it to the end of the line.
p9190
sg4
I54
sa(dp9191
g2
VNo, that's good. Well, otherwise we'd lose the shields, we'd lose atmosphere, we'd-we'd all be dead.
p9192
sg4
I16
sa(dp9193
g2
VLook, there are a number of systems on right now that don't need to be, and they're screaming for power. Look, we're gonna lose juice, potentially a fatal amount no matter what we do. But, uh, if we can get those nonessential systems shut down, then the ZPM will need to pump less power through the leaky pipes and\u2026we'll be able to put off imminent death for another\u2026hour or so.
p9194
sg4
I70
sa(dp9195
g2
VOh, well, the teams are making good time. Uh, we've got about sixty percent of the nonessential systems shut down, so\u2026
p9196
sg4
I21
sa(dp9197
g2
VWhat? What's happening?
p9198
sg4
I3
sa(dp9199
g2
VIt's gonna collapse the shield. It's trying to save power.
p9200
sg4
I10
sa(dp9201
g2
VThe city doesn't think we can maintain the shields unless we make it smaller. If we delay its collapse, it could fail completely.
p9202
sg4
I23
sa(dp9203
g2
VIt's not letting me.
p9204
sg4
I4
sa(dp9205
g2
VYou think I don't realize that?!
p9206
sg4
I6
sa(dp9207
g2
VAny word on how she's doing?
p9208
sg4
I6
sa(dp9209
g2
VRight. Listen, I think we should collapse the shield right to the tower.
p9210
sg4
I13
sa(dp9211
g2
VYes, it will. But our power is spread so thin right now, I don't have any extra juice to come up with the solutions to the hundred or so problems that could lead to our premature demise today.
p9212
sg4
I38
sa(dp9213
g2
VAlready done. We're ready.
p9214
sg4
I4
sa(dp9215
g2
V(to control room staff) Okay. Here we go.
p9216
sg4
I8
sa(dp9217
g2
V(to technician) Hmm\u2026Yeah. (to Sheppard and Teyla) All right, two bits of good news. One, I've been able to calculate our exact location.
p9218
sg4
I23
sa(dp9219
g2
VSadly, no. To activate the 'gate would require that we stay within a fairly small area of space. We're moving too fast to use it.
p9220
sg4
I25
sa(dp9221
g2
VWell, it would be great if they were working, but sub-light and navigation are out.
p9222
sg4
I15
sa(dp9223
g2
VYeah, well, at least we're not lost anymore, right? Number two, there is nothing wrong with our hyperdrives.
p9224
sg4
I18
sa(dp9225
g2
VThe damaged power conduits. We had plenty of gas in the tank, so to speak, we just couldn't get it to the engine. Stalled out.
p9226
sg4
I25
sa(dp9227
g2
VThat's they idea, yes. I mean, we wouldn't be able to repair them completely\u2026not without, you know, landing and shutting down, and such, but, uh, we can definitely patch them up. Look, Zelenka and his team are working as fast as they possibly can, but the problem is we're still leaking a lot of power.
p9228
sg4
I55
sa(dp9229
g2
VI'm afraid so, yes.
p9230
sg4
I4
sa(dp9231
g2
VLook, this is the minimum amount of power the city requires to execute a jump into hyperspace. If we don't fix the power conduits inside of an hour, we'll drop below that level. After that, we're stuck. We'll have maybe thirty hours before the shields fail, and we'll all die in the vacuum of space.
p9232
sg4
I55
sa(dp9233
g2
VHow's it going on this end?
p9234
sg4
I6
sa(dp9235
g2
VReally?
p9236
sg4
I1
sa(dp9237
g2
V(surprised) Well, that-that's fantastic!
p9238
sg4
I4
sa(dp9239
g2
VHappy? Huh, there's actually a chance we might make it through this thing. I am ecstatic! I am going to do a little\u2014
p9240
sg4
I23
sa(dp9241
g2
VThat lasted what, like a second?
p9242
sg4
I6
sa(dp9243
g2
V(incredulous) An asteroid belt?!
p9244
sg4
I4
sa(dp9245
g2
VWe don't have enough power!
p9246
sg4
I5
sa(dp9247
g2
VWell, don't take it personally. I'd like them up as much as you would, but we just can't afford the power.
p9248
sg4
I21
sa(dp9249
g2
VLook, Zelenka needs forty-five minutes to complete the repairs to the power conduits. If we raise the shields even for one minute, it'll eat up all his time. We can't do it.
p9250
sg4
I32
sa(dp9251
g2
V(thinking) Well, we're in the middle of a pretty big solar system right now, and the asteroid belt's probably made up of, uh, remnants of early, failed planets, so, you know\u2026building size and larger?
p9252
sg4
I34
sa(dp9253
g2
VIn principle, a good idea, but the chair room is outside the shield right now, and we'd never get to it. Look, we could um\u2026ah, that's not gonna work. We could\u2026
p9254
sg4
I31
sa(dp9255
g2
V(distracted) Twenty or so? Look\u2026no. (realizing Sheppard's plan) No, no, no, no, no. That is a bad idea.
p9256
sg4
I18
sa(dp9257
g2
VYes!
p9258
sg4
I1
sa(dp9259
g2
VI can. I just\u2014I need some time. If you, uh\u2026
p9260
sg4
I10
sa(dp9261
g2
V(snarky) Well, do it!
p9262
sg4
I4
sa(dp9263
g2
V(sheepishly) Yes, look, about that, actually. I\u2026
p9264
sg4
I7
sa(dp9265
g2
VOr die.
p9266
sg4
I2
sa(dp9267
g2
VLooks like the old video game Asteroids.
p9268
sg4
I7
sa(dp9269
g2
VI was terrible at Asteroids. I think I actually scored zero once.
p9270
sg4
I12
sa(dp9271
g2
V(panicking) There's too many of them, and they're coming too fast. We're not going to get them all!
p9272
sg4
I18
sa(dp9273
g2
VI can't control four drones at the same time.
p9274
sg4

sa(dp9275

VDammit!
p9276
sg4
I1
sa(dp9277
g2
VWell, now what?
p9278
sg4
I3
sa(dp9279
g2
VOh, that sounds important. Maybe someone else should, uh\u2026
p9280
sg4
I9
sa(dp9281
g2
VI see it.
p9282
sg4
I3
sa(dp9283
g2
VI can't believe that actually worked! That was amazing!
p9284
sg4
I9
sa(dp9285
g2
VYeah, so, Zelenka and his team should have the conduits repaired by now, so\u2026I think we're finally out of the woods!
p9286
sg4
I21
sa(dp9287
g2
VAw, come on!
p9288
sg4
I3
sa(dp9289
g2
VI told you I was no good at Asteroids.
p9290
sg4
I9
sa(dp9291
g2
VThe damaged conduits are on the outer edge of the city, which sadly is outside of the protection of the shield.
p9292
sg4
I21
sa(dp9293
g2
VHeh, it'll be a breeze\u2026with the exception of the micro-asteroids.
p9294
sg4
I10
sa(dp9295
g2
VHey, we just came through an asteroid belt. The big stuff's behind us, but there's still a bunch of, uh, little bullet-sized rocks out there?
p9296
sg4
I25
sa(dp9297
g2
VHuh, I'm sure you'll be fine.
p9298
sg4
I6
sa(dp9299
g2
VWell, because you've already worked out the details of the repair. You know, it would be a waste of time getting me up to speed.
p9300
sg4
I25
sa(dp9301
g2
VWell once you've suited up, uh\u2026fifteen minutes?
p9302
sg4
I7
sa(dp9303
g2
VHey, if the patch job we did on the conduits hadn't slowed down the power loss? We'd have hit the deadline already.
p9304
sg4
I22
sa(dp9305
g2
VYou can do this.
p9306
sg4
I4
sa(dp9307
g2
VWell, you know, trying to save the city and whatnot. Look, how's Elizabeth?
p9308
sg4
I13
sa(dp9309
g2
V(reeling) Oh my god. Uh, are you sure?
p9310
sg4

p9314
sg4
I7
sa(dp9315
g2
VWhat are they?
p9316
sg4
I3
sa(dp9317
g2
VNanites! Carson was able to render them inert using an electro-magnetic pulse.
p9318
sg4
I12
sa(dp9319
g2
VYou're a genius.
p9320
sg4

g2
V(over radio) Reactivate Weir's nanites.
p9322
sg4
I5
sa(dp9323
g2
VWhat?! I'd reprogram them.
p9324
sg4
I4
sa(dp9325
g2
VJohn, we are losing her here. Keller and her team have done everything they can. If I can reprogram the nanites to help repair her body without taking over her brain, then\u2014
p9326
sg4
I32
sa(dp9327
g2
V(sighing) I'm fairly confident I can reprogram them to do only what we want.
p9328
sg4
I14
sa(dp9329
g2
VAre you listening? Look, I said I can reprogram them to be completely harmless.
p9330
sg4
I14
sa(dp9331
g2
VSlowly.
p9332
sg4
I1
sa(dp9333
g2
VEh, short story, yes. Long story, no.
p9334
sg4
I7
sa(dp9335
g2
VI'm a hundred percent certain that I can reactivate the nanites and have them help put Elizabeth back together.
p9336
sg4
I19
sa(dp9337
g2
VProblem is, that they would do it by replacing her damaged cells with replicated nanites. Which means the moment I tell them to turn inert again\u2026
p9338
sg4
I26
sa(dp9339
g2
VYeah. Well, the good news is, I've been able to program them in such a way that they would never harm her, I-I'm sure of that. Plus I've shut down their ability to contact the Replicators via subspace, so both she and we would be safe. But, uh, she'd be part Replicator for the rest of her life.
p9340
sg4
I58
sa(dp9341
g2
VThere's a slight possibility I might be able to make them help repair her organic cells and then shut down when they're done, but, uh\u2026I need more time.
p9342
sg4
I28
sa(dp9343
g2
V(absently) Mmm. Thanks.
p9344

sa(dp9345
g2
V(sighing impatiently) What is it, Keller?
p9346
sg4
I6
sa(dp9347
g2
V(stunned) Wha\u2014I need more time.
p9348
sg4
I5
sa(dp9349

V(nervous) I heard we didn't get the array fixed in time.

I11
sa(dp9353
g2
VLook, she was dying, okay?
p9354
sg4
I5
sa(dp9355
g2
VLook, her heart was weak, her nervous system was fried.
p9356
sg4
I10
sa(dp9357
g2
VI reactivated the nanites.
p9358
sg4
I4
sa(dp9359
g2
VLook, you were busy! It was life or death! If I didn't act\u2014
p9360
sg4
I13
sa(dp9361
g2
VOkay, I know what you're thinking, but helping Elizabeth is not putting us at risk!
p9362
sg4
I15
sa(dp9363
g2
VThey're harmless! Look, I am a hundred percent certain they're not going to try to take her over or-or contact the others!
p9364
sg4
I22
sa(dp9365
g2
V(stubbornly) Yes. Yes, I can.
p9366
sg4
I5
sa(dp9367
g2
VBut\u2026that would kill her.
p9368
sg4
I4
sa(dp9369
g2
VYes, she would. She'd sure as hell do the same for you!
p9370
sg4
I12
sa(dp9371
g2
VWell, maybe not, but you know what, give it some time, you can ask her herself!
p9372
sg4
I16
sa(dp9373
g2
VNo. No, I'm not going to.
p9374
sg4
I6
sa(dp9375
g2
V(through gritted teeth) Oh, would you please just listen to me?
p9376
sg4
I11
sa(dp9377
g2
VThe quarantine is unnecessary.
p9378
sg4
I4
sa(dp9379
g2
VOkay, this is stupid.
p9380
sg4
I4
sa(dp9381
g2
VUs, fighting.
p9382
sg4
I2
sa(dp9383
g2
VLook, I know you're not happy with me, and you-and you may have some cause, but anyway, it's not going to matter much if we don't figure a way out of this, right? Look, we have to work together, so\u2026so, I-I'm sorry.
p9384
sg4
I42
sa(dp9385
g2
VAll right. (sighing) Well, someone should talk to her.
p9386
sg4
I9
sa(dp9387
g2
VAll right.
p9388
sg4
I2
sa(dp9389
g2
V(caustically) Not much.
p9390
sg4
I3
sa(dp9391
g2
VHe's conveniently leaving out the reason why those safety protocols are in place in the first place.
p9392
sg4
I17
sa(dp9393
g2
VExperimental jumper. Remember when I was zapped by that machine a few months ago, and I got, uh\u2026well, even smarter than I normally am?
p9394
sg4
I24
sa(dp9395
g2
VWell, before I was reset, I was very close to giving one of our puddle jumpers a hyperdrive.
p9396
sg4
I18
sa(dp9397
g2
VYeah! (gulping) Yes, I probably can.
p9398
sg4
I6
sa(dp9399
g2
VNo.
p9400
sg4
I1
sa(dp9401
g2
VYeah, two and change, maybe?
p9402
sg4
I5
sa(dp9403
g2
VAgain, no.
p9404
sg4
I2
sa(dp9405
g2
VWell, the drive's never been tested.
p9406
sg4
I6
sa(dp9407
g2
VYeah, ideally, somewhere with a few ZPMs to spare. We come back, we get Atlantis fully powered.
p9408
sg4
I17
sa(dp9409
g2
VYeah\u2026yeah, we know they have a few ZPMs.
p9410
sg4
I8
sa(dp9411
g2
VThat\u2026that would be the Replicator homeworld. You feel up to a heist?
p9412
sg4
I12
sa(dp9413
g2
VInitiating secondary diagnostics\u2026now.
p9414
sg4
I3
sa(dp9415
g2
VMmm, Are you sure?
p9416
sg4
I4
sa(dp9417
g2
VOkay, just get over here and monitor power readings.
p9418
sg4
I9
sa(dp9419
g2
VHuh. No variances.
p9420
sg4
I3
sa(dp9421
g2
VAre you catching any discrepancies on your end?
p9422
sg4
I8
sa(dp9423
g2
VAre you sure?
p9424
sg4
I3
sa(dp9425
g2
VOkay, just\u2026go back-go back-go back, go back, go back.
p9426
sg4
I9
sa(dp9427
g2
VYeah, the 'gate's not working.
p9428
sg4
I5
sa(dp9429
g2
V(annoyed) I did not break the 'gate.
p9430
sg4
I7
sa(dp9431
g2
VI wasn't screwing around with it! I was running a streamlining program designed to boost its operating efficiency.
p9432
sg4
I18
sa(dp9433
g2
VIt had nothing to do with why the gate malfunctioned. Look, we've been able to eliminate a number of possible reasons, including my streamlining program. And I feel confident that we're making some progress, and that things will be up and running in\u2026
p9434
sg4
I43
sa(dp9435
g2
VWhat is that?
p9436
sg4
I3
sa(dp9437
g2
VWell, why didn't the sensors pick it up?
p9438
sg4
I8
sa(dp9439
g2
VI'm getting a low-level energy signature.
p9440
sg4
I6
sa(dp9441
g2
VThank god it hit the reading library, or someone really could've gotten hurt.
p9442
sg4
I13
sa(dp9443
g2
VWell, it's obviously some kind of mobile self-contained unit\u2014a drone, possibly a probe. It's definitely not Wraith design.
p9444
sg4
I18
sa(dp9445
g2
VYeah, maybe. It's still emanating a trace energy field.
p9446
sg4
I9
sa(dp9447
g2
VNo, it's just interesting.
p9448
sg4
I4
sa(dp9449
g2
V(dismissively) Re-entry wouldn't have caused that.
p9450
sg4
I6
sa(dp9451
g2
VAnd yet it came out in one piece.
p9452
sg4
I8
sa(dp9453
g2
V(mouth full) By design.
p9454
sg4
I4
sa(dp9455
g2
V(mouth full) Ah, but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an advanced masking system\u2014to fool us. They're good; I'm better.
p9456
sg4
I22
sa(dp9457
g2
VJust, um, do me a favor. Relaunch your decrypt sweep.
p9458
sg4
I10
sa(dp9459
g2
VHumor me.
p9460
sg4
I2
sa(dp9461
g2
VHang on. It's working. I'm getting something.
p9462
sg4
I7
sa(dp9463
g2
VHey, n-n-no, no no. Don't touch anything.
p9464
sg4
I7
sa(dp9465
g2
VWhoa-whoa-whoa. What happened? What did you do?
p9466
sg4
I7
sa(dp9467
g2
VI told you not to touch anything!
p9468
sg4
I7
sa(dp9469
g2
VWe lost all the data!
p9470
sg4
I5
sa(dp9471
g2
V(looking worried) Nanite code. It's the Replicators.
p9472
sg4
I7
sa(dp9473
g2
VIt's the Replicators. They found us!
p9474
sg4
I6
sa(dp9475
g2
VThat drone we recovered contained nanites.
p9476
sg4
I6
sa(dp9477
g2
V(insistently) I know what I saw. It was nanite code a split second before the system crashed.
p9478
sg4
I17
sa(dp9479
g2
VThat's because you weren't looking.
p9480
sg4
I5
sa(dp9481
g2
VWell, obviously, you didn't! Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this dis\u2014
p9482
sg4
I11
sa(dp9483
g2
VAnother one!
p9484
sg4
I2
sa(dp9485
g2
VWha\u2026what happened?
p9486
sg4
I2
sa(dp9487
g2
V(flatly) Lucky us.
p9488
sg4
I3
sa(dp9489
g2
VSomething's not right. That diagnostic program should never have crashed. It was perfectly capable of handling any of the data coming from the probe. And then before I get a chance to get it up and running again, what happens? The probe gets destroyed.
p9490
sg4
I44
sa(dp9491
g2
V(sighing) I don't know. I just\u2014it just feels like someone or something is working very hard to get in my way. And yes, I know what that sounds like. Just\u2026do me a favor, keep an eye open, okay?
p9492
sg4
I38
sa(dp9493
g2
VHey!
p9494
sg4
I1
sa(dp9495
g2
VWhat are you all doing here? What's going on?
p9496
sg4
I9
sa(dp9497
g2
VUh\u2026I'll be right back. I just remembered I forgot to unplug something\u2026or-or plug it in.
p9498
sg4
I15
sa(dp9499
g2
V(panicking) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Wh-wh-Wait, hey, what are you doing?
p9500
sg4
I8
sa(dp9501
g2
V(terrified) What are you\u2026No! Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!
p9502
sg4
I5
sa(dp9503
g2
VWhat is the matter with you?
p9504
sg4
I6
sa(dp9505
g2
VWell, I'm going to need more than that. I'm gonna need disinfectant, or some stitches\u2014
p9506
sg4
I15
sa(dp9507
g2
V(shocked) It's gone. That's impossible. How can-how can it\u2026?
p9508
sg4
I9
sa(dp9509
g2
VTest? Wh-what test? What the hell is going on here?!
p9510
sg4
I10
sa(dp9511
g2
VYeah\u2026I wasn't sure what to make of it. At first, I was ready to dismiss Zelenka's screw-up as just, uh, gross incompetence. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I thought it didn't make sense, even for him. No no. That was no accident. I mean, he crashed that diagnostic system on purpose.
p9512
sg4
I56
sa(dp9513
g2
VBut what does any of this have to do with my super-healing abilities?
p9514
sg4
I13
sa(dp9515
g2
VOh, but the last time that happened, it was the, er, the retro-virus.
p9516
sg4
I13
sa(dp9517
g2
VAnd?
p9518
sg4
I1
sa(dp9519
g2
V(taken aback) What, you think she's lying?
p9520
sg4
I7
sa(dp9521
g2
VWell, I can access the infirmary's database from here. I just\u2026
p9522
sg4
I11
sa(dp9523
g2
VOkay, I'm in. Now\u2026and\u2026huh.
p9524
sg4
I4
sa(dp9525
g2
VWell, there's no record of any blood test. If she did one, then she didn't enter the results.
p9526
sg4
I18
sa(dp9527
g2
VThere's nothing here.
p9528
sg4
I3
sa(dp9529
g2
VWell, that doesn't mean they can't be erased.
p9530
sg4
I8
sa(dp9531
g2
VI have an idea.
p9532
sg4
I4
sa(dp9533
g2
V(over radio) I've patched into the life signs detector, but there's a problem.
p9534
sg4
I13
sa(dp9535
g2
V(into radio) Just\u2014I'm not sure. Just-just, hold on a minute.
p9536
sg4
I10
sa(dp9537
g2
V(caustically) Right. Thank you for your input.
p9538
sg4
I7
sa(dp9539
g2
VHold on.
p9540
sg4
I2
sa(dp9541
g2
VThis is bizarre. I mean, I can't get it to give me a live feed. It's like it's-it's stuck in a loop.
p9542
sg4
I22
sa(dp9543
g2
VHah! All right, I got it.
p9544
sg4
I6
sa(dp9545
g2
VWhat the hell\u2026?
p9546
sg4
I3
sa(dp9547
g2
V(protesting) I didn't break it. It's working fine.
p9548
sg4
I8
sa(dp9549
g2
VYeah, the infirmary, the corridors, the surrounding towers\u2026I mean, according to this, we're the only people on the base.
p9550
sg4
I19
sa(dp9551
g2
V(over radio) Well, offhand, I would say it's not, but right now, I am reading four life signs.
p9552
sg4
I18
sa(dp9553
g2
VI've got something. It's another life sign. It's the outer edge of the city.
p9554
sg4
I14
sa(dp9555
g2
VWell\u2026maybe we should\u2026
p9556
sg4
I3
sa(dp9557
g2
VThere's supposed to be a room here.
p9558
sg4
I7
sa(dp9559
g2
VThere is a room here.
p9560
sg4
I5
sa(dp9561
g2
VElizabeth!
p9562
sg4
I1
sa(dp9563
g2
V(stunned) How'd you get here?
p9564
sg4
I5
sa(dp9565
g2
VYou're Replicators.
p9566
sg4
I2
sa(dp9567
g2
VYou couldn't have replaced everyone on the base\u2014it's impossible!
p9568
sg4
I9
sa(dp9569
g2
VAh ha! See, now I know you're lying! Because, uh, a year ago, Carson Beckett was our chief of medicine, not Doctor Keller. In fact, she hadn't even arrived yet!
p9570
sg4
I30
sa(dp9571
g2
VNot infected with, constructed by.
p9572
sg4
I5
sa(dp9573
g2
VI know it's tough to swallow, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it myself, but, uh, it would explain a couple of things.
p9574
sg4
I27
sa(dp9575
g2
VSuch as why the 'gate's not working, for one? Look, if none of this is real, this is all just a-a lab rat experiment, then it stands to reason that the 'gate's not real either.
p9576
sg4
I35
sa(dp9577
g2
V(interrupting) The whole time the 'gate's been down, it has been solid overcast. That's over a week now. Think about it. When's the last time any of you saw stars?
p9578
sg4
I30
sa(dp9579
g2
V(caustically) Refocus on what?
p9580
sg4
I4
sa(dp9581
g2
VSo we can go where? Back to Atlantis to resume our lives? Oh yeah, I forgot. They're not ours.
p9582
sg4
I19
sa(dp9583
g2
VThere's no point in denying the facts. They were telling the truth. We're not who we thought we were.
p9584
sg4
I19
sa(dp9585
g2
V(sarcastic) Great. We're all in agreement. We're getting out of here. Now, all we have to do is figure out how.
p9586
sg4
I21
sa(dp9587
g2
VIf that thing hadn't crashed into the city, who knows how long this could've gone on.
p9588
sg4
I16
sa(dp9589
g2
VWell, you have to raise the shield.
p9590
sg4
I7
sa(dp9591
g2
VThat's it. The city's gone.
p9592
sg4
I5
sa(dp9593
g2
VYou were right. It's the Replicator home world. Looks like they've been busy.
p9594
sg4
I13
sa(dp9595
g2
VRemember those shipyards we destroyed? That's one of them.
p9596
sg4
I9
sa(dp9597
g2
VAnd then some.
p9598
sg4
I3
sa(dp9599
g2
VIt's a streamlining program designed to boost its operating efficiency. Look, the 'gate will be offline for what, one hour? Two hours tops.
p9600
sg4
I23
sa(dp9601
g2
V(excited) Elizabeth! What happened to you? How'd you get away?
p9602
sg4
I10
sa(dp9603
g2
V(stunned) You look and sound just like her.
p9604
sg4
I8
sa(dp9605
g2
VUh, yeah, it's uh\u2026new. We got, uh, new versions of those uniforms. The, uh, old ones used to, uh\u2026
p9606
sg4
I19
sa(dp9607
g2
VYeah.
p9608
sg4
I1
sa(dp9609
g2
VAND CLONE MCKAY Hmm?
p9610
sg4
I4
sa(dp9611
g2
VAre you kidding? This is huge! We've got to get working on a\u2014
p9612
sg4
I13
sa(dp9613
g2
VAND CLONE MCKAY Modification program!
p9614
sg4
I5
sa(dp9615
g2
VRun through one of the Ancient relays so the information is\u2026
p9616
sg4
I11
sa(dp9617
g2
VAND CLONE MCKAY Automatically adapted and outputted!
p9618
sg4
I7
sa(dp9619
g2
VOf course it is!
p9620
sg4
I4
sa(dp9621
g2
VIt's not a problem. I'll just go back to Atlantis, and, uh, get what we need. We can, uh, do all the work right here.
p9622
sg4
I25
sa(dp9623
g2
VAnd this is just the beginning.
p9624
sg4
I6
sa(dp9625
g2
V(pleased) Can you imagine?
p9626
sg4
I4
sa(dp9627
g2
VWhat was that?
p9628
sg4
I3
sa(dp9629
g2
V(over radio) Yeah, I heard you. We're on our way.
p9630
sg4
I10
sa(dp9631
g2
VIt's the Replicators. Let's go.
p9632
sg4
I5
sa(dp9633
g2
VYou go ahead.
p9634
sg4
I3
sa(dp9635
g2
V(focused on his work) Eh, I will\u2026when I'm finished.
p9636
sg4
I9
sa(dp9637
g2
V(distracted) And what's that?
p9638
sg4
I4
sa(dp9639
g2
VThat's one of the perks of the job. If something terrible happens, you don't have time to dwell on it, 'cause you're too busy trying to stop the next\u2026terrible thing from happening. Seriously, if it wasn't for the Replicators, and their\u2026plan to wipe out every human in the galaxy, I'd be in pretty bad shape right now. No, this is Carson all over again, and I'm just not ready to deal. Not yet.
p9640
sg4
I73
sa(dp9641
g2
VEventually, but not now.
p9642
sg4
I4
sa(dp9643

sa(dp9647

p9648
sg4
I2
sa(dp9649
g2
VIt's all right.
p9650
sg4
I3
sa(dp9651
g2
VNo, I uh, I want to finish this. What about you? Isn't it past your bedtime?
p9652
sg4
I16
sa(dp9653
g2
VYeah. Me, too.
p9654
sg4
I3
sa(dp9655
g2
VWill do. Oh\u2026wait!
p9656
sg4
I3
sa(dp9657
g2
VHuh. If this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class Replicator ship in the galaxy in real time.
p9658
sg4
I20
sa(dp9659
g2
VWell, that's not so bad. I guess the Wraith have really taken a toll.
p9660
sg4
I14
sa(dp9661
g2
V(nervously) On the other hand, my duplicate did say they were building more.
p9662
sg4
I13
sa(dp9663
g2
VA lot more.
p9664
sg4
I3
sa(dp9665
g2
VOh, crap.
p9666
sg4
I2
sa(dp9667
g2
VBoth ships at the same time. This is a first.
p9668
sg4
I10
sa(dp9669
g2
VSeriously?
p9670
sg4
I1
sa(dp9671
g2
VIt is this recent discovery of the essential duality of this particular stem of the nano-sub-code that has opened up a whole new world of possibilities when it comes to the expedient and permanent deactivation of the inter-nanite bonds\u2026
p9672
sg4
I39
sa(dp9673
g2
VYeah, I-I'll let you know when I'm ready to take questions. Thank you.
p9674
sg4

VIf-if you just let me continue, I-I think you'll have a better understanding of the complexity that I'm\u2014
p9676
sg4
I18
sa(dp9677
g2
VWell\u2026no.
p9678
sg4
I1
sa(dp9679
g2
VWhat, just like that?
p9680
sg4
I4
sa(dp9681
g2
VBut Plan B, it's not a good plan.
p9682
sg4
I8
sa(dp9683
g2
VSure, the Apollo and the Daedalus have been retrofitted with the new Asgard plasma beam weapons, which given are very, very powerful, but they still can't destroy the Replicators.

I29

g2
VWell, "essentially neutralized" and "neutralized" are two very different things.
p9686
sg4
I10
sa(dp9687
g2
VThat's what I'm saying! Look, your way leaves Replicator cells inactive, just waiting around for someone to reactivate them. My way shuts them down for good.
p9688
sg4
I26
sa(dp9689
g2
VWell, you didn't let me finish my presentation.
p9690
sg4
I8
sa(dp9691
g2
V(affronted) Really?
p9692
sg4
I2
sa(dp9693
g2
V(angry) No, no, I'm just wondering when the Colonel here became a math and physics expert!
p9694
sg4
I16
sa(dp9695
g2
VOh, so now you're questioning my manhood?!
p9696
sg4
I7
sa(dp9697
g2
VNo! He just told\u2014
p9698
sg4
I4
sa(dp9699
g2
VLook, I think we've got this tracking system down. We can peg where they're going to be within a thirty minute window. And given current data, we've got at least twelve hours before any of their ships are even close to an inhabited planet. Just give me and the Wraith like\u2026ten hours to get this shut-down program working. If I don't, then you can just feel free to go ahead and open up on them with your "beam weapons."
p9700
sg4
I79
sa(dp9701
g2
VAll right.
p9702
sg4
I2
sa(dp9703
g2
V(protesting) I didn't lie to them.
p9704
sg4
I6
sa(dp9705
g2
VThat is quitter talk! Look, you don't know me. This is when I'm at my best, this is when I shine! Impossible deadlines! Did I ever tell you about the time that I once got a damaged Ancient hyperdrive system online moments before me and my crew were incinerated by a super-volcano?
p9706
sg4
I52
sa(dp9707
g2
VWell, there you go. See, I work best under pressure.
p9708
sg4
I10
sa(dp9709
g2
VEasy, easy. He's just kidding. (to Wraith) Just, tell 'em you were joking.
p9710
sg4
I13
sa(dp9711
g2
VRight.
p9712
sg4
I1
sa(dp9713
g2
V(meekly) I'll work in this area.
p9714
sg4
I6
sa(dp9715
g2
VWhat? So soon?
p9716
sg4
I3
sa(dp9717
g2
VWell, no, I'm not.
p9718
sg4
I4
sa(dp9719
g2
VNo, no I'll stay here. This still needs to get done. Good luck.
p9720
sg4
I13
sa(dp9721
g2
VEvidently, they haven't figured out how we're tracking them, and\u2014
p9722
sg4
I10
sa(dp9723
g2
VEither way, they want to stop losing ships.
p9724
sg4
I8
sa(dp9725
g2
VYeah.
p9726
sg4
I1
sa(dp9727
g2
VVaguely.
p9728
sg4
I1
sa(dp9729
g2
VWell, I'm just, um, dotting some "i's", crossing some "t's"\u2026
p9730
sg4
I10
sa(dp9731
g2
VHmm.
p9732
sg4
I1
sa(dp9733
g2
VHey, I should\u2026just get back to my lab.
p9734
sg4
I8
sa(dp9735
g2
V(despondent) Oh. I have to tell them. I have to tell them we don't have anything.
p9736
sg4
I16
sa(dp9737
g2
VEllis is going to love this. I-I don't get it. We tried reconfiguring their stand-down code. We tried programming the nanites to turn themselves off. Something should have worked.
p9738
sg4
I29
sa(dp9739
g2
VYeah, well I thought I was ingeniouser.
p9740
sg4
I7
sa(dp9741
g2
VYes, I know that's not a word, Mister\u2026Helpful. All right, look, maybe we could figure out some way to use the anti-replicator guns somehow.
p9742
sg4
I24
sa(dp9743
g2
VEven if they haven't, we'd still have to get them all in one place.
p9744
sg4
I14
sa(dp9745
g2
V(distracted) I think I've got my first good idea in three weeks.
p9746
sg4
I12
sa(dp9747
g2
VOur old anti-replicator technology relied on disrupting the bonds between each individual nanite cell. They just, uh, collapsed in a pile of dust, right?
p9748
sg4
I24
sa(dp9749
g2
VRight. Well, the thinking was always to continue down that line, to uh, break the bonds, to turn them off, uh, sever their connections to one another. Because dust we can deal with, right?
p9750
sg4
I34
sa(dp9751
g2
VWe do the opposite! Instead of severing their connections, we significantly dial up their attraction to one another. We turn each cell into an incredibly powerful nanite magnet. You know, one cell attracts another cell; those two attract two more. And as more and more nanite cells, uh, bond to the core group, they become stronger and stronger and stronger. To the point where every Replicator cell on the planet, in orbit, all of them, are massed in this-in this-in this giant, super-dense blob.
p9752
sg4
I84
sa(dp9753
g2
VIt is. Yes, actually.
p9754
sg4
I4
sa(dp9755
g2
V(dismissively) No. At least not at first. Look, this is not their normal form of bonding. I mean, it'll take them some time to adapt, to-to figure out how to function within the new parameters.
p9756
sg4
I35
sa(dp9757
g2
VWell, I mean, I'd hate to speculate.
p9758
sg4
I7
sa(dp9759
g2
VLook, it doesn't matter anyways, because long before that happens, they're going to fuse together so tightly, they will be rendered essentially inert. Remember, this bond is occurring on a subspace level\u2014
p9760
sg4
I32
sa(dp9761
g2
VTo the point where their electrons are fusing with their protons, and once that starts happening, they're toast.
p9762
sg4
I18
sa(dp9763
g2
VYeah, but you're talking about neutron star levels of density.
p9764
sg4
I10
sa(dp9765
g2
V(excited) Precisely!
p9766
sg4
I2
sa(dp9767
g2
VI have a better idea.
p9768
sg4
I5
sa(dp9769
g2
VTah-dah!
p9770
sg4
I1
sa(dp9771
g2
VThis? This has been in storage since we found it a while ago. The Ancients used it as part of their research into the creation of human-form Replicators.
p9772
sg4
I28
sa(dp9773
g2
VWe have the technology. The understanding of nanite coding. I mean, we have the Ancients' blueprints, for crying out loud.
p9774
sg4
I20
sa(dp9775
g2
VWell, not a whole one. Just-just a block of nanite cells say, you know, yay big. (he mimes a small cube) Look, just-just enough to get the ball rolling.
p9776
sg4
I29
sa(dp9777
g2
VI'm not talking about creating anything with normal Replicator abilities. Just a-a group of nanite cells that can serve as a platform for us to upload the new bonding program. We take it to the Replicator homeworld. We switch it on. We beam it into a populated area. We sit back and watch. It couldn't be easier\u2026
p9778
sg4
I57
sa(dp9779
g2
VThere is the one problem.
p9780
sg4
I5
sa(dp9781
g2
VThe Replicators on the planet will be affected fairly quickly, but there will be a definite delay until there's enough mass to attract the nanite cells in orbit.
p9782
sg4
I28
sa(dp9783
g2
VUnless we disable or destroy them.
p9784
sg4
I6
sa(dp9785
g2
VWell, if we don't disable them, they're just going to fly away, lay low, and replicate a new army.
p9786
sg4
I19
sa(dp9787
g2
VAll right, the basic nanite material has been formed. Let's see if we can get them to interact.
p9788
sg4
I18
sa(dp9789
g2
V(smug) Would you expect anything less?
p9790
sg4
I6
sa(dp9791
g2
VWell what?
p9792
sg4
I2
sa(dp9793
g2
V(petulant) I have not.
p9794
sg4
I4
sa(dp9795
g2
VThat is not true.
p9796
sg4
I4
sa(dp9797
g2
VIt is not!
p9798
sg4
I3
sa(dp9799
g2
VOf course. I've disabled most of the normal protocols. They won't be able to do anything beyond form a simple block. All right, here we go.
p9800
sg4
I26
sa(dp9801
g2
VNaturally.
p9802
sg4
I1
sa(dp9803
g2
VWill you stop that? I was never gone!
p9804
sg4
I8
sa(dp9805
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. We've got a problem. The cells aren't communicating properly.
p9806
sg4
I15
sa(dp9807
g2
VThis could be tougher than I thought.
p9808
sg4
I7
sa(dp9809
g2
VAnd I don't want to hear you say anything.
p9810
sg4
I9
sa(dp9811
g2
VAll right. Looking good.
p9812
sg4
I4
sa(dp9813
g2
VI know. I just wanted to give the cells time to establish their own internal cohesion. Now, we drop the field, and they should hold together.
p9814
sg4
I26
sa(dp9815
g2
VNot bad, not bad. Structure's intact. Bonds are holding.
p9816
sg4
I9
sa(dp9817
g2
VDammit.
p9818
sg4
I1
sa(dp9819
g2
VIn that case, there's only one thing we can do.
p9820
sg4
I10
sa(dp9821
g2
VJust go. Go. You're probably holding me back anyway.
p9822
sg4
I9
sa(dp9823
g2
VYou and I have two very different definitions of "this won't take too long."
p9824
sg4
I14
sa(dp9825
g2
VActually, unencumbered by the continual need to explain things to you, I've actually made remarkable progress.
p9826
sg4
I16
sa(dp9827
g2
VHmm. The systems the Ancients had in place were designed to create fully-functional humanoid Replicators, right?
p9828
sg4
I16
sa(dp9829
g2
VWell, turns out that trying to create something much simpler is, ironically, much more difficult. In the end, I was forced to compromise.
p9830
sg4
I23
sa(dp9831
g2
VI know that it wasn't part of the plan, but it was either this, or nothing.
p9832
sg4
I16
sa(dp9833
g2
VYeah, well, I'm sorry. But the block idea didn't fly. This was the only way.
p9834
sg4
I15
sa(dp9835
g2
VIt's not as bad as you think! I stripped down its programming as much as I possibly could without sacrificing basic viability. It can walk, it can talk, but it can't replicate or change its form or anything.
p9836
sg4
I38
sa(dp9837
g2
VOf course.
p9838
sg4
I2
sa(dp9839
g2
VYeah, so?
p9840
sg4
I2
sa(dp9841
g2
VDeath? It can't die. It's not alive. It-it's a program. I mean, it's "consciousness" is just a bunch of ones and zeros. I mean, you can call it "she" all you want, but it's still just a thing. It's-it's a prop. It's a\u2026it's a really advanced radio controlled weapon. I mean, you don't feel sorry for your bullets, do you? Your bombs?
p9842
sg4
I62
sa(dp9843
g2
VYeah, well, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter anyways, because we don't have any other choice.
p9844
sg4
I19
sa(dp9845
g2
VAll right. What is it?
p9846
sg4
I5
sa(dp9847
g2
V(nonplussed) No, no, it's fine.
p9848
sg4
I5
sa(dp9849
g2
VAre you sure?
p9850
sg4
I3
sa(dp9851
g2
VWe overload their ZPMs, about half a dozen of them in a symmetrical pattern around the Replicator mass. The force of the explosion causes the mass to compress even further, essentially creating our own Replicator fusion bomb. The whole planet will be destroyed in the process.
p9852
sg4
I46
sa(dp9853
g2
VNow, this causes a slightly new wrinkle in the plan. I'll need to beam down to the core room.
p9854
sg4
I19
sa(dp9855
g2
VFrom there, I should be able to hack into their systems and set the ZPMs to overload.
p9856
sg4
I17
sa(dp9857
g2
VNow, while I'm working in the core room, we'll beam Fran down to the city.
p9858
sg4
I15
sa(dp9859
g2
VFriendly Replicator Android?
p9860
sg4
I3
sa(dp9861
g2
VIt noticed that, uh, Zelenka and I both had names, and, um\u2026and she asked for one.
p9862
sg4
I16
sa(dp9863
g2
V(warily) It's a bit\u2026nerve-wracking. Yeah.
p9864
sg4
I5
sa(dp9865
g2
VYou do?
p9866
sg4
I2
sa(dp9867
g2
VRight. And you're\u2026fine with all this?
p9868
sg4
I6
sa(dp9869
g2
VWell, I know, it's just that you're\u2026you're gonna\u2026cease to be.
p9870
sg4
I10
sa(dp9871
g2
VWell, I-I just imagine you'd\u2026rather keep being than\u2026uh, than not.
p9872
sg4
I10
sa(dp9873
g2
VNo. No, that would be silly.
p9874
sg4
I6
sa(dp9875
g2
V(low, to Zelenka) I should never have given it speech.
p9876
sg4
I10
sa(dp9877
g2
VOn my way.
p9878
sg4
I3
sa(dp9879
g2
V(impatiently) Yeah?
p9880
sg4
I2
sa(dp9881
g2
VYou too, Fran\u2026Good luck.
p9882
sg4
I4
sa(dp9883
g2
VOkay. This won't take more than a minute.
p9884
sg4
I8
sa(dp9885
g2
V(into radio) I'm done. I've got total control over the power grid and the ZPMs, and Fran is\u2026Fran's just about to activate.
p9886
sg4
I22
sa(dp9887
g2
VIt's working, just hold those ships off a little longer.
p9888
sg4
I10
sa(dp9889
g2
V(surprised) It's working faster than I imagined.
p9890
sg4
I7
sa(dp9891
g2
VSoon. Really soon.
p9892
sg4
I3
sa(dp9893
g2
VThe Replicator mass. It's so heavy, it's sinking into the planet's surface.
p9894
sg4
I12
sa(dp9895
g2
VCopy that, Sam. I'll set the countdown, and we should be\u2014
p9896
sg4
I11
sa(dp9897
g2
V(worried) No\u2026It's the mass. It's collapsed the subterranean power grid. It's a black out. We're not going to be able to overload the ZPMs.
p9898
sg4
I24
sa(dp9899
g2
V(panicking) Not good. Not good. Not good!
p9900
sg4
I7
sa(dp9901
g2
V(into radio) The power grid's been destroyed. There's nothing either of us can do!
p9902
sg4
I14
sa(dp9903
g2
V(over radio) It's not as simple as that!
p9904
sg4
I8
sa(dp9905
g2
V(into radio) Look, in order to implode a mass this large, then the explosion has to be timed down to the nanosecond. The force needs to be exactly right\u2026I mean, you can't just fire a few nukes down here and get the job done.
p9906
sg4
I44
sa(dp9907
g2
VIt's the base raw material of Replicator cells. It makes all the sense in the world why the Ancients would set up on a planet where it's abundant.
p9908
sg4
I28
sa(dp9909
g2
VSam, we are geniuses!
p9910
sg4
I4
sa(dp9911
g2
V(continuing) Okay, the mass is so superheavy, that it's sinking into the planet's surface. If I dial it up just a little bit, it'll attract the neutronium and sink all the way to the core.
p9912
sg4
I35
sa(dp9913
g2
V(typing furiously into his hand-held computer) Just give me one more\u2026got it!
p9914
sg4
I12
sa(dp9915
g2
VUm\u2026we need to get out of here.
p9916
sg4
I7
sa(dp9917
g2
VAs much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.
p9918
sg4
I15
sa(dp9919
g2
VWelcome back.
p9920
sg4
I2
sa(dp9921
g2
VWell, they never showed up at the rendezvous point.
p9922
sg4
I9
sa(dp9923
g2
VI doubt it. Or, I guess they just figured that there was nothing left to talk about. So as soon as the planet blew up, we were back to being enemies.
p9924
sg4
I31
sa(dp9925
g2
VHey!
p9926
sg4
I1
sa(dp9927
g2
VYou'll be surprised to hear that, uh, removing a planet from the database is actually a lot of work.
p9928
sg4
I19
sa(dp9929
g2
VYou just can't resist bringing up the fact that I once accidentally destroyed a couple of planets, can you?
p9930
sg4
I19
sa(dp9931
g2
V(annoyed) You want to do the honors?
p9932
sg4
I7
sa(dp9933
g2
VAll right. M7R-227, you were a constant pain in the ass, it's good to see you go.
p9934
sg4
I17
sa(dp9935
g2
VMmm. Area 51 is working on it. You want to get a\u2026late dinner?
p9936
sg4
I13
sa(dp9937
g2
VAll right. I would've loved to seen Ellis's face when my plan worked. He's such a tool.
p9938
sg4
I17
sa(dp9939
g2
VYou do?
p9940
sg4
I2
sa(dp9941
g2
VOh, I see. Ha ha. Heh heh. I see where you're going with that.
p9942
sg4
I14
sa(dp9943
g2
VWell, it's only been a week since the battle, but, uh, a pretty clear pattern is emerging. You can see it on long-range scanners. The Wraith have split up into distinct groups.
p9944
sg4
I32
sa(dp9945
g2
VYes, well, with any luck, they'll find themselves in the middle of a nice, long, civil war. But, uh, what I find particularly interesting is this\u2026
p9946
sg4
I26
sa(dp9947
g2
VWell, that's our old friend, the Wraith that helped me save Jeannie and got us all those hive ships.
p9948
sg4
I19
sa(dp9949
g2
VWell, the subspace tracking device he used? It's the same signal.
p9950
sg4
I11
sa(dp9951
g2
VWell, I have no idea. I think it's safe to assume that he'd know we were monitoring that frequency.
p9952
sg4
I19
sa(dp9953
g2
VMaybe. Look, it's like I said. The hive ships that we've been tracking have formed into distinct groups, but this one's out there by himself. From what we can tell, it's just floating in the middle of empty space, nowhere near a habitable planet, and almost an hour's sub-light from the nearest 'gate.
p9954
sg4
I53
sa(dp9955
g2
VWell\u2026that's the question.
p9956
sg4
I3
sa(dp9957
g2
VAh, maybe.
p9958
sg4
I2
sa(dp9959
g2
VWell, it's about an hour by jumper. Oh! Look, I know we worked with this guy before, and he has helped us out in the past, but he's still a Wraith! We don't seriously feel like we owe him anything, do we?
p9960
sg4
I42
sa(dp9961
g2
VHmm.
p9962
sg4
I1
sa(dp9963
g2
VI'm not even\u2026
p9964
sg4
I3
sa(dp9965
g2
VI've got it, dead ahead. Looks like it's been shot up pretty bad.
p9966
sg4
I13
sa(dp9967
g2
VNo, I'm picking up residual radiation from Wraith weapons' fire.
p9968
sg4
I10
sa(dp9969
g2
V(impatiently) Well, it looks that way.
p9970
sg4
I6
sa(dp9971
g2
VI'm not picking up anything.
p9972
sg4
I5
sa(dp9973
g2
V(annoyed) Seems like an odd thing to do after being attacked.
p9974
sg4
I11
sa(dp9975
g2
V(more meek) Plus, they usually land the ship?
p9976
sg4
I8
sa(dp9977
g2
VStill picking up the Wraith tracking device. It's that way.
p9978
sg4
I10
sa(dp9979

VReading's stronger in here.
p9980
sg4

sa(dp9981
g2
VWe're not going to find him.
p9982
sg4
I6
sa(dp9983
g2
VWe are\u2026but someone cut it out of him.
p9984
sg4
I8
sa(dp9985
g2
VIncluding our friend.
p9986
sg4
I3
sa(dp9987

VTodd's a terrible name.
p9988

VWell, the hull's severely damaged. I'd say about thirty percent of the ship is sealed off and exposed to space. (brightly) But, uh, with a bit of work, I think we can get main systems back online.

VEh, it's coming along. I got the hyperdrive operational, though that's not going to help much if I can't get the neural interface to work.

I25
sa(dp10001
g2
VWhat'd you do?
p10002
sg4
I3
sa(dp10003
g2
VYou touched something, didn't you!?
p10004
sg4
I5
sa(dp10005
g2
VThank you, Captain Obvious. Of course it's a map. The question is, a map to what?
p10006
sg4
I16
sa(dp10007
g2
VAh, you're back! Well, I've managed to get the neural interface talking to the main systems, but I've got no way to test it, so it's-it's gonna need some tweaking. Biggest problem I've had so far has been with the weapons array, but I think I've managed to\u2014
p10008
sg4
I48
sa(dp10009
g2
VWell, I-I thought they'd come in handy when we go after the Wraith.
p10010
sg4
I13
sa(dp10011
g2
VOh, I figured out where this ship was headed before it was attacked.
p10012
sg4
I13
sa(dp10013
g2
VYeah, right. All you did was activate a screen! I'm the one who searched through the ship's log and found the mention of the top secret Wraith outpost.
p10014
sg4
I28
sa(dp10015
g2
VI'm sorry. I assumed a level of uncertainty was implied by my use of the phrase "top secret."
p10016
sg4
I18
sa(dp10017
g2
VThe log didn't specify. But whatever this thing is, they talk about this thing like it was sacred. From what I can gather, it played a pivotal role in helping the Wraith win their war against the Ancients.
p10018
sg4
I38
sa(dp10019
g2
V(awed) How did you do that?
p10020
sg4
I6
sa(dp10021
g2
V(studying displays) Oh, she's not kidding. According to this, navigation, propulsion, and communications are online.
p10022

sa(dp10023
g2
VShe's flying it all right.
p10024
sg4
I5
sa(dp10025
g2
VHey, don't look at me. I didn't do anything.
p10026
sg4
I9
sa(dp10027
g2
VHmm. I, uh, decided to go over the remainder of ship's log for any other mention of the outpost.
p10028
sg4
I19
sa(dp10029
g2
VThere's nothing, can you believe it? This thing goes back a long way. As far as I can tell, they haven't been to this place in thousands of years.
p10030
sg4
I29
sa(dp10031
g2
VWe should be in sensor range\u2026now.
p10032
sg4
I6
sa(dp10033
g2
VOh.
p10034
sg4
I1
sa(dp10035
g2
VWell, there's a space gate.
p10036
sg4
I5
sa(dp10037
g2
VWell, I didn't know! Look, the log wasn't exactly easy reading.
p10038
sg4
I11
sa(dp10039
g2
VYeah. I'm picking up an energy reading on the surface.
p10040
sg4
I10
sa(dp10041
g2
VNo. But there's something else\u2026a hive ship in orbit.
p10042
sg4
I9
sa(dp10043
g2
VWell, what say we keep it that way?
p10044
sg4
I8
sa(dp10045
g2
VThe energy readings are strongest over here.
p10046
sg4
I7
sa(dp10047
g2
VDon't worry, I've got an excellent sense of direction.
p10048
sg4
I9
sa(dp10049
g2
VI was ten! Plus\u2026I was running from a bee.
p10050
sg4
I9
sa(dp10051
g2
VIt's a queen.
p10052
sg4
I3
sa(dp10053
g2
VI have no idea.
p10054
sg4
I4
sa(dp10055
g2
VOh, that is just revolting.
p10056
sg4
I5
sa(dp10057
g2
VI'm definitely going to have nightmares about that.
p10058
sg4
I8
sa(dp10059
g2
VThat's what it looks like. The queen secretes genetic material which gets distributed through the structure into those pods. Presto\u2026newborn Wraith.
p10060
sg4
I21
sa(dp10061
g2
VYeah, I know, it sounds disgusting, but it actually makes sense. You got to remember, they're descended from insects, right? The thing I don't understand is\u2026why here? We always just assumed that this took place on their hive ships, but, uh, what's so special about this place?
p10062
sg4
I47
sa(dp10063
g2
VOh my god! Pods! Thousands of pods!
p10064
sg4
I7
sa(dp10065
g2
VI'm patched into the Wraith console. I've got internal schematics\u2026.whoa!
p10066
sg4
I10
sa(dp10067
g2
VIf I'm reading this right, what we saw from the surface is just the tip of the iceberg. I mean, this thing is miles in diameter.
p10068
sg4
I26
sa(dp10069
g2
VOver a hundred.
p10070
sg4
I3
sa(dp10071
g2
VWell, it doesn't make any sense. There's no way a single queen could provide enough genetic material to fertilize all those pods.
p10072
sg4
I22
sa(dp10073
g2
VQueens don't work together\u2026at least not as far as we know.
p10074
sg4
I11
sa(dp10075
g2
VYou've seen how big it is. I doubt our C-4's going to make much of a dent.
p10076
sg4
I17
sa(dp10077
g2
VTheoretically, that could work. Problem is, there's another hive ship out there. They'd be on top of us long before we'd finish the job.
p10078
sg4
I24
sa(dp10079
g2
VMaybe. I guess we can shut them down for a while.
p10080
sg4
I11
sa(dp10081
g2
VThe only problem is, these readings are coming from all around us. We're basically in the middle of a giant machine. I'm not sure I can pinpoint the source.
p10082
sg4
I29
sa(dp10083
g2
VThat's why it was key to their victory over the Ancients. We always knew they did it with greater numbers, we just never knew where they came from!
p10084
sg4
I28
sa(dp10085
g2
VZPMs. He's talking about ZPMs.
p10086
sg4
I5
sa(dp10087
g2
VThe one that disabled your ship.
p10088
sg4
I6
sa(dp10089
g2
VThis is good news, right? It means all we have to do to shut this place down is get our hands on those ZPMs.
p10090
sg4
I24
sa(dp10091
g2
VThere's one thing I don't understand: Back when you defeated the Ancients, how did you get your hands on the ZPM?
p10092
sg4
I21
sa(dp10093
g2
V(fascinated) At which point, you brought them back here.
p10094
sg4
I9
sa(dp10095
g2
VRight.
p10096
sg4
I1
sa(dp10097
g2
VOh, oh man! I got stunned.
p10098
sg4
I6
sa(dp10099

VYou did? How come I'm the last one to wake up\u2026? Hey, where's Todd?
p10100
sg4
I14
sa(dp10101
g2
VThat's good, isn't it? He'll come back for us. I mean, after all, we saved him.
p10102
sg4
I16
sa(dp10103
g2
VOh great. My entire life, I've never been chosen first.
p10104
sg4
I10
sa(dp10105
g2
VAnd now fate decides to restore the balance.
p10106
sg4
I8
sa(dp10107
g2
V"Weird?" Did you see how close I just came to becoming Wraith food? I don't think "weird" quite cuts it\u2014like, maybe "paralyzing," or "sickening," or-or-or "heart-stopping."
p10108
sg4
I26
sa(dp10109
g2
VOh great, she's back.
p10110
sg4
I4
sa(dp10111
g2
VUh, could you get her to tell us which way? 'Cause I kinda got turned around.
p10112
sg4
I16
sa(dp10113
g2
VThe only problem is we have no idea where they are, remember?
p10114
sg4
I12
sa(dp10115
g2
VIt didn't have any reference to ZPMs.
p10116
sg4
I7

VThere's a lot of data; I'm going to need a minute.

VI'm going to need more time!
p10124

VLook, there are hundreds of pages of information here, and it's all in Wraith!
p10126

g2
VYou do?
p10128
sg4
I2
sa(dp10129
g2

VAre you crazy?!
p10132

VHow?! In case you hadn't noticed, we're under attack!
p10134
sg4

V(shaken) Well, I think that should probably do the trick.
p10136

VCan you keep a secret?
p10150

p10152

VI feel it's time that, uh, Katie and I moved the relationship to the next level.

p10180

p10182
sg4

p10184
sg4
I8
sa(dp10185
g2
V(wiping his brow) Oh, am I? I suppose I am. Okay, um, I guess I-I should, uh, jump right into this. You know, rip the band-aid off, as they say\u2026not-not that this is painful in any way. It's quite the opposite, actually.
p10186
sg4
I42
sa(dp10187
g2
VIt's nothing. In-in fact, everything's right\u2026with us, I mean. So, I-I was thinking\u2026I don't know about you, but-but the way I see it, um, I thought that, uh, maybe\u2026it's time that we\u2026you know\u2026start entertaining the notion\u2026
p10188
sg4
I36
sa(dp10189
g2
V(worried) It's locked. We're trapped.
p10190
sg4
I5
sa(dp10191
g2
V(snapping his fingers) All right, I'm gonna need a radio. I left mine in the lab.
p10192
sg4
I16
sa(dp10193
g2
VWhat do you mean? What, you don't have a radio in here?
p10194
sg4
I12
sa(dp10195
g2
VWell, you need one now! Look, that alarm was a quarantine lockdown!
p10196
sg4
I12
sa(dp10197
g2
VAtlantis's, uh, self-protection against another outbreak. It's sealing off sections of the city to prevent the spread of a disease. I, uh, tweaked the, uh, system after the recent Kirsan fever outbreak.
p10198
sg4
I32
sa(dp10199
g2
VWell, hence the need to tweak the system, you know? Institute more vigorous protocols. Okay, I need to get to a computer, assess the degree of the situation. I mean, is this just a few sections that have been sealed off, or, uh, maybe the whole tower\u2026? Computer's in the other room, isn't it?
p10200

p10202

I3
sa(dp10203
g2
V(sighing) Oh they better be.
p10204
sg4
I5
sa(dp10205
g2
VI could "fiddle with it", sure. As to actually getting the door open? Not a chance. The quarantine protocol completely disables the door's control mechanisms. The whole point of it is to keep people from getting out.
p10206
sg4
I37
sa(dp10207
g2
V(panicking) We don't know that! We have no idea if it's going to be okay. For all we know,  Zelenka and Keller could already be infected! We don't even know how much of the city is in quarantine! If this is serious, and we have no reason to believe otherwise, we could be looking at a city-wide lockdown.
p10208
sg4
I58
sa(dp10209
g2
VHello? This is what I do! Someone needs to think ahead to the worst possible outcome to any situation in order to properly defend against it.
p10210
sg4
I26
sa(dp10211
g2
VHey, it doesn't take much for a-a good situation to-to turn ugly. One minute you're happily riding your bicycle back from acing your Lagrangian Mechanics midterm, you know, the warm breeze in your face, next thing you know, you're flying through the air 'cause you just hit a pothole.
p10212
sg4
I49
sa(dp10213
g2
VThe point is, one must always be on guard, you know? Always looking out for the potholes. Now, you can-you can call me a catastrophist, but it's a\u2026necessary burden I bear.
p10214

V(groaning) Ohhh.
p10218

p10220
sg4
I10
sa(dp10221
g2
VAre you sure? 'Cause, uh, oh\u2026my joints ache. It's usually the first sign of a fever.
p10222
sg4
I16
sa(dp10223
g2
V(brightening) That's normal.
p10224
sg4
I3
sa(dp10225

VI've always had a rapid heartbeat. Eh, ever since I was a kid. I mean, even when I was in a deep sleep, our-our-our family doctor once wrote a paper about it.
p10226

g2

p10228

g2
V(lamely) Right. Right. It's grown.
p10242
sg4
I5
sa(dp10243

VI already told you, it's impossible. Look, the whole point of the lockdown is to prevent the spread of disease, which means no one's going anywhere.
p10244

g2
VI'm sorry, Katie. Look, I've no doubt infected you by now.
p10246

VEvery disease is different. I mean, we have no idea what the incubation period for the strain is. It could be hours; it could be days. I mean, who knows when I caught it! No, it's just a matter of time before you succumb too.
p10248

p10252

I2

p10264
sg4
I8

p10266
sg4
I12
sa(dp10267
g2
VKatie, please. Enough already. As much as I'd love to believe that someone's going to swoop in and save the day, the fact that no one has tells me it's probably not going to happen. I'm sorry if that's bleak and-and-horrible and fatalistic, but there it is.
p10268
sg4
I47
sa(dp10269

p10276
sg4
I14
sa(dp10277
g2
VUh, no, it was a malfunction. A planetary anomaly\u2014ionospheric disturbance. I've actually, uh, recalibrated the system, so it'll take into effect future activity so, uh, we should be fine.
p10278
sg4
I29
sa(dp10279
g2
V(miffed) Technically, yes, but it was actually more of a group effort. But that-that's not why I came here. I, um\u2026 Here's the thing. Over the last year and a half, I have become aware that I have certain\u2026I don't want to use the word "flaws"\u2026uh\u2026uh, "shortcomings", perhaps? You know, for example\u2026on occasion, I-I can be negative\u2026and-and demanding, and-and a tad arrogant. But, uh, I'm also finding that just being aware of your, uh, shortcomings?\u2026is-is just the first, minute step on the road to betterment. And the real trick seems to be actually do something about it.

p10388

V(holding his hands up defensively) This is obviously some sort of huge misunderstanding, all right? I am-I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. I'm-I'm a close, personal friend of, uh, Ladon Radim. You know, your leader?
p10402
sg4
I33
sa(dp10403
g2
VI-I'm-I'm your greatest ally! I\u2014you don't know who I am? Look, I'm the genius scientist! The friend of John Sheppard? I gave you the bomb? No? Nothing? What do they teach you in Genii school?
p10404

p10418

sa(dp10419
g2
VNo, I wasn't.
p10420
sg4
I3
sa(dp10421
g2
VI was keeping them talking. You know? I was buying us time? A little thing called "strategy"? Obviously, you're too young to know anything about it.
p10422
sg4
I26
sa(dp10423
g2
VThose were Genii!
p10424
sg4
I3
sa(dp10425
g2
VSo what are the Genii doing here? And why do they want to kill her? I mean, aside from the obvious reasons.
p10426
sg4
I22
sa(dp10427
g2
VBut you know who they are. Are you trading partners?
p10428
sg4
I10
sa(dp10429
g2
V(glowering) But you were.
p10430
sg4
I4
sa(dp10431

VWhat about you, huh? When you're queen, are you going to start trade back up?
p10432
sg4
I15
sa(dp10433
g2
V(to Sheppard) You really believe that Ladon would give the marching orders to kill a little girl? Even this one?
p10434
sg4
I20
sa(dp10435
g2
VWell, it's creative.
p10436
sg4
I3
sa(dp10437
g2
V(with resigned sigh) Sure.
p10438
sg4
I4
sa(dp10439
g2
VI know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work, okay? I'm not scared of you. You're just a kid\u2014a bratty little kid. I couldn't care less that you're going to be queen. In fact, nothing could impress me less, so why don't you just cool it with the "bad seed" act and just go back to ignoring me.
p10440
sg4

p10452

V(low) Listen\u2026I've been doing a little thinking.
p10454
sg4
I7
sa(dp10455
g2
VI've got a Wraith stunner in my backpack. She can't weigh more than ninety pounds. I say we stun her and just carry her back.
p10456
sg4
I25
sa(dp10457
g2
VIt's kind of dangerous out there. I mean, the forest is crawling with Genii. Who knows when she could throw one of her fits.
p10458
sg4
I24
sa(dp10459
g2
VI'm sure you did, but she is thirteen, she's unreasonable, among many other awful attributes.
p10460

I15
sa(dp10461

p10462
sg4
I2
sa(dp10463

VOh, that sneaky little\u2026I told you we should've stunned her!
p10470
sg4
I10
sa(dp10471
g2
VI'm going to kill her.
p10472
sg4
I5
sa(dp10473
g2
VWe have been searching for her for over an hour. You know, we have had not one, but-but two close encounters with the Genii. All so some\u2026useless, spoiled brat can make her meditation appointment?
p10474
sg4
I34
sa(dp10475
g2
VSorry, I'm hungry. And when I'm hungry, I get cranky.
p10476

sa(dp10477
g2
VOkay, okay.
p10478
sg4
I2
sa(dp10479

p10496

I3
sa(dp10499

VHow?
p10500
sg4
I1
sa(dp10501
g2
V(incredulous) You made all this with that?
p10502
sg4
I7
sa(dp10503
g2
VWhat, and they covered all this in three sessions?
p10504
sg4

p10506

sa(dp10507

V\u2026or not.
p10508
sg4

p10524
sg4
I5

VYeah, well it wouldn't be the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last.
p10526
sg4
I16
sa(dp10527
g2
VIt means that a lot of people, particularly alien women, tend to fall for John Sheppard's good looks and charm.
p10528
sg4
I20

g2
VHe's a bit old for you, don't you think?
p10530

p10532

VI won't need to, trust me.
p10534
sg4

V(squirming) No, that's not true. I\u2026I don't not like you.
p10536
sg4
I10
sa(dp10537
g2
VIt means that you have a very annoying attitude, but I'm willing to cut you some slack because you're still just a child.
p10538

VThat's right. An adult would, uh\u2026

VHey! I don't have an attitude problem!
p10542

g2
VWell, that's sweet of you to say.
p10544
sg4
I7
sa(dp10545

p10554

V(to Sheppard) How far are they?
p10564
sg4

I3
sa(dp10567

VUm\u2026
p10568

I1
sa(dp10569

VI got it. It's okay.
p10570

I5
sa(dp10571
g2
VFascinating!
p10572
sg4
I1
sa(dp10573

VYeah, obviously. It's weird. This place seems strangely familiar.
p10574

sa(dp10575
g2
VWell, I'll be damned.
p10576
sg4
I4
sa(dp10577

VOh, yeah. It's Ancient.
p10578
sg4
I4
sa(dp10579
g2
V(inspired) It's the testing ground!
p10580
sg4
I5
sa(dp10581
g2
V(excited) I know what this place is! I've been reading about it. Hell, we've been looking for it for the last two years! I-I've seen the schematics.
p10582
sg4
I27
sa(dp10583
g2
VWell, believe it or not, this place actually does control the beast\u2014if the beast is what I think it is.
p10584
sg4
I20
sa(dp10585
g2
VMini-drones if I'm right; and you know, you can usually take that to the bank. I mean, this planet must have been where the Ancients first developed drone technology. It was their main testing ground!
p10586
sg4
I35
sa(dp10587
g2
VAnd that noise the beast was making? It was more like an electric swarm than a\u2014than a growl.
p10588
sg4
I18
sa(dp10589
g2
VProbably some sort of pass-key. I mean, the Ancient's weren't above protecting their research, even from each other. Look, you need more than just the gene in order to activate or control the drones, otherwise\u2026
p10590
sg4
I35
sa(dp10591
g2
V\u2026Yes, yes, yes, yes. Of course! It's in auto-protect mode. They're trolling the forest, taking out anybody without the gene. That's why they\u2026stayed clear of us and went straight for the Genii. Look, the\u2026royal pain here must have it as well.
p10592
sg4
I41
sa(dp10593
g2
V(indicating the downed Genii) Well, maybe because genius over there was messing with the crystal tray?
p10594
sg4
I16
sa(dp10595
g2
VWell, so, give me a second to figure out how much damage he's done.
p10596
sg4
I14
sa(dp10597
g2
VWell, who knows what kind of wacky rules they've imposed on it. I mean, I suppose it's possible that once a generation, the key needs to be reactivated here. Maybe it's the one thing that, uh, allows them to use the Ancient tech they have back at the castle.
p10598
sg4
I49
sa(dp10599

p10604
sg4
I7
sa(dp10605
g2
V(scared) Or we die.
p10606
sg4
I4
sa(dp10607

V(calling to Sheppard) You know, you're not exactly inspiring confidence.
p10608
sg4
I10
sa(dp10609
g2
VYou're hiding behind a foot of solid rock. How am I supposed to feel out here with only a cool breeze between me and the Genii?
p10610
sg4
I26
sa(dp10611
g2
V(irked) Do you have any idea how many crystal placement combinations there are?!
p10612
sg4
I13
sa(dp10613
g2
VTry seven thousand!
p10614

VGo! Go, go, go go!
p10618
sg4
I5
sa(dp10619
g2
VWell yeah, before they started shooting at it.
p10620
sg4
I8
sa(dp10621
g2
VWell, it was powered up. Fifty-fifty chance it's still operational.
p10622
sg4
I10
sa(dp10623
g2
VYeah, as long as they're wearing the\u2026pendant.
p10624
sg4
I7
sa(dp10625
g2
VOne hundred percent chance they'll kill us if we talk about it for much longer.

VLocked and loaded.
p10628
sg4

sa(dp10629

p10630
sg4
I2
sa(dp10631

VYou all right?
p10632
sg4
I3
sa(dp10633
g2
VSure, sure.
p10634
sg4
I2
sa(dp10635
g2
V(nonplussed) I did?
p10636
sg4
I3
sa(dp10637
g2
V(stammering) Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I just-I tripped and\u2026fell on top of you. It was an accident.
p10638
sg4
I19
sa(dp10639
g2
V(worried) No. No, no, no. I'm\u2026
p10640
sg4

sa(dp10641
g2
V(preening with false modesty) Well, I don't know about "hero"\u2026I mean, exceptionally courageous, perhaps.
p10642
sg4
I14
sa(dp10643
g2
V(under his breath) Kiss-ass.
p10644
sg4
I4
sa(dp10645
g2
VYeah, pretty much how I remember it.
p10646
sg4
I7
sa(dp10647
g2
VHey\u2026I, uh\u2026heard what happened. I'm very\u2026sorry.
p10648
sg4
I6
sa(dp10649
g2
VYou okay?
p10650
sg4
I2
sa(dp10651
g2
VYou know, I-I requested to go back with you, but the Ancient device on M7G-677 is malfunctioning.
p10652
sg4
I17
sa(dp10653
g2
V(unhappy) Yeah.
p10654
sg4
I2
sa(dp10655
g2
VOh, believe me, I would get out of it if I could, but, uh, without the EM field, they're an easy target for the Wraith. I guess it's just\u2026bad timing.
p10656
sg4
I30
sa(dp10657
g2
VYou want to talk, or\u2026
p10658
sg4
I5
sa(dp10659
g2
VRight\u2026
p10660
sg4
I1
sa(dp10661
g2
VThe one with the frequent tremors.
p10662
sg4
I6
sa(dp10663
g2
V(dismissive) It's a mining planet. It's not that surprising.
p10664
sg4
I9
sa(dp10665
g2
VThey're experiencing upwards of four tremors a day. My seismic team has concluded that the area where they've built their settlement is dangerously unstable. So\u2014
p10666
sg4
I25
sa(dp10667
g2
VMy analysis was enough, thank you.
p10668
sg4
I6
sa(dp10669
g2
VYes, and I'm pretty sure they've been breathing even longer. So again, my problem trumps yours.
p10670
sg4
I16
sa(dp10671
g2
VHaven't a clue. Whatever it was, they cleaned out the deposits and left.
p10672
sg4
I13
sa(dp10673
g2
V(talking over her) It would save us a lot of time in the back and forth.
p10674
sg4
I16
sa(dp10675
g2
VUh\u2026I was rather hoping you would go by yourself. And I would\u2014
p10676
sg4
I12
sa(dp10677
g2
V(also slightly winded) Oh, suck it up. It's not that bad. I have to hike this much almost every day.
p10678
sg4
I20
sa(dp10679
g2
V(nodding) Yeah, I'm a very active person.
p10680
sg4
I7
sa(dp10681
g2
V(piqued) That is private medical information that should not be so cavalierly shared in casual conversation, Doctor.
p10682
sg4
I17
sa(dp10683
g2
VThat's not the point! You know, I'm no Ronon. I'm not going to be on the cover of\u2026 Shape magazine anytime soon. But uh\u2026I can handle myself in combat. Stand my ground when I need to\u2014
p10684
sg4
I36
sa(dp10685
g2
VOw.
p10686
sg4
I1
sa(dp10687
g2
V(weakly) Not a problem.
p10688
sg4
I4
sa(dp10689
g2
VI would never move if that was the case. Ah.
p10690
sg4
I10
sa(dp10691
g2
V(groaning) At least externally.
p10692
sg4
I4
sa(dp10693
g2
V(pointing to the Genii insignia on the wall) I'd guess the Genii mining facility.
p10694
sg4
I14
sa(dp10695
g2
VI'm particularly not fond of the ceiling work.
p10696
sg4
I8
sa(dp10697
g2
VWhat about this one?
p10698
sg4
I4
sa(dp10699
g2
VOh. Can't argue with that logic.
p10700
sg4
I6
sa(dp10701
g2
VWell, did you see this? That's not going to budge unless we enter the right code. Look, these symbols are Genii numerals.
p10702
sg4
I22
sa(dp10703
g2
V(as Carter speaks) Yeah, it'd be a lot easier\u2026
p10704
sg4
I9
sa(dp10705
g2
VWhat she said.
p10706
sg4
I3
sa(dp10707
g2
VNo\u2026no. It's just\u2026highly, highly unlikely.
p10708
sg4
I5
sa(dp10709
g2
V(to Carter) After you, Monty.
p10710
sg4
I5
sa(dp10711
g2
VThere goes that plan.
p10712
sg4
I4
sa(dp10713
g2
V(patronizing) What, you think maybe there's a scary monster back there?
p10714
sg4
I11
sa(dp10715
g2
VI guess in Genii, red means "screwed."
p10716
sg4
I7
sa(dp10717
g2
VYeah, they should.
p10718
sg4
I3
sa(dp10719
g2
VTremor!
p10720
sg4
I1
sa(dp10721
g2
VThat sounded very, very bad.
p10722
sg4
I5
sa(dp10723
g2
VVery high.
p10724
sg4
I2
sa(dp10725
g2
VUh\u2026I'd say like five hundred.
p10726
sg4
I5
sa(dp10727
g2
VFour times a day at least.
p10728
sg4
I6
sa(dp10729
g2
VI don't think we're going to be able to just wait for Atlantis to figure out we're missing.
p10730
sg4
I18
sa(dp10731
g2
VYeah. Rickety old ones. I killed like, three of them on my way down.
p10732
sg4
I14
sa(dp10733
g2
VI don't think there's enough to\u2014
p10734
sg4
I6
sa(dp10735
g2
VYou think they'll support our weight?
p10736
sg4
I6
sa(dp10737
g2
VAll right, look\u2026if we're actually going to do this, I figure we need to stack these things, like, twenty feet high in order to climb out. So no matter how we build it, it's going to be unstable.
p10738
sg4
I38
sa(dp10739
g2
VSo, Sam goes.
p10740
sg4
I3
sa(dp10741
g2
VIt-it's heights! I'm probably worse than she is!
p10742
sg4
I8
sa(dp10743
g2
VAll right, fine.
p10744
sg4
I3
sa(dp10745
g2
VSam!
p10746
sg4
I1
sa(dp10747
g2
VIs she all right?
p10748
sg4
I4
sa(dp10749
g2
VLook, the bottom level won't hold. The crates aren't strong enough to stack.
p10750
sg4
I13
sa(dp10751
g2
VHello, hello.
p10752
sg4
I2
sa(dp10753
g2
VGrappling hook. Or at least, something we can use as a grappling hook.
p10754
sg4
I13
sa(dp10755
g2
VOkay, just a sec\u2014the ceiling is like, what, twenty feet?
p10756
sg4
I10
sa(dp10757
g2
VAll right, twenty-five. So, our jackets end to end are five or six feet\u2026tie those to our shirts, maybe even our pants together\u2026that should be able to get us up there and support our weight.
p10758
sg4
I35
sa(dp10759
g2
V(without enthusiasm) Oh good.
p10760
sg4
I4
sa(dp10761
g2
V(still flatly) Well, nice work.
p10762
sg4
I5
sa(dp10763
g2
VWell, I'm going to tie the rope on and toss it up there so you can climb up.
p10764
sg4
I18
sa(dp10765
g2
V(chiding) Hey, quitter talk.
p10766
sg4
I4
sa(dp10767
g2
VRight. That's a lot of knots.
p10768
sg4
I6
sa(dp10769
g2
VOkay, well, you gals get started on the, uh, knotting, and, um, I'll read those files.
p10770
sg4
I16
sa(dp10771
g2
VWhat? Look, they could contain the code to the door, there. Besides, three people can't knot the same rope. Unless either of you speak Genii.
p10772
sg4
I25
sa(dp10773
g2
VAre you talking about Neil Degrasse Tyson? He once stole an idea from me. Did I  tell you that story?
p10774
sg4
I20
sa(dp10775
g2
VUh\u2026"would you\u2014" Sorry, I don't get it.
p10776

g2
V(vaguely disturbed) Uh\u2026neither?
p10778
sg4
I3
sa(dp10779
g2
VIf I had to? So, I'm to choose which one of those guys I would want to force themselves on me because\u2014
p10780
sg4
I22
sa(dp10781
g2
VUh, yes, well I think I am. I just\u2026I think I should go back to my reading. You know, the one thing that could get us out of here?
p10782
sg4
I29
sa(dp10783
g2
VShut up a sec.
p10784
sg4
I4
sa(dp10785
g2
VNo, no, no. I hear something.
p10786
sg4
I6
sa(dp10787
g2
VThere's someone up there. (calling out) Help! We're stuck down here! Hello?
p10788
sg4
I12
sa(dp10789
g2
VWell, we came through that section. It's been eaten away by rust. The rest of the ceiling looks fine.
p10790
sg4
I19
sa(dp10791
g2
VHelp! We're stuck down here! Can you hear us!
p10792
sg4
I9
sa(dp10793
g2
VOh, thank god.
p10794
sg4
I3
sa(dp10795

VYeah, we know. We fell down here by accident.
p10796
sg4
I9
sa(dp10797
g2
VYeah, yeah, we're fine. We're just stuck. We need some help.
p10798

p10802
sg4
I3
sa(dp10803

V(angrily) All right, listen to me you little brats! I am older than you, and I am in charge!
p10804
sg4
I19
sa(dp10805
g2
VYou will go back to your parents! You will tell them we need help! Or so help me\u2014
p10806
sg4
I18
sa(dp10807
g2
V(to Carter) Oh, yes. Good. Great idea. Yes.
p10808
sg4
I8
sa(dp10809
g2
VMaybe you can show them your um\u2026
p10810
sg4
I7
sa(dp10811
g2
VI was once a ten year old boy too. I know what gets their attention.
p10812
sg4
I15
sa(dp10813
g2
VWhat? Do you want to get out of here or not?
p10814
sg4
I11
sa(dp10815
g2
V(sighing, dubious) If you say so.
p10816
sg4
I6
sa(dp10817
g2
VWould it have killed you to show 'em\u2014
p10818
sg4
I8
sa(dp10819
g2
VI'm warning you\u2014I mean, I could go crazy down here. Ever since the whole jumper thing a couple of years ago, I've been very bad in tight spaces.
p10820
sg4
I28
sa(dp10821
g2
VWait a second, what-what are you saying? You don't like Zelenka?
p10822
sg4
I11
sa(dp10823
g2
VYeah, but that's not what you said. You-you emphasized Zelenka. You said, "being stuck with Zelenka for three hours", like that was the hard part.
p10824
sg4
I25
sa(dp10825
g2
VYou can say you don't like him. It's fine! I don't like him.
p10826
sg4
I13
sa(dp10827
g2
VWell, yeah, sure, sure, sure. He's the best. You just don't like him.
p10828
sg4
I13
sa(dp10829
g2
VNo, you didn't have to. I know which one's your favorite now.
p10830
sg4
I12
sa(dp10831
g2
VEverything is a contest.
p10832
sg4
I4

p10834

g2
VSo.
p10836

VCarrell\u2026but I would pick Jon Stewart over both of them.
p10838

V(quickly) If I was forced to.
p10840
sg4

V(uncomfortable) Oh, uh\u2026well, it-it's kind of messed up now.
p10842
sg4

sa(dp10843
g2
VWell, I was going to\u2026propose. Uh\u2014
p10844
sg4
I6
sa(dp10845
g2
VYeah. I bought her a ring and everything. You know, was going to\u2026ask her, and then the, uh, quarantine error happened.
p10846
sg4
I21
sa(dp10847
g2
VWell, I don't particularly want to go into the details, but uh, you know, I just, I told her that I needed some time for me. Not, you know, it had nothing to do with her. I just-I just needed to figure some stuff out. And now she doesn't want to speak to me. She's filed for a transfer back to Earth\u2026
p10848
sg4
I62
sa(dp10849
g2
VNo, I didn't!
p10850
sg4

V(confused) No, I-I said I needed the time for me.
p10852

g2
VBut I meant it!
p10854
sg4
I4
sa(dp10855
g2
V(sadly) Oh. Oh, I suppose it was for the best. I mean, she deserves to be with someone who would've known that.
p10856

VWhat?
p10858

VLet me do it.
p10886
sg4
I4
sa(dp10887

VI can do it.
p10888
sg4

p10898
sg4
I3
sa(dp10899

g2
VStack a couple of crates, we're golden. We got that high before.

p10932
sg4

VWonderful.
p10948
sg4
I1
sa(dp10949
g2
VOkay. Well, the grappling hook because the hook wouldn't hold our weight in the soil. The crates didn't work because Sam was too heavy, uh\u2026
p10950
sg4
I25
sa(dp10951
g2
V(backpedaling) Oh\u2026we all would've been. I mean\u2026our weight in general. It had nothing to do with you. It just\u2026you\u2026I mean, you're in very good shape. Seriously, you have, like the perfect body.
p10952
sg4
I32
sa(dp10953
g2
VOh! Not that you don't! Oh, no, no, no. I realize that your bodies are different, and-and-and, uh maybe-maybe that that would mean that I think that your body is imperfect, but that is not the case. No, no, no. Far, far-far from it\u2014that\u2014that is, a sweet\u2026uh, which is to say\u2026I mean, it would be impossible for me to choose which of you\u2014

VRight. Okay, uh, right\u2026where was I? Uh\u2026All right, look\u2026if we can get this rod up there, attach the rope to it, it'll lay across the hole\u2014support our weight. We won't have to worry about the soil.

p10964

g2
VJust place the detonator inside the tube\u2026Now\u2026
p10966
sg4
I7
sa(dp10967

VWe have to seal the bottom of the tube around the gas leak, like so\u2026
p10968
sg4
I15
sa(dp10969
g2
VAll right, so, put the wadding and the rod in the barrel\u2026
p10970
sg4
I12
sa(dp10971
g2
VAnd then, "gently" create a seal. We don't want to pack it too tight, otherwise we've got ourselves a pipe bomb. But, if we play it right, our very own cannon.

p10992
sg4
I6
sa(dp10993
g2
V(panicked) No, no. I've never been very good at holding heavy things. I had an old lady's grocery cart when I was in college. It's one of the reasons I didn't date as much as I should have.
p10994

p11046
sg4
I2
sa(dp11047
g2
VI'd like to take a bath in whatever magical ointment they just put on my hands, 'cause they are the only thing that doesn't hurt. It's not going to scar, is it?

p11052
sg4
I3
sa(dp11053
g2
V(embarrassed) Ah, you're welcome. (takes deep breath) Right, well, I'm going back to my room, curling up in the fetal position, and sleeping for the next three days.
p11054

I28
sa(dp11055
g2
VHmm?
p11056
sg4
I1
sa(dp11057

p11058

VOh\u2026you-you want to have to have a drink?
p11064

g2
VUh, no. No, I'm not.
p11066
sg4
I5
sa(dp11067
g2
V(unconcerned) The intergalactic bridge is down.
p11068
sg4
I6
sa(dp11069
g2
VI don't know. We were sending the daily status report to the SGC, and we can't connect to Midway.
p11070
sg4
I19
sa(dp11071
g2
VEh, it's probably just a glitch, a simple software hiccup.
p11072
sg4
I10
sa(dp11073
g2
V(dismissively) Nah, the malfunction occurred several minutes after they went through. I'm sure they made it to Midway.
p11074
sg4
I18
sa(dp11075
g2
VNo, no, no. Look, the glitch occurred at M4F-788. That is a planetary gate at the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy, which means, worst-case scenario, they step through the puddle and they find themselves stranded on an uninhabited planet.
p11076
sg4
I39
sa(dp11077
g2
VYeah, it seems someone was dialing out from 788, which was preventing us from dialing in until now.
p11078
sg4
I18
sa(dp11079
g2
VOh, I doubt it. Look, even if the malfunction spat them out on the planet, the only logical address they would dial is back to Atlantis, which, as we know, they didn't.
p11080
sg4
I32
sa(dp11081
g2
VI'm telling you they made it to the Midway Station before the malfunction; I'm sure of it.
p11082
sg4
I17
sa(dp11083
g2
VIt is.
p11084
sg4

VThe MALP is through. Receiving telemetry. Visual coming in now.

g2
VSee? No Ronon, no Teal'c.
p11088
sg4
I5
sa(dp11089
g2
V(worried) That's Wraith tech. It's hooked up to the DHD!
p11090
sg4
I10
sa(dp11091
g2
VWe lost the feed.
p11092
sg4
I4
sa(dp11093
g2
VNo, no, no. That' s impossible. In mean, first, they'd have to know about the bridge, and even if they did, there's too many security barriers in place. Look, the encryption I used on the call-forwarding macro would've them taken years to try to fig\u2014
p11094
sg4
I45
sa(dp11095
g2
VHow?
p11096
sg4
I1
sa(dp11097
g2
VYou mean Todd? He was our ally! Look, and even if he wanted to, there's no way he could hack into my system\u2026could he?
p11098
sg4
I24
sa(dp11099
g2
VWell, connect to the bridge via another 'gate in Pegasus.
p11100
sg4
I10
sa(dp11101
g2
VM6R-125. We could connect the bridge through that, but I'd need to reconfigure the macros.
p11102
sg4
I15
sa(dp11103
g2
VAll right, we're redirected. We gate from Atlantis to M6R-125. We insert this crystal with the bridge macros into the DHD, dial the first gate in the void, and we're back on track all the way to Midway.
p11104
sg4
I38
sa(dp11105
g2
VWell, I'm-I'm uh\u2026 (sighing) All right, I-I'm gearing up.

I4
sa(dp11127
g2
VI don't know. This is extremely complicated.
p11128
sg4
I7

g2
VI have to figure out a safe work-around to avoid any commands that may have been compromised.
p11130
sg4

sa(dp11131
g2
V(irked) I'm working as fast as I can!
p11132
sg4
I8
sa(dp11133
g2
VBesides, even if I could shut down the 'gate, there's Wraith in every sector of the base. We're completely outnumbered. I mean, it's just a matter of time before they wipe us all\u2014
p11134
sg4
I33

p11140
sg4
I6
sa(dp11141
g2
VDid you not just hear me say I need to figure out a safe workaround to avoid any commands that may have been compromised? As in booby-trapped? Look, I didn't use the bypass to shut down the 'gate for this very reason!
p11142
sg4
I42
sa(dp11143

VWe've made a terrible mistake! We never should've revived Kavanaugh!
p11144

g2
V(tightly) That doesn't really matter now, does it?
p11146
sg4
I8
sa(dp11147
g2
VNo. We're completely locked out. The Wraith made sure if they couldn't have this station, then no one could.
p11148
sg4
I19
sa(dp11149
g2
VGreat, because we've got Wraith just about to blast through the door.

g2
VYeah, to be used as an emergency escape pod.
p11152
sg4
I9
sa(dp11153

VThey'll mount a rescue. It might take a couple of weeks, but the jumper is stocked with food and water. We should be all right, unless you want to stay here and get blown to smithereens with the rest of the station. Your call!

p11196
sg4
I31
sa(dp11197
g2
VWell, think of it as a-as a, kind of a "pre-baby present". Back on Earth, there's this company that produces recordings specifically for the fetus. The thinking is that, by, listening to the works of, say a great composer while still in the womb, the baby will be born with a natural predisposition toward musical ability, or in this case\u2026science.

g2
VHey, I've been cocooned inside an alien spacecraft, I've had another person living inside of me, I've encountered not one, but two different versions of myself. So who am I to judge, huh? If you say it was a vision, then I believe it was a vision.
p11214

p11226

p11254

VNah, Hoffan research wouldn't have meant anything to them.
p11266
sg4

sa(dp11267

VI don't know. One thing's for sure, whoever has it knew exactly what they were looking for.

V(pouting) I haven't even had lunch yet.
p11276
sg4
I7
sa(dp11277

VActually, in an indirect way you did. The Wraith who led the attack was able to access the Midway Station with information that you stole on your last visit to Atlantis.
p11278
sg4
I31
sa(dp11279
g2
VWell, according to Todd, every Wraith faction has been hit, which makes it extremely unlikely that any of them are responsible.
p11280
sg4
I21
sa(dp11281
g2
VWell, temporarily converted. Eventually, he became kind of a\u2026human-Wraith hybrid.
p11282
sg4
I10
sa(dp11283
g2
VHe's not a big fan of humans either. No, for him, the Hoffan drug is the perfect weapon.
p11284
sg4
I18
sa(dp11285
g2
VWell, not really, but even if we did, we'd have no way of finding him.
p11286
sg4
I15
sa(dp11287
g2
VWell, why not?
p11288
sg4
I3
sa(dp11289
g2
VTheoretically, yes. But practically, it really wouldn't be in their best interest to poison their own food supply, regardless of whether our research helped them come up with an antidote or not. No, I think the more likely scenario is that they find an antidote that works as a short-term solution to the existing threat. Then they work on weaponizing the protein. You know, coming up with a more effective delivery system, one that cuts out the middle-man, in this case the human victims? No, what we're doing? Is giving them the means to kill each other off.
p11290
sg4

VOne of our people, Teyla, was taken by a dart today.
p11294

p11296
sg4
I11
sa(dp11297
g2
VThis tablet has the address of an off-world relay station. If you leave a message for us, we'll get it. It also has our research on the Hoffan drug.
p11298
sg4
I29
sa(dp11299
g2
VAre you kidding? This is the first decent meal I've had all day. Besides, it's not going to help Teyla at all starving ourselves. I'm just trying to, uh, keep my strength up. I suggest you two do the same.

sa(dp11301

p11302

p11308

I13
sa(dp11309

p11326
sg4

p11332

VYeah\u2026See, the thing is\u2026we weren't.
p11334
sg4
I5

g2
VWe weren't looking for you. We didn't even know you were missing.
p11336
sg4
I12
sa(dp11337
g2
VWe went back to M8G-352. We\u2026rescued you from Michael. I mean, he got away, but we got you back to Atlantis, safe and sound.
p11338
sg4
I24
sa(dp11339
g2
VWell, obviously not you-you, but another you. Another\u2026Carson Beckett.

VI wish it was.
p11342

sa(dp11343
g2
VWell, no.
p11344
sg4
I2
sa(dp11345
g2
VHe came back from the planet. He resumed his duties. Everything went back to normal. Then, about six months later\u2026he was killed in an explosion. To us, you weren't missing, Carson. You-you were dead.
p11346
sg4
I34

g2
VI know this is a lot for you to take in\u2026
p11348

g2
VWell\u2026yeah.
p11350
sg4
I1
sa(dp11351
g2
VYou were dead! I mean, I'm sorry to be blunt, but we buried you. I mean, there was a memorial service at her church. I was there.
p11352
sg4
I27
sa(dp11353
g2
VNo, you can't! I mean you have any idea what kind of effect that could have?! I mean, besides, what are you going to say to her?
p11354

sa(dp11355
g2
V(placating) Carson\u2026
p11356

I2
sa(dp11357
g2
VI can't do that.
p11358
sg4
I4
sa(dp11359
g2
V(quietly) She's dead, Carson. She was killed by the Replicators. Sacrificed herself to save the rest of us. I'm sorry. I-I don't know what else to say.
p11360
sg4
I27
sa(dp11361
g2
VIt doesn't matter.
p11362
sg4
I3
sa(dp11363
g2
VAs far as I'm concerned, one of the best friends I ever had just came back from the dead. I'm not going to quibble over a couple of\u2026telomeres!
p11364
sg4
I28
sa(dp11365
g2
VNo, no you're not! Because the real Carson Beckett wouldn't be standing here feeling sorry for himself. He'd be trying to figure out how to try and help us!
p11366
sg4
I29
sa(dp11367
g2
V(blankly) Why wouldn't it be?
p11368
sg4
I5
sa(dp11369
g2
VBut there's no denying the fact that he's no ordinary clone. I mean, somehow, Michael has managed to reproduce his\u2026memories, his thought processes, I mean, his personality! I've spent some time with him, and I-I'm telling you, he's Carson!
p11370
sg4
I39
sa(dp11371
g2
VHe knows the layouts of at least, uh, four facilities that Michael has on different planets. Apparently he likes to move around a lot, stay one step ahead of the Wraith.
p11372
sg4
I31
sa(dp11373
g2
VWell, they blindfolded him every time they moved him, so he couldn't see the DHD. Although, he did catch a glimpse of an address dialed by one of Michael's, uh, mercenaries. That could be a place to start.
p11374
sg4
I38
sa(dp11375
g2
VWe haven't even told you what he looks like.
p11376
sg4
I9
sa(dp11377
g2
VIs he dead?
p11378
sg4
I3
sa(dp11379
g2
VHe was Michael's spy in the Athosian village! Look, he got the P-90 from the weapons cache we left there.
p11380
sg4
I20
sa(dp11381
g2
VWhy is this happening now?
p11382
sg4
I5
sa(dp11383
g2
VWell, you survived for almost two years with Michael. I mean, shouldn't you have felt some kind of effects from this condition before now?
p11384
sg4
I24
sa(dp11385
g2
V(caustically) Why is that?
p11386
sg4
I4
sa(dp11387
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. If he goes on this mission, it could kill him. We can't ask him to do this.
p11388
sg4
I24
sa(dp11389
g2
V(caustic) Give me a break.
p11390
sg4
I5
sa(dp11391
g2
VI'm sorry, I'm just a little concerned that we're willing to be so cavalier with his life because we think of him as some kind of a-a cheap copy!
p11392
sg4
I29
sa(dp11393
g2
VCarson!
p11394
sg4
I1
sa(dp11395
g2
V(worried) Look at you. You can barely stand. You don't have to do this!
p11396
sg4
I14
sa(dp11397
g2
V(frustrated) The real Carson also never listened to my advice. Look, you don't have to prove anything, certainly not to me.
p11398
sg4
I21
sa(dp11399
g2
VI'm reading a bunch of life signs up ahead.
p11400

p11408
sg4
I3
sa(dp11409
g2
V(shouting to his team members around the room) I don't mean to rush this, but I'm picking up an energy reading. Someone's firing up the ship!
p11410
sg4
I26
sa(dp11411
g2
VCarson! Carson!
p11412
sg4
I2
sa(dp11413

VThis way.
p11414
sg4
I2
sa(dp11415
g2
VIt's Carson.
p11416
sg4
I2
sa(dp11417
g2
V(annoyance masking worry) You ran off, that's what happened.
p11418
sg4
I9
sa(dp11419
g2
VIt's the ship.
p11420
sg4
I3
sa(dp11421
g2
VIt's not your fault. He made you receptive to the mind link. It's how he controls all of them\u2026the hybrids.
p11422
sg4
I20
sa(dp11423
g2
VYou made a difference. We've got Michael on the run! It's just a matter of time before we catch up with him.
p11424
sg4
I22
sa(dp11425
g2
VLook, don't say anything. Okay? It's no big deal. You're gonna go into the stasis pod until we\u2026figure out how to fix you.
p11426
sg4
I23
sa(dp11427
g2
V(agitated) Right. All set.
p11428
sg4
I4
sa(dp11429
g2
V(agitated) Right, well you won't feel a thing\u2014aside from a-a cool burst when the pod first activates. And now your, uh, life-signs will be monitored on this machine here, 24/7.
p11430
sg4
I30
sa(dp11431
g2
V(nervously) You know, I was-was\u2026toying with the idea of-of programming dreams into these things. Interested? I could have you fishing in the Highlands, um,\u2026with a couple of tall, blond massage therapists?
p11432
sg4
I31
sa(dp11433
g2
VThat's right, you will be. You know, 'cause this is not goodbye, this is, this is, uh\u2026this is: "see ya later." That's what we agreed.
p11434
sg4
I25
sa(dp11435
g2
VThat's how I remember it.
p11436
sg4
I5
sa(dp11437
g2
VOkay, when I say, go ahead and try the left one.
p11438
sg4
I11
sa(dp11439
g2
VOh! Geez! I said "when I say"!
p11440
sg4
I7
sa(dp11441
g2
VWell, we'd be making a lot more progress if Timmy Torture over here wasn't trying to kill me every two seconds.
p11442
sg4
I21
sa(dp11443
g2
VYes, I think so.
p11444
sg4
I4
sa(dp11445
g2
VYes, think.
p11446
sg4
I2
sa(dp11447
g2
VCorrection, I said "probably" do it.
p11448
sg4
I6
sa(dp11449
g2
VThis is unbelievably complex physics here, all right? I mean, it makes string theory look like non-linear dynamics.
p11450
sg4
I18
sa(dp11451
g2
VAnd even if I do get it working, there's still a thousand things that could go terribly, terribly wrong.
p11452
sg4
I19
sa(dp11453
g2
V(annoyed) Was there something else that you needed, or were you here merely to prod and belittle?
p11454
sg4
I17
sa(dp11455
g2
VI've been thinking about that.
p11456
sg4
I5
sa(dp11457
g2
VAnd, I think that if we stand any chance of succeeding, we're gonna need some help.
p11458
sg4
I16
sa(dp11459
g2
VThe nanites inside you? I think that if we got them in close proximity to the human-form Replicator city, I'd be able to manipulate them to remotely hack into the Replicator mainframe.
p11460
sg4
I32
sa(dp11461
g2
VWell, not only that, we'd be able to track their movement as well.
p11462
sg4
I13
sa(dp11463
g2
VOh, far from it. But\u2026
p11464
sg4
I5
sa(dp11465
g2
VWell, they won't. I would block any attempt\u2014
p11466

I8
sa(dp11467
g2
V(reluctantly) Yes.
p11468
sg4
I2
sa(dp11469

VShe's right. If we don't get hold of a ZPM, this city and everyone in it will\u2014
p11470
sg4
I17
sa(dp11471
g2
V(panicking) What? Wait. No-no-no-no-no. Not right now. Look, I haven't finished finalizing the power distrib\u2014
p11472
sg4
I15
sa(dp11473

VAll right. Now.
p11474

VRadek!
p11478
sg4
I1
sa(dp11479
g2
V(pleased) Okay.
p11480
sg4
I2
sa(dp11481
g2
VI think we got it.
p11482
sg4
I5
sa(dp11483
g2
VYes. Look. I'm still not sure this is going to work. I mean, I've done everything I can to\u2026make it\u2014
p11484
sg4
I20
sa(dp11485
g2
VDid I mention that this might not work? And that we could either drop out of hyperspace prematurely and end up stranded in the middle of deep space or quite possibly, be vaporized the moment I touch that\u2014
p11486
sg4
I38
sa(dp11487
g2
VYeah, I'm ready.
p11488

p11490
sg4
I6
sa(dp11491
g2
V(raising a finger) Unfortunately, believe it or not, Zelenka was actually right. We burned up way more power on the jump than we expected.
p11492
sg4
I24
sa(dp11493
g2
VNo, no, what I'm saying is that the\u2026actually, that's exactly what I'm saying.
p11494
sg4
I13
sa(dp11495
g2
VI suppose once we steal the ZPM, I could utilize its power. Then I need to make sure that I don't overload the main\u2014
p11496
sg4
I24
sa(dp11497
g2
VRight. (to Weir) Okay, I-I'm going to try to initialize the link.
p11498
sg4
I12
sa(dp11499
g2
VNothing. Just sit there. It's completely wireless. Let me know if anything pops into your mind.
p11500
sg4
I16
sa(dp11501
g2
VI did it! I mean, well\u2026she did it.
p11502
sg4
I8
sa(dp11503
g2
VBut we need to move fast. Even though Elizabeth's nanites are only in lurking mode, it won't take long for the Replicators to figure out another player has joined the game.
p11504
sg4
I31
sa(dp11505
g2
VReally? You-you know that?
p11506
sg4
I4
sa(dp11507
g2
V(over radio) Probably, but they've got dozens of ZPMs. Let's just hope that they don't\u2026notice until we're long gone.
p11508
sg4
I19
sa(dp11509
g2
VWait a minute, we can't go.
p11510
sg4
I6
sa(dp11511
g2
VI mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected, I-I've been going over the Replicators' base code, and I found this.
p11512
sg4
I24
sa(dp11513
g2
V(excited) The Holy Grail. It's their whole reason for being. It's a command code that directs them to attack the Wraith.
p11514
sg4
I21
sa(dp11515
g2
VWell, that's because it's been deactivated.
p11516
sg4
I6
sa(dp11517
g2
VWell, I have no idea. Look, maybe the Ancients did it when they realized they couldn't control them.
p11518
sg4
I18
sa(dp11519
g2
VThis is just one in millions of commands in the base code. Look, I always had a hunch that something like this might be in there, but-but, believe me, it was not easy to find.
p11520
sg4
I35
sa(dp11521
g2
VYes. But there's a problem. Look, I can reprogram the nanites in your brain and use that link to upload the changes, but we'll need to wait for the next merge to affect all the Replicators at once, and\u2026we have no idea when that could be. Not only that, but the instant it happens, they'll know you're there, they'll take immediate steps to assimilate you.
p11522
sg4
I65
sa(dp11523
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. There may be another way. There's a central data core. Look, it-it-it's kind of like a\u2026backup hard drive for all the Replicators. If I can upload the reactivated attack command directly into that, then we wouldn't need to use Elizabeth. We could\u2026be halfway back to Atlantis when the attack command takes effect at the next merge.
p11524
sg4
I61
sa(dp11525
g2
VYeah. There is one small problem\u2026which is not actually a small problem.
p11526
sg4
I12
sa(dp11527
g2
VI-I don't think we'll have another chance.
p11528
sg4

VYes, by interfacing the ARG's control crystal with the jumper's cloaking generator. The only question is how far I can widen the field. (to Sheppard)  Look, go ahead and fly us as close to the center of the city as possible.
p11532
sg4
I41
sa(dp11533
g2
VYes, we will. The anti-replicator field will protect us. That is\u2026assuming that I can extend the field wide enough to encompass not only the jumper, but also the core room, and\u2026also assuming that we can run fast enough to get there, input the command, and get back before the Replicators figure out how to overrun the field and-and-and\u2026you know, slaughter us.

VI'm sorry, what?
p11536

V(blankly) What?
p11554
sg4
I2
sa(dp11555
g2
VAll right, here we go.
p11556
sg4
I5
sa(dp11557

VDamn right it's working. It's encompassed the core room. You're good to go.

VWhat, you don't believe me, but you believe her?!
p11560
sg4
I9
sa(dp11561
g2
VOffense taken!
p11562
sg4
I2
sa(dp11563
g2
VOkay, I've written a basic block-storage transport protocol to upload the attack command directly from this tablet into the core. All you need to do is plug this cable into the main circuit and it'll automatically configure and upload the command.
p11564
sg4
I41
sa(dp11565
g2
VYou wanted simple.
p11566
sg4
I3
sa(dp11567
g2
VWell, we created that adapter to interface with Ancient tech, which the Replicators love to imitate, so, uh, you shouldn't have a problem there. Now, you need to move fast, because as soon as they find out what we're up to, they're gonna figure out a way around it.
p11568

g2
V(into radio) Good. Make sure to stay behind it.
p11570
sg4
I9
sa(dp11571
g2
V(into radio) Indeed it is. Okay, there should be an open slot at the control panel you can plug the cable into.
p11572
sg4
I22
sa(dp11573
g2
V(confused, into radio) Oh, it is? Why am I not reading anything? Are you sure you plugged it in the right slot?!

p11578
sg4
I10
sa(dp11579
g2
V(into radio) Still nothing. Look, what did you do?!
p11580
sg4
I9
sa(dp11581
g2
V(over radio) It's not working because the core is not recognizing the tablet.
p11582

g2
V(into radio) Look, I don't know!
p11584
sg4
I6
sa(dp11585
g2
V(into radio) Okay, you're going to need to implement adjustments in the negotiation protocol to exploit parallelism at the device interface.
p11586
sg4
I21
sa(dp11587
g2
V(over radio) Just do what I say. Start by unplugging the cable. Now access the tablet's root directory.
p11588
sg4
I18
sa(dp11589
g2
VWe're not done!
p11590
sg4
I3
sa(dp11591
g2
VThey've figured out how to override it. Look, we need to move much faster. You need to make changes to the negotiation protocol to allow for direct data placement. We need to allow for re-synchronization of the packet boundaries within the data stream.
p11592
sg4
I43
sa(dp11593
g2
VWell, how far is he? Can they make a run for it?
p11594

p11616
sg4
I7
sa(dp11617
g2
V(panicking) I-I'm not getting confirmation. And don't ask why, because I don't know, okay?! I mean, the last time she had active nanites inside her, she was able to exert a certain amount control. Maybe\u2026maybe she's doing it here now? Or maybe there's interference that's affecting the frequency? I don't know. I need to run a diagnostic.
p11618

g2
VWell, it wasn't me. It might have been Elizabeth.
p11624
sg4
I9
sa(dp11625
g2
VI don't know. I mean, she'd have to link directly with the Replicator collective, which means, the chances they'll be able to take over her nanites has just increased exponentially.
p11626
sg4
I30
sa(dp11627

VInformation?
p11640

g2
V(over radio) For the moment, maybe.
p11644
sg4
I6

VElizabeth?
p11650
sg4
I1
sa(dp11651

VNo. Not yet. No, we-we drained too much power trying to convert the cloak into an AR field. Look, I-I'll try to interface the ZPM, but we're gonna need some time.
p11652
sg4
I31
sa(dp11653

VHere's a good one. M35-117.
p11666
sg4
I5
sa(dp11667
g2
VWell, it's not on our primary or our backup lists. I purposely searched for planets we'd never considered before. The, uh, Replicators can probe her mind all they want, they won't find it.
p11668
sg4
I33
sa(dp11669

g2
VOkay. Here we go.
p11674
sg4
I4
sa(dp11675
g2
VWell, there's still the small matter of landing this thing.
p11676
sg4
I10
sa(dp11677
g2
VThere better be. What, a city this size will create considerable friction. We come in too fast or too steep, and the shield could attenuate under the stress and the whole place could be torn to shreds, or-or burn up, or both?
p11678
sg4
I42
sa(dp11679
g2
VWhat?
p11680
sg4
I1
sa(dp11681
g2
VThe angle's too steep. We keep going like this, we're gonna put too much strain on the shield, which means more power draining from the ZPM. (into radio) Sheppard, we're coming in too steep. You need to ease up on the angle of reentry.
p11682
sg4
I44
sa(dp11683
g2
V(over comm) Ease up on the angle.
p11684

VHang on!
p11688

p11730
sg4

p11732
sg4

VMmm. That's because you remember me the, uh, the way I was.
p11734
sg4
I12
sa(dp11735
g2
V(musing) Ah, it's funny, you know? I've spent the last twenty-five years of my life trying to figure out how to make this work, and I never once thought what I was going to say to you when you got here.
p11736
sg4
I41
sa(dp11737
g2
VRight, right. Okay, um\u2026remember that mission report? SG-1 stepped through the 'gate. Their wormhole accidentally intersected with a solar flare, and they were sent back to 1969?
p11738

I27
sa(dp11739
g2
VWell, something similar has just happened to you.
p11740

VUh, no. In fact, you were sent forward, into the future.
p11742
sg4
I11
sa(dp11743

g2
VAll right, calm down.
p11752
sg4
I4
sa(dp11753
g2
VDead. Dead and buried and turned to dust a long, long time ago. Along with everyone you ever knew. There's no way of knowing what the state of human civilization is, whether it even\u2026still exists. I mean, we've obviously abandoned this city.
p11754
sg4
I42
sa(dp11755
g2
VThere's not enough power for you to 'gate back to Earth. And without a MALP, going anywhere else would be far too risky. It is entirely possible that you are the last human being alive.
p11756
sg4
I35
sa(dp11757

VOh, consider yourself lucky, young man. While I was figuring out this plan, I had no way of knowing whether the city would even survive this long.
p11758
sg4
I27
sa(dp11759

VI took advantage of some progress in hologram technology to create this simulation. I'm able to move anywhere inside the city. I'm fully interactive, and I'm designed to mimic the exact response and appearance of the great Doctor Rodney McKay.
p11760
sg4
I40
sa(dp11761
g2
VFunny. Um\u2026I'm linked to the city's main systems, but I have an independent core drive which is sealed in the foundation of one of the outer buildings along with a Mark XII naquadah generator and a couple of other, uh, well, key components. It's kind of like a, um, well, what would you say\u2026? Like a time capsule, so to speak.
p11762

p11768
sg4
I4
sa(dp11769
g2
VTheoretically, we can send you back exactly the way you got here, using the 'gate, the right address, and a solar flare. Only problem is, we're waiting for something very specific, a prominence with exactly the right shape, size, characteristics, and relative position in space so that it will interact with the wormhole in exactly the right manner, and send you back exactly the right amount of time.
p11770
sg4
I68
sa(dp11771

VExactly.
p11772

VOh, seven, eight hundred years. A thousand tops.
p11774
sg4
I8
sa(dp11775

p11776
sg4
I25
sa(dp11777
g2
VThings didn't exactly go well for us after your disappearance. Once I figured out what happened to you, I realized there was nothing we could do. The Air Force pronounced you KIA\u2014gave you a-a very nice military funeral back on Earth. Obviously, the casket was empty, but, uh, you know\u2026it's the thought that counts. Heh. From there, well\u2026 From there, things went from bad to worse.
p11778
sg4
I66
sa(dp11779
g2
V(voiceover) We kept searching for Teyla, but we just didn't have the resources to cover enough ground. It took us two months before we finally found her, in one of Michael's hideouts. But by then it was too late.
p11780
sg4
I39
sa(dp11781
g2
V(sadly) She'd had the baby. I guess\u2026after that, he didn't have any use for her anymore\u2026So he killed her.

p11784

p11786
sg4
I35
sa(dp11787
g2
V(animated) Well, it was the turning point. It was the key to everything. Once Michael had that baby, he was able to complete his research and perfect the hybrids.
p11788
sg4
I29
sa(dp11789
g2
V(voiceover) After that, well, he really kicked things into gear.
p11790
sg4
I10
sa(dp11791
g2
V(voiceover) He stepped up his campaign of exposing human populations to the Hoffan drug. Jennifer did her best to find a way to combat the effects and was trying to lower the mortality rate, but ultimately, it was a losing battle.
p11792
sg4
I41
sa(dp11793
g2
V(voiceover) With their food supplies tainted, the infighting between the Wraith factions got worse. Michael waited until they were at each other's throats\u2026and then he made his move.
p11794
sg4
I28
sa(dp11795
g2
V(voiceover) He took advantage of their weakened state and their internal divisions, and in less than a year, he had the Wraith on their knees. Literally.
p11796
sg4
I26
sa(dp11797
g2
VWith the Wraith in disarray, Michael returned to the human populations he'd infected with the Hoffan drug. He selected the strongest and the healthiest of the survivors and converted them to hybrids. The rest he exterminated.

VOh. Oh, then-then you know what that means.
p11820
sg4
I8
sa(dp11821
g2
VThe winds are gusting over fifty miles an hour and increasing. The visibility's basically zero. You can't go out there. You're just gonna have to wait it out.
p11822
sg4
I28
sa(dp11823
g2
VWell, I don't know. Maybe a couple of hours?
p11824
sg4
I9
sa(dp11825
g2
V(concerned) Are you hungry? Do you have any food?
p11826
sg4
I9
sa(dp11827
g2
VAw, well, I suppose it doesn't really matter anyways. We'll just wait for the storm to blow over and have you out of here in no time at all. Well, you'll actually be here for 700 years, but, uh\u2026you know what I mean.
p11828
sg4
I43
sa(dp11829
g2
V(quietly) No.
p11830
sg4
I2
sa(dp11831
g2
VThe IOA and the military were reluctant to commit a lot of resources to protecting the human populations of another galaxy. But Sam..? Heh. Sam wouldn't take no for an answer.
p11832
sg4
I31
sa(dp11833
g2
V(voiceover) Finally, they decided to give her a new ship, the Phoenix. It was barely off the assembly line. Half the Asgard systems weren't finished, the other half\u2026weren't working.
p11834
sg4
I29
sa(dp11835
g2
V(voiceover) We spent the better part of a month getting her ready for combat. We worked day and night, side by side. Zelenka might have been there as well, I don't really remember.
p11836
sg4
I33
sa(dp11837
g2
V(voiceover) I do remember never feeling so drained in my entire life.
p11838
sg4
I12
sa(dp11839
g2
V(voiceover) Eventually though, we managed to get her in working order.
p11840
sg4
I11
sa(dp11841
g2
VAll right, everything checks out. Weapons, shields, long-range sensors, all in the green. She's good to go.
p11842
sg4
I17
sa(dp11843
g2
VWell, what about you?
p11844
sg4
I4
sa(dp11845
g2
VYou need to take some time. You're as exhausted as we are!
p11846
sg4
I12
sa(dp11847
g2
V(petulantly) Well, so let someone else go!
p11848
sg4
I7
sa(dp11849
g2
VRight.
p11850
sg4
I1
sa(dp11851
g2
VHmm?
p11852
sg4
I1
sa(dp11853
g2
V(shrugging) Uh\u2026Good luck?
p11854
sg4
I3
sa(dp11855
g2
V(voiceover) They started a series of hit-and-run ops, real guerrilla style.
p11856
sg4
I11
sa(dp11857
g2
VFor a while, it really worked. They were able to inflict, uh, considerable damage despite terrible odds. But, eventually, their luck ran out.
p11858
sg4
I23
sa(dp11859
g2
V(voiceover) Michael deliberately leaked some intel that he was about to attack a heavily populated human world. Sam thought she could get there first\u2026but she was wrong.
p11860
sg4
I27
sa(dp11861
g2
V(voiceover) After she got the crew off, she must have lost the transport system. With her engines about to go critical, I guess she figured she didn't have anything to lose.
p11862
sg4
I31
sa(dp11863
g2
V(voiceover) With her last breath, she took out three of Michael's hive ships.
p11864
sg4
I13
sa(dp11865
g2
V(with wistful smile) And we buried another empty casket.
p11866
sg4
I9
sa(dp11867
g2
VI was inputting our\u2026new solar flare requirements into the long-range sensors, and\u2026I found out what happened to the ocean.
p11868
sg4
I19
sa(dp11869
g2
V(fiercely) The sun in this system is dying! It's running out of fuel.
p11870
sg4
I13
sa(dp11871
g2
VNo. As it consumes the heavier elements, it begins to expand. It-it's basically turning into a red giant.
p11872
sg4
I18
sa(dp11873
g2
VNo, no. You don't get it. This isn't some kind of\u2026cyclical climate change. This is-this is a one-way ticket. This planet is going to get hotter and hotter. Eventually the atmosphere is going to burn off.
p11874
sg4
I36
sa(dp11875
g2
VIt is impossible to say, but my best estimate is under five hundred years.
p11876
sg4
I14
sa(dp11877
g2
VRight. So the moment you step out of the stasis chamber, you'll be killed.
p11878
sg4
I14
sa(dp11879
g2
V(frustrated) I am trying! It's like I said\u2026
p11880
sg4
I8
sa(dp11881
g2
VTheoretically, but\u2026there would never be enough power left over to maintain my systems, the long-range sensors, the stasis chamber\u2026
p11882
sg4
I19
sa(dp11883
g2
V(caustically) Yes, which would come in very handy if we were trying to power a couple of electric golf carts.
p11884
sg4
I20
sa(dp11885
g2
VI can't really help that! Look, what are you saying?
p11886
sg4
I10
sa(dp11887
g2
VOh my god. That could work. We'll use the shields to protect the atmosphere.
p11888
sg4
I14
sa(dp11889
g2
VWe wouldn't be able to do it indefinitely, but it would buy us a hundred years or so.
p11890
sg4
I18
sa(dp11891
g2
VWhat about the storm?
p11892
sg4
I4
sa(dp11893
g2
VIt'll be dark soon.
p11894
sg4
I4
sa(dp11895
g2
VThat may not be as easy as you think.
p11896
sg4
I9
sa(dp11897
g2
VAll right. Look, I can't go outside, but I-I can stay in contact with you over the radio.
p11898
sg4
I18
sa(dp11899
g2
V(calling after him) Like you said, just keep walking in a straight line. You'll hit the building on the other side. Just feel your way to the door. I'll be waiting for you there!
p11900
sg4
I34
sa(dp11901
g2
V(into radio, worried) Sheppard? Sheppard can you hear me?
p11902
sg4
I9
sa(dp11903
g2
V(over radio) How you doing?
p11904
sg4
I5
sa(dp11905
g2
VYeah, I'm still here.
p11906
sg4
I4
sa(dp11907
g2
VWhat, now?
p11908
sg4
I2
sa(dp11909
g2
VRight. Uh\u2026well, after what happened to you, and\u2026and then Teyla, i guess he didn't feel comfortable on the base anymore.
p11910
sg4
I20
sa(dp11911
g2
V(voiceover) He persuaded Sam to let him go off-world and recruit a strike force. By this time, the galaxy was in a panic. Word was spreading that Michael's agenda was to wipe out Wraith and human alike. Ronon didn't have much trouble finding volunteers.
p11912
sg4
I44
sa(dp11913
g2
V(voiceover) They were just simple villagers with no military experience, but he trained them in all forms of combat. He even convinced Sam to let him have some of our equipment: radios, explosives, P-90s. It wasn't long before he had himself a pretty effective combat force.
p11914
sg4
I46
sa(dp11915
g2
V(voiceover) They ran a few successful ops against some of Michael's ground facilities, and then one day\u2026they got key piece of intel.
p11916
sg4
I22
sa(dp11917
g2
V(voiceover) Michael had taken over a Wraith lab and was using it to create more of his hybrids.
p11918
sg4
I18
sa(dp11919
g2
V(voiceover) They decided to take it out.
p11920
sg4
I7
sa(dp11921
g2
V(voiceover) That's when they ran into someone\u2026unexpected.
p11922
sg4
I7
sa(dp11923
g2
V(heartbroken) I'm sorry. I\u2026I wish some of these stories had happier endings\u2026Sheppard? Sheppard! Are you still with me? Sheppard!
p11924
sg4
I19
sa(dp11925
g2
VYour bio-signature's barely registering! Sheppard!
p11926
sg4
I5
sa(dp11927
g2
VOh, god.
p11928
sg4
I2
sa(dp11929
g2
V(encouragingly) There you go. You can do it.
p11930
sg4
I8
sa(dp11931
g2
VI'm still here. Look, I'd help you out, but I-I-I'm\u2026uh\u2026
p11932
sg4
I10
sa(dp11933
g2
VAll night. Look, you don't look so good. Maybe we should get you in the stasis chamber as soon as possible.
p11934
sg4
I21
sa(dp11935
g2
VI've already prepped the solar panels. You're good to go.
p11936
sg4
I10
sa(dp11937
g2
VHere. Take the first crystal. I've loaded all the intel we got on Michael after your disappearance\u2026including the address where we found Teyla.
p11938
sg4
I23
sa(dp11939
g2
V(uncomfortable) Oh, you don't want to hear about that.
p11940
sg4
I9
sa(dp11941
g2
VOnly because I quit.
p11942
sg4
I4
sa(dp11943
g2
VAtlantis. Stargate Command. The whole thing.
p11944
sg4
I6
sa(dp11945
g2
VYeah. Well, we were under new management.
p11946
sg4
I7
sa(dp11947
g2
V(voiceover) I was down in the infirmary, having suffered a, uh\u2026well, pretty serious injury.
p11948
sg4
I14
sa(dp11949
g2
VThat doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
p11950
sg4
I6
sa(dp11951
g2
VYeah, I can see that.
p11952
sg4
I5
sa(dp11953
g2
V(unimpressed) Mister Woolsey. I understand you've managed to get yourself appointed our new commander.
p11954
sg4
I14
sa(dp11955
g2
VWhat about Michael?
p11956
sg4
I3
sa(dp11957
g2
V(defensively) Sheppard is not dead.
p11958
sg4
I5
sa(dp11959
g2
V(voiceover) The idea of standing by and doing nothing while the rest of the galaxy was suffering was\u2026was too much for Jennifer to take. The more I thought about it, the more I realized she was right.
p11960
sg4
I37
sa(dp11961
g2
VNo. I've come here to tell you I'm leaving, too.
p11962
sg4
I10
sa(dp11963
g2
V(voiceover) We had three weeks on the Daedalus with nothing else to think about but everything that had happened.
p11964
sg4
I19
sa(dp11965
g2
V(voiceover) We went over it a thousand times, trying to imagine what we might have done differently. It was awful. At least we had each other.
p11966
sg4
I26
sa(dp11967
g2
V(voiceover) By the time we got back to Earth, well, uh, we weren't just colleagues any more.
p11968
sg4
I17
sa(dp11969
g2
V(affronted) Why do you find that so surprising?
p11970
sg4
I8
sa(dp11971
g2
VThat's what I'm counting on.
p11972
sg4
I5
sa(dp11973
g2
VNo\u2026no at first, it was great.
p11974
sg4
I6
sa(dp11975
g2
V(voiceover) I got a high-paying job with an aerospace engineering firm. Jennifer started her own practice. Things were just starting to come together.
p11976
sg4
I23
sa(dp11977
g2
V(voiceover) We should've known we wouldn't get off so easy.
p11978
sg4
I10
sa(dp11979
g2
V(voiceover) Of course, no regular doctor could diagnose what was wrong with her. We wound up back at Stargate Command less than a year after we'd left. Complications due to repeated exposure to the Hoffan drug. No cure.
p11980
sg4
I38
sa(dp11981
g2
V(voiceover) I thought I was going to lose my mind. I didn't know what to do. After everything we'd been through, to have this happen was too much. And that's when I had my idea.
p11982
sg4
I35
sa(dp11983
g2
V(excited) Hey.
p11984
sg4
I2
sa(dp11985
g2
VI've been working!
p11986
sg4
I3
sa(dp11987
g2
VThe solution. To everything. Well, you. This. All of this! I mean, Atlantis, Pegasus, Michael\u2026everything!
p11988
sg4
I15
sa(dp11989
g2
VI'm going to change the timeline. I'm going to make it so none of this ever happened. I mean, you won't get sick, Teyla won't die, Michael won't complete his research, none of it.
p11990
sg4
I34
sa(dp11991
g2
VOkay, I've already worked out the basic plan. I mean, the details will be a bit more complicated. I'll probably have to create a whole new form of math just to do the calculations, but I-I know I can do it.
p11992
sg4
I41
sa(dp11993
g2
VNo, you can. I can! And I'm going to\u2026even if it takes the rest of my life.
p11994
sg4
I17
sa(dp11995
g2
V(confused) Well, why not?
p11996
sg4
I4
sa(dp11997
g2
V(petulantly) Well, I do! I've got a whole boatload of them, and I want to do something about it.
p11998
sg4
I19
sa(dp11999
g2
V(voiceover) But I couldn't let it go. She died three days later.
p12000
sg4
I12
sa(dp12001
g2
V(voiceover) I quit the research firm. Took a job teaching physics at a local community college. Not much money, but it gave me the free time I needed.
p12002
sg4
I28
sa(dp12003
g2
V(voiceover) I'll admit it wasn't much of a life. Jeanie came by every once in a while to check up on me. When she realized she wasn't going to be able to convince me to stop, she decided to pitch in and help me with the calculations.
p12004
sg4
I47
sa(dp12005
g2
VIt's obviously nothing. I did that yesterday. Look\u2014
p12006
sg4
I8
sa(dp12007
g2
VLook, look, this is what I'm thinking about doing\u2026
p12008
sg4
I9
sa(dp12009
g2
V(voiceover) Eventually, even she got fed up. I never wavered.
p12010
sg4
I10
sa(dp12011
g2
V(voiceover) Years went by, twenty-five years to be exact. And suddenly I had it.
p12012
sg4
I14
sa(dp12013
g2
V(voiceover) There was only one problem. I needed to get back to Atlantis. I didn't have a lot of friends at Stargate Command, but I only needed one.
p12014
sg4
I28
sa(dp12015
g2
VGeneral Lorne.
p12016
sg4
I2
sa(dp12017
g2
VYou didn't tell anyone else, did you?
p12018
sg4
I7
sa(dp12019
g2
VWell then, don't. You don't have to tell them what it is. I mean, tell them it's a research project. Tell them whatever the hell you want.
p12020
sg4
I27
sa(dp12021
g2
VLet's cut to the chase. You saw what happened in Pegasus. You know what's happening here. You really think this is the way it's supposed to be?
p12022
sg4
I27
sa(dp12023
g2
VMaybe he felt sorry for me, maybe he figured it wasn't going to work anyway, but\u2026he let me through. The rest, you know.
p12024
sg4
I23
sa(dp12025
g2
VOkay, we're ready.
p12026
sg4
I3
sa(dp12027
g2
VNow if this works, I'll be waiting right here when you come out. We don't have much time to get you through the 'gate, but I think we can manage it.
p12028
sg4
I31
sa(dp12029
g2
VWell, you won't feel a thing. Basically, you just won't wake up.
p12030
sg4
I12
sa(dp12031
g2
VOh, uh, afraid not.
p12032
sg4
I4
sa(dp12033
g2
V(shaking his head) I was never really much of a sports fan.
p12034
sg4
I12
sa(dp12035
g2
VGood luck, John.
p12036
sg4
I3
sa(dp12037
g2
VOkay\u2026
p12038
sg4
I1
sa(dp12039
g2
V(over radio) Sam, believe it or not, I found it.
p12040
sg4
I10
sa(dp12041
g2
VIt's in the sensor log. It's a solar flare capable of interfering with the wormhole from M4S-587 at exactly the moment that Lorne says he dialed.
p12042
sg4
I26
sa(dp12043
g2
V(awkwardly) Uh\u2026Well, we've had a number of glitches since we, uh, last updated the operating system.
p12044
sg4
I16
sa(dp12045
g2
VYes, well\u2026you should know that, uh, I'll be giving Zelenka a stern talking to.
p12046
sg4
I14
sa(dp12047
g2
V(to Sheppard) Look, um, I know you've already been debriefed about the, uh, future events, all the things we're hoping to avoid, but there's just one more thing I need to know.
p12048
sg4
I32
sa(dp12049
g2
VDo I still have hair?
p12050
sg4
I5
sa(dp12051
g2
V(into radio) Hold on. Yeah\u2026.yeah, I got some kind of a-a data terminal. Let me see if I can power it up and hack in.
p12052
sg4
I25
sa(dp12053
g2
V(into radio) What is it?
p12054
sg4
I5
sa(dp12055
g2
VHold on. I'm in.
p12056
sg4
I4
sa(dp12057
g2
VWhoa! Jackpot.
p12058
sg4
I2
sa(dp12059
g2
VI got everything. I've got gate addresses. I've got subspace communication codes. I've even got his research into the hybrids. He's history!
p12060
sg4
I22
sa(dp12061
g2
VNo, no, no. No, no, no, no. What happened?
p12062
sg4
I9
sa(dp12063
g2
VOh, no\u2026
p12064
sg4
I2
sa(dp12065
g2
VIt's a countdown.
p12066
sg4
I3
sa(dp12067
g2
VHmm. Heard the rumor?
p12068
sg4
I4
sa(dp12069
g2
VOh. Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
p12070
sg4
I7
sa(dp12071
g2
VWell, there's been no formal announcement, but, uh, word is they're going with their foremost expert in Ancient technology and Replicator activity. Who does that sound like to you?
p12072
sg4
I29
sa(dp12073
g2
VYes. Who else?
p12074
sg4
I3
sa(dp12075
g2
VAnd why not? It's about time that one of us ended up in a position of real power.
p12076
sg4
I18
sa(dp12077
g2
VExactly.
p12078
sg4
I1
sa(dp12079
g2
VIt's kind of scary though. You know, I'll be making decisions that don't affect just the city, but the entire galaxy.
p12080
sg4
I21
sa(dp12081
g2
VOn the other hand, a leader never second-guesses himself. I'm up for the challenge. I know I am. I'm going to make them proud. Radek, I'm going to make you proud.
p12082
sg4
I31
sa(dp12083

VHey!
p12084

V(into comm) Sam. Uh, what's new?
p12086
sg4
I6
sa(dp12087
g2
VYou don't have to tell me, I already know.
p12088
sg4
I9
sa(dp12089
g2
VI just want to say that I think the IOA could not have made a better choice.
p12090
sg4
I17
sa(dp12091
g2
V(into comm) No, no, no, no, no. You are too kind\u2026what?
p12092
sg4
I11
sa(dp12093
g2
VUh\u2026"Thank you, Rodney." No, no, no\u2026wait a minute, you mean the\u2026
p12094
sg4
I11
sa(dp12095
g2
V(weakly) Huh.
p12096
sg4
I2
sa(dp12097
g2
VIt's a selection of fruits from the various worlds that we trade with. I thought it'd be thoughtful.
p12098
sg4
I18
sa(dp12099
g2
V(annoyed) Really? And what would you suggest?
p12100
sg4
I7
sa(dp12101

VHmm. Flowers.
p12102
sg4
I2

p12104

p12118
sg4
I37
sa(dp12119
g2
VI'm, uh, seeing someone. Yes, I-I only bring it up now because you're here now, and we'll be working together a lot more, and uh, you know, I just thought with our past\u2026
p12120
sg4
I33
sa(dp12121

VWell, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.
p12122

p12132
sg4
I11
sa(dp12133
g2
VStill, she did say "undermanned", rather than "unmanned". There is a big difference.
p12134
sg4
I13
sa(dp12135
g2
VAnd I really don't see why we would. I mean, sure it would be great to get our hands on some new Wraith tech, but um, maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile, or-or maybe bought off of E-bay, but\u2014
p12136
sg4
I40
sa(dp12137
g2
VThe code's been deactivated once before. I mean, who knows? It could've been the Wraith who did it the first time.
p12138
sg4
I21
sa(dp12139
g2
VUh, maybe you could be a little more specific?
p12140
sg4

VOh, and we don't? This isn't exactly our first op, you know.
p12142
sg4
I12

VI hardly think that's what this is about.

p12160

I13
sa(dp12161

V(groaning) Oh, not really. Ronon's buddies are the reason we're here; they set us up.
p12162
sg4
I15
sa(dp12163
g2
VI ran into them while I was trying to esc\u2014while I was effecting a strategic retreat. They stunned me.

p12170
sg4
I3
sa(dp12171
g2
VWould you guys mind telling me where we're going? Seriously, I-I'm not big on surprises. Even as a kid, I had to sneak a peek at my Christmas presents because I couldn't stand the suspense. I remember this one time I had this\u2014

sa(dp12173

p12174

VI don't know what you're talking about.
p12176
sg4

sa(dp12177
g2
VOkay, I may have made a few small adjustments. So what?
p12178
sg4
I11
sa(dp12179

VSo it was the Wraith that deactivated the attack code!

p12186

p12210

p12216

I20
sa(dp12217
g2
VNo. I-I think it's a little bit more than that. Look, I don't really remember. That's not the point. Nothing. No information at all. I say, that has to mean something.
p12218
sg4
I31

VOr there is, but the Ancients are trying to hide it.
p12220
sg4
I11
sa(dp12221

g2
VYou realize what this means?
p12232
sg4
I5
sa(dp12233
g2
VHow 'bout a power source that literally grows on trees. Look, admittedly, these energy readings are pretty low level, but uh, if these crystals could be cultivated? Then\u2026whoa-whoa, wait. What are you doing?
p12234
sg4
I33

VTeyla had a dream about you last night.
p12254
sg4
I8
sa(dp12255
g2
V(scoffing) Really? You think you can't control a person's dreams? My father read me Moby Dick when I was seven years old. I mean, seriously, what was the man thinking? Do you have any idea how long I had nightmares about-about being eaten by a whale?
p12256

I46
sa(dp12257
g2
VNo.
p12258
sg4

VI still remember the first time I saw it. I certainly did not think it was cool.
p12260
sg4
I17
sa(dp12261
g2
VHmm. Well I never saw it as a kid. I knew from the poster it was gonna be too scary. No, I was sixteen when a uh, neighborhood theater, had a, uh, horror revival festival.

VAnyway. I eat when I get nervous.
p12266

VMmm. So\u2026very tense. Working like a charm. Jocelyn's all freaked out beside me. I'm packin' away the Goobers and the popcorn. And then, the alien bursts out of John Hurt.

p12272

p12274
sg4
I21
sa(dp12275
g2
V(irked) Wait! And listen! Turns out she was serving lemon chicken. I mean, lemon! And the only reason she invited me to dinner was to tell me that she was promoting Zelenka over me.
p12276
sg4
I34
sa(dp12277
g2
V(squirming) Then I was eaten by a whale. Don't ask how that happened.

VI'm good right here, thank you.
p12280
sg4
I6

p12282

I24
sa(dp12283
g2
VWhat? Why would we do that?
p12284
sg4
I6
sa(dp12285
g2
VBut, uh, you said, no more 'gate travel. I-I thought that was a wise decision.
p12286
sg4
I15
sa(dp12287
g2
VI mean, don't you think a science team would be better suited\u2026
p12288
sg4
I12
sa(dp12289

VOkay, fine. But it's a big planet, you know? We could really use some more manpower!
p12290

V(to Zelenka) Radek, we've got a live one here!

VThat's just what I was thinking.
p12302
sg4

VMmm. Once again, you've read my mind. However, when you're finished there, I say you give it a shot.
p12304
sg4
I19
sa(dp12305
g2
VAnd having an active, uh, crystal allows us to, uh, calibrate these hand-held sensors to, uh, detect the energy signatures associated with it.
p12306
sg4
I23
sa(dp12307
g2
VAs long as it doesn't know what we're up to. Otherwise, you'd think it would just, uh, transfer out of somebody before we could scan them.
p12308
sg4
I26
sa(dp12309

VIt's demonstrated some, uh, pretty sophisticated intelligence so far. It could have basic avoidance skills.

p12328

p12378
sg4
I3
sa(dp12379
g2
VYou know, since I've been in Pegasus, I have set up, like what, half a dozen research stations on various planets? And I don't remember you ever volunteering to run a resupply mission to any of them.
p12380

sa(dp12381

p12382

p12384
sg4
I4
sa(dp12385
g2
VWas it Wraith?
p12386
sg4
I3
sa(dp12387
g2
V(frantic) Can you make it back to the 'gate? Sheppard?!
p12388
sg4
I10
sa(dp12389
g2
VI'm not entirely sure. It looks like Sheppard's jumper was attacked before it could reach the space gate.
p12390
sg4
I18
sa(dp12391
g2
VWell, the people on the planet aren't much past mud huts and blow darts, so I think we can assume they had nothing to do with it. What we do know that just before we lost contact, there was a short burst of radiation in the vicinity of the 'gate, consistent with the opening of a hyperspace window.
p12392
sg4
I58
sa(dp12393
g2
VSheppard didn't seem to think so, and what little sensor data we've been able to pick up from the jumper seems to confirm it. The energy signature's all wrong. It's inconsistent with Ancient technology as well, which pretty much rules out the Replicators.
p12394
sg4
I43
sa(dp12395
g2
VOf course not. No one reaches anywhere near that level of advancement without being culled.
p12396
sg4
I15
sa(dp12397
g2
VWe've got nothing. There's no wreckage, no transponder signal. If he was down there, we would've found him by now.
p12398
sg4
I20
sa(dp12399
g2
VWell, he's not in orbit, and he's not on the planet, so the only logical assumption is that whoever attacked him must've brought him on board before they jumped into hyperspace.
p12400
sg4
I31
sa(dp12401
g2
VThere is no next step! Look, we have no way of tracing him. He could be anywhere in the galaxy by now. I'm sorry, but sometimes there is just nothing we can do.
p12402
sg4
I33
sa(dp12403
g2
V(chipper) Ah. Remember how I said sometimes there's nothing we can do? Well, I was right about that. Only it only turns out, this is not one of those times.
p12404
sg4
I30
sa(dp12405
g2
VHmm. More like he found us. Listen to this.
p12406
sg4
I9
sa(dp12407
g2
VThat is the sound of subspace. Now, it's mostly just random noise generated by various forms of radiation. But the Ancients, in their infinite wisdom created a program that could sniff out artificial patterns. Now, it's, uh, no doubt a long-range means of detecting advanced life forms, kind of like our SETI program only much more powerful, because it operates through subspace. Anyway, it picked up this.
p12408
sg4
I67
sa(dp12409
g2
VThat's Sheppard. Now I don't know why he didn't just send a regular message. But maybe he was dealing with a damaged transmitter, or maybe he was trying to communicate without being detected. But it's definitely him.
p12410

sa(dp12417
g2
VThere.
p12418
sg4
I1
sa(dp12419
g2
VWell, it could be a ship. They're still too far too get any detailed readings, but that's gotta be them.
p12420
sg4
I20
sa(dp12421
g2
VIt's, uh, five hours.
p12422
sg4
I4
sa(dp12423
g2
VIt's no use. I've done everything I can think of to boost the sensors. They're still too far out.
p12424
sg4
I19
sa(dp12425
g2
VI don't think it's a coincidence that this system has a space gate. They were probably\u2026headed for it when they dropped out of hyperspace too early.
p12426
sg4
I26
sa(dp12427
g2
VHow should I know? We don't even know who "they " are, remember?
p12428
sg4
I13
sa(dp12429
g2
VAll right, close enough to do a full sensor sweep.
p12430
sg4
I10
sa(dp12431
g2
VLooks like we've got four ships, one of them Lantian design, Aurora-class.
p12432
sg4
I12
sa(dp12433
g2
VI don't recognize the configurations.
p12434
sg4
I5
sa(dp12435
g2
VWell, the logical assumption is that he's on board the ship that transmitted the signal.
p12436
sg4
I15
sa(dp12437
g2
VWell, I have no idea.
p12438
sg4
I5
sa(dp12439
g2
VHe's right. They could target us, or-or for that matter, they could just jump back into hyperspace. We'd be right back at square one.
p12440
sg4
I24
sa(dp12441
g2
V(resigned) All right-all right, well, I'll see if I can find a way to disable them.
p12442
sg4
I16
sa(dp12443
g2
VWe can target the Lantian ship's engines.
p12444
sg4
I7
sa(dp12445
g2
VLook, I've been going over the sensor data, but there's still too many unknowns. I mean, if you hit 'em in the wrong spot we could blow them out of the sky or the-or the drones could just bounce harmlessly off the shields. There's no way to know.
p12446
sg4
I48
sa(dp12447
g2
V(devastated) They're\u2026gone.
p12448
sg4
I2
sa(dp12449
g2
VI'm getting a contact. Huh. It's a jumper. One life sign.
p12450
sg4
I11
sa(dp12451
g2
VReally?
p12452
sg4
I1
sa(dp12453
g2
VNo, there's something you're not telling us\u2026She was hot, wasn't she?
p12454
sg4
I11
sa(dp12455
g2
VAw, I knew it! That is so typical!
p12456
sg4
I8
sa(dp12457
g2
V(still fuming) Whatever, all I know is that every time I get taken captive, it's the Wraith. Just once I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien.
p12458
sg4
I30
sa(dp12459
g2
VHey! Hey is anyone there?! Look, I need some help in here!
p12460
sg4
I12
sa(dp12461
g2
V(recorded video) All right, look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that. You need to focus! I'm sure you're wondering\u2026who tied you to the desk. Well, the truth is\u2026it was you. I mean\u2026me. I did it because I needed you to get this message. It would take too long to give you the full explanation, and you wouldn't remember it anyway, so you're just gonna have to just trust me on this. Now, you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair. Find it and cut yourself loose.
p12462
sg4
I97
sa(dp12463
g2
V(recorded video) Now\u2026I need you to listen. It is vitally important that you find this woman.
p12464
sg4
I16
sa(dp12465
g2
V(recorded video) I don't know where she is, but you have to find her. She can help. Uh, check the mess hall, or maybe they took her to the brig. I don't know. You just have to keep looking. Don't worry about anything else. And for god's sake, don't trust anyone. Just find her, and do it fast, because if you don't, hundreds of people are going to die, including you.

VHuh.
p12482
sg4
I1
sa(dp12483

p12484

g2
VOh!
p12486

V(nervously) Oh. No. Really. It's fine.
p12490

VAfter you.
p12492
sg4
I2

p12506

VIf you say so.
p12508

VNo-no. Slow down. What's going on here?
p12510

VTake us where? What soldiers? What is this place?
p12512

p12516

p12518
sg4
I10
sa(dp12519
g2
VI have to find her.
p12520
sg4
I5
sa(dp12521

p12522
sg4
I5
sa(dp12523

VWell, can we ask them?
p12524
sg4
I5
sa(dp12525
g2
VAgain with the taking away.
p12526
sg4
I5
sa(dp12527
g2
VI can't. I have to keep looking.
p12528
sg4
I7
sa(dp12529

VIt started suddenly, and then it just\u2026uh, it just stopped.
p12530

sa(dp12531
g2
VAren't you going to do anything?
p12532
sg4
I6
sa(dp12533
g2
VWell, it's a new symptom. I thought it might be important.
p12534
sg4
I11
sa(dp12535
g2
VYeah, but, so far. I'm just saying, we don't know anything about this disease.
p12536
sg4
I14
sa(dp12537
g2
VOh, she's gonna, uh, take it into consideration, thanked me for my input, and, uh. How you doin?
p12538
sg4
I18
sa(dp12539
g2
VWell, Doctor Keller's got her team working pretty hard. I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff. I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time.
p12540
sg4
I32
sa(dp12541
g2
V(concerned) Seriously, are you okay?
p12542
sg4
I5
sa(dp12543
g2
VAll right, look, is there anything I can do?
p12544
sg4
I9
sa(dp12545
g2
VWell, what's wrong with this one?
p12546
sg4
I6
sa(dp12547
g2
V(smiling) Hey! How you feeling?
p12548
sg4
I5
sa(dp12549
g2
VOh, well, they brought dinner. The salisbury steak's actually quite good. Oh, and by the way, I asked Doctor Keller about your friend Doctor Baxter. She says he's asleep, but apparently the fever's down.
p12550
sg4
I34
sa(dp12551
g2
VDoctor Baxter? That's his name, right? The\u2026guy on your team\u2026? Katie?
p12552
sg4
I11
sa(dp12553

VWhat do you mean? You're in the infirmary. I brought you here, remember?
p12554

VI don't want to cause any trouble, I just\u2026
p12556

p12558
sg4
I4
sa(dp12559
g2
VWho are all you people?
p12560
sg4
I5
sa(dp12561

VNothing. It was just\u2026empty hallways. How did I get here?
p12562
sg4
I10
sa(dp12563
g2
VWhy?
p12564
sg4
I1
sa(dp12565
g2
V(panicking) Why are they doing this to us? Look, why can't anyone remember? My\u2026computer. Where's my computer?
p12566
sg4
I17
sa(dp12567
g2
VI have to find someone. It's\u2026uh\u2026a woman. Teyla! Do you know who that is?
p12568
sg4
I14
sa(dp12569
g2
V(raising voice) Does anyone here know Teyla\u2026? Anyone\u2026?
p12570
sg4
I8
sa(dp12571
g2
VI have to remember somehow. I already feel certain things slipping away.
p12572
sg4
I12
sa(dp12573
g2
VGettin' out of here. (calling out to everyone) All right, everyone! Listen up! I need to escape as quickly as possible. Does anyone know how I can do that?
p12574
sg4
I29
sa(dp12575
g2
VWhy not?
p12576
sg4
I2
sa(dp12577

VWe're just going to have to deal with them. I'm sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust them.
p12578
sg4
I20
sa(dp12579
g2
VLook, something caused this to happen. All right? And we're not gonna figure it out from in here. Somewhere out there, there is a woman that\u2026a woman named\u2026
p12580
sg4
I28
sa(dp12581
g2
VTeyla, right. Thank you. I think she knows something.
p12582
sg4
I9
sa(dp12583
g2
VI don't know. We gotta get out there and find out.
p12584
sg4
I11
sa(dp12585
g2
VWell, the second set of random blood tests just came back, all positive. They didn't see much point in, uh, quarantining the infirmary anymore.
p12586
sg4
I24
sa(dp12587
g2
VHeadache?
p12588
sg4
I1
sa(dp12589
g2
VFive bucks says you start losing your memories first.
p12590
sg4
I9
sa(dp12591
g2
VAll right, well we may need to think about, uh, ordering all non-essential personnel to report to the mess hall. I mean, they're gonna wind up there anyway. And this way, we won't have people wandering the hallways.
p12592
sg4
I38
sa(dp12593
g2
VDo we know what's in these? Because, I'm allergic to a lot of\u2014
p12594
sg4
I13
sa(dp12595
g2
VAnd what happens when we all start losing our memory?
p12596
sg4
I10
sa(dp12597
g2
VOh thank god. My lungs were about to give out. So what next?
p12598
sg4
I13
sa(dp12599
g2
VWho?
p12600
sg4
I1
sa(dp12601
g2
VRight, right. I don't know.
p12602
sg4
I5
sa(dp12603

VDidn't we come this way before?
p12604
sg4
I6
sa(dp12605
g2
VAre you sure?
p12606
sg4
I3
sa(dp12607
g2
VI have an idea.
p12608
sg4
I4
sa(dp12609
g2
VIf we come back here, we'll know we've been this way before.
p12610

V(to himself) Little guy with glasses\u2026Huh.
p12612
sg4
I6
sa(dp12613

VHey, I know him. (to Zelenka) Don't shoot. We don't have any weapons.
p12614
sg4
I13
sa(dp12615
g2
VWait a second. What is that?
p12616
sg4
I6
sa(dp12617
g2
VLet me see.
p12618
sg4
I3
sa(dp12619

VI don't know, but something tells me it's important.
p12620

VI don't know.
p12622
sg4
I3
sa(dp12623

p12624
sg4
I6
sa(dp12625
g2
VHuh\u2026
p12626
sg4
I1
sa(dp12627
g2
VWait a minute. Maybe they are the same. That would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat.
p12628
sg4
I20
sa(dp12629
g2
VWell, think about it. I mean, this planet didn't have a Stargate until we came here. Maybe when the Ancients were-were first, uh, scouting this place, they accidentally brought this, uh\u2026uh, Kirsan Fever with them. It got trapped here, and over the course of ten thousand years, it mutated to cause the symptoms we're now experiencing.
p12630
sg4
I56
sa(dp12631
g2
VOkay, this is pointless. Look, we don't even know if he still has a radio. And even if we find him, chances are, he's not gonna remember what he did with the control crystal. Let's face it, we're screwed.
p12632
sg4
I39
sa(dp12633
g2
VThat doesn't matter. Without the control crystal, the 'Gate can't establish a stable wormhole. We're not going anywhere.
p12634
sg4
I18
sa(dp12635
g2
V(sighing) I'll figure something out.
p12636
sg4
I5
sa(dp12637
g2
VOh\u2026wait a second. What am I doing?
p12638
sg4
I7
sa(dp12639
g2
VRight. Right. Okay, that's easy. It's just a simple matter of accessing the root directory and\u2026 (he presses a few buttons, and the computer beeps an alarm) Aw, come on!
p12640
sg4
I30
sa(dp12641
g2
VNo, no, no, no. I should be able to do this in my sleep. Oh god\u2026it's happening to me too, isn't it?
p12642
sg4
I22
sa(dp12643
g2
VOh, no, no, no. You don't understand. My memory was lousy to start with. I mean, people's names, birthdays\u2026I once forgot mother's day five years in a row.
p12644
sg4
I28
sa(dp12645
g2
VWell, that-that's pi. 3.14159265, etc., etc. But that doesn't count, that's easy.
p12646
sg4
I12
sa(dp12647

VRight. Right, so\u2026 Wait a minute, doesn't that make me a really bad person?
p12648

I14

g2
VOh, okay.
p12650

p12654
sg4

p12694
sg4

g2
VOkay, so\u2026Cliff Robertson?
p12698
sg4
I3

VVery good. Shelley Winters.
p12702

V(chuckling) Oh, give me a break.
p12724
sg4
I6
sa(dp12725
g2
VWell, gee, let me think. Um\u2026no. Look, in a-in a mechanical, Newtonian universe? Not a problem. I mean, you know enough variables, you can predict the outcome. But, uh, quantum physics blows that out of the water.
p12726
sg4
I37
sa(dp12727

VI-I think I just saw a vision.
p12740

VOf us. Being captured by the Wraith.
p12742

sa(dp12743

VThat's what I saw, yes.
p12744
sg4
I5
sa(dp12745

VWhat?
p12746
sg4
I1
sa(dp12747
g2
VThis is a bad idea.
p12748
sg4
I5
sa(dp12749
g2
VYeah, I was thinking about that. I realized that quantum uncertainty doesn't necessarily preclude of, uh, seeing probable futures. It's like blackjack. You never know exactly what's gonna happen next, but, uh, a card counter can certainly increase the odds in his favor. And frankly, this feels like hitting on an eighteen.
p12750
sg4
I52
sa(dp12751
g2
VHold on. This is the place. This is where it happened!
p12752
sg4
I11
sa(dp12753
g2
VMmm. M5S-768. We visited it last year. It was a thriving pre-industrial society.
p12754

I13
sa(dp12755
g2
VOkay.
p12756

sa(dp12757

VReceiving MALP telemetry. Here we go.
p12758

sa(dp12759

VNo life signs.
p12760

sa(dp12761

VThe MALP's detecting residual radiation. The energy signature's consistent with Replicator weapons fire. He's telling the truth.
p12762
sg4
I17
sa(dp12763
g2
VWe estimated somewhere between fifty and seventy-five thousand.
p12764
sg4
I8
sa(dp12765
g2
VIf we hadn't deactivated the attack code, this never would've happened.
p12766
sg4
I11
sa(dp12767
g2
VBut it was my idea. We had a ZPM, we had Elizabeth. All we had to do was leave. But I opened my big mouth.
p12768
sg4
I25
sa(dp12769
g2
VNo, we don't know that for sure. Look, remember the nanovirus that caused the fatal aneurysms? I always suspected the Replicators were behind it.
p12770
sg4
I24
sa(dp12771
g2
VYeah, but we know how they feel about the humans. They think we were a mistake. Look, we should've seen something like this coming.
p12772
sg4
I24
sa(dp12773
g2
VI suppose the most obvious solution is to shut down the attack code again.
p12774
sg4
I14
sa(dp12775
g2
VIt's been done before, just\u2026not by us.
p12776
sg4
I7
sa(dp12777
g2
VYes.
p12778
sg4
I1
sa(dp12779
g2
VWell, he claims to have the original virus that deactivated the attack code the first time. It's not working this time round because of the changes we made in the Replicator base code. Theoretically, knowing what we know and knowing what they know, we should be able to work together to shut them down again.
p12780
sg4
I55
sa(dp12781
g2
VI've been looking into that, and it's not very promising.
p12782
sg4
I10
sa(dp12783
g2
VWell, that was easy. Well, actually, it was spectacularly difficult, but then, everything's relative.
p12784
sg4
I14
sa(dp12785
g2
VLook, the Replicators were originally designed and programmed to do exactly what they're doing. I mean, they were built for this. It was much harder for the Wraith to get them to stop then it was for me to get them to start again.
p12786
sg4
I44
sa(dp12787
g2
VIf he really has the original shut-down virus, yeah, I think we can.
p12788

p12806

sa(dp12807

VHe's holding out on us! Part of the virus is missing. I mean, sure they're minor subroutines, nothing that would be greatly affected by the changes I made to the Replicator base code, but still\u2026necessary to make it work! Look, I probably wouldn't have even noticed it, except\u2026well, you know, I'm really good. Look, he's definitely up to something!

p12812

I12

g2
V(snapping his fingers) That's it. That's why they're coming. They're tracking his ship. Think about it. A single hive, off by itself out in the middle of nowhere orbiting a supposedly uninhabited planet. That's bound to raise a few eyebrows. I mean\u2026if you had eyebrows.

p12886

I17
sa(dp12887
g2
VWell, before Sheppard's Wraith showed up, I was trying to perfect my nanite medical program.
p12888
sg4
I15
sa(dp12889
g2
VYeah, a better, more complex version of that, but yeah. Of course, as soon as we found out that the Replicators were attacking human worlds throughout the galaxy, we obviously switched our focus to shutting them down once and for all.
p12890
sg4
I41
sa(dp12891
g2
VYeah. I just-I needed a new set of eyes.
p12892
sg4
I9
sa(dp12893
g2
VYeah. Well, maybe the Trust or some other Earth-based organization wanted info on me or about the Program. But regardless, my e-mail and her capture happened too close together not to be connected.

p12896

p12898

p12900

I28
sa(dp12901

p12918

p12934

I10
sa(dp12935

VBonus? Look, I have no idea who you are, but you have made a terrible mistake bringing me here. Now, I suggest you let us both go right now, otherwise about a hundred marines are going to come kicking down your front door in the next two minutes.

p12944
sg4
I18
sa(dp12945

p12954

VI don't even know what all that means. How am I supposed to help?
p12956

p12984

sg4
I34
sa(dp12991

VOh, you think. All right, let's just for a second imagine that we live in this magical land of unicorns and wizards and kind-hearted people who you can take at their word. Let's assume that he lets us go if we save her. But what if we fail, huh? What if she dies? How happy do you think he'll be then? You think he'll just let us waltz out the door with an "aw shucks, well better luck next time, tiger" attitude, huh?
p12992

p13038

I35
sa(dp13039

p13040

sa(dp13041

p13042

p13100

VThat's never been tested in a live subject, and it's only worked sporadically in simulations. Look, I told you, this programming is nowhere near ready to implement.

VDamage they could technically fix.
p13112
sg4
I5
sa(dp13113

VThey don't care about that. Look, they were designed to fix the body of all physical maladies. I mean, preserving a sense of self isn't one of their directives.

p13124

VOkay, I've put Jeanie in a medically induced coma, and I've broken her legs.
p13126
sg4
I14
sa(dp13127
g2
VWell, we need to slow down the nanites. Look, this could buy us ten hours, at least.
p13128
sg4
I17
sa(dp13129
g2
VShe needed an immediate and severe trauma. Besides, if we shut them down before she's properly healed, all she has is a few broken bones.
p13130
sg4
I25
sa(dp13131
g2
VExactly. Now, I'm pretty sure we can't just keep doing this. I mean, sooner or later, the nanites are going to abandon her broken bones and move to her brain, so we need to move fast.
p13132
sg4
I36
sa(dp13133
g2
VNo. These nanites were designed specifically to be immune to EM field fluctuations.
p13134
sg4
I13
sa(dp13135
g2
VRight.
p13136
sg4
I1

p13138

g2
VYeah, well it's the only one I got.
p13140
sg4
I8
sa(dp13141

VLook, you understand the Replicator coding better than anyone. If we're going to do this quickly, then\u2026we need your help. (struck with the sudden reversed position) And why should you care? I mean, we're going to kill you either way, right? That's what you're thinking? Okay, okay, um, so\u2026incentives. Uh, first off, we have no interest in killing you. Of course, you've probably already figured that out by now. But we can't let you go either because you know too much about Atlantis, unless you could prove that you were trustworthy. And\u2026this would go a long way towards proving that.
p13142
sg4
I100
sa(dp13143
g2
VRight. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't buy that either. Heh. Do you have any relatives? Do the Wraith have brothers or sisters? I-I don't know how it works. But with us, with\u2026my people? Those bonds mean a lot. My sister's in trouble, and it's pretty much all my fault. You could help us. You-you could save her.
p13144
sg4
I58
sa(dp13145
g2
VDoesn't mean anything to you, does it? I suppose it wouldn't mean much to me either if I was in your place. Okay, okay, you and I both know that if we can figure out how to shut down these Earth-made nanites, it would be a giant step towards shutting down the Replicators. I know you lost your hive. I have no idea how horrible that must have been for you.
p13146
sg4
I71
sa(dp13147
g2
VBut knowing that they're still out there? That-that you alone could do something about it? That's gotta be driving you crazy. So don't do this for me. Don't-don't do this for my sister. Do this for yourself. Do this because you know you can, and because you know it'll help destroy the Replicators once and for all. Whaddya say?

I59
sa(dp13149
g2
VThank you.
p13150

I2
sa(dp13157
g2
VNo, I believe him. He can't finish the coding without feeding. I understand exactly what he's doing, but he's far more versed in implementing it than I am. Maybe if I had a couple of weeks, but he's the only one who can do it in a day.
p13158

g2
VI know. It needs to be me.
p13160

V(scared, but determined) I want him to feed on me.
p13162
sg4

VSharon died. Half an hour ago.
p13166
sg4
I6
sa(dp13167
g2
VThis time, it wasn't a problem with the programming, it was a manufacturing defect. Look, in layman's terms, the nanites ran out of steam while they were repairing her arteries. She bled out internally. There was nothing we could do. I can't lose my sister, John. How am I going to explain that to her husband? To-to her kid?
p13168

g2
VThat's my choice to make.

g2
VLooks like Michael's got his hyperdrive back online. It's powering up.
p13370
sg4
I11
sa(dp13371
g2
VNot from this little thing. Look, the drive room is just down the corridor. You slap a-a C-4 charge on that thing, it should certainly shut it down.

VSo\u2026how you doing?
p13376
sg4
I3
sa(dp13377
g2
VOh yeah. Yeah, I-I had a kidney stone once. Incredibly painful. Same kind of thing from what I'm told, so I-I hear ya. Actually, my cat and I had one at the same time. We were not fun to be around, I'll tell you that much. He got his 'cause he was eating too much of the dry cat food; I got mine 'cause I wasn't drinking enough liquids. That's why you always see my hydrating. I have no desire to experience that kind of pain again. Oh, it's just\u2014
p13378

VYeah, it's no problem.

p13386
sg4
I12

VYou just hang on. We'll get you back to the infirmary on the Daedalus, and Keller can pull it\u2026out.

p13398
sg4
I10
sa(dp13399

VYeah, but before doctors, the infant mortality rate was incredibly high. It was only like one in three, I think! Look, a doctor is a very important part of this process. Trust me\u2014

p13406
sg4
I14
sa(dp13407
g2
VOkay, I can do this. All right, look, I may have-I may have panicked a little back there, but we're gonna do this. We're gonna do this. I am great with kids\u2014the little ones, the ones that don't talk back.

VHe's a boy.
p13414
sg4

p13416
sg4
I24
sa(dp13417
g2
VYeah, okay, so\u2026okay. Teyla, I'd like to introduce you to your son.
p13418
sg4
I12
sa(dp13419
g2
V(delighted) I caught it. It didn't hit the floor or anything.
p13420

VYes.

VI just delivered a baby! That's not enough for today?
p13430
sg4
I10
sa(dp13431
g2
VNo, they\u2014they\u2014 Wait, I know. I need to get back to a data terminal. A lot of their internal power's down. Maybe I can short out their jamming code. We can get the Daedalus to beam us out.
p13432

I38
sa(dp13433
g2
VHey, what's with the bags?
p13434
sg4
I5
sa(dp13435

VGoing to see Teyla. Oh, you probably heard. I delivered her baby.
p13436

VYes! Really?
p13438

I2
sa(dp13443
g2
VOkay\u2026?
p13444
sg4
I1
sa(dp13445
g2
VAre you crazy? They probably want to give you a medal. You had a great year. I know my opinion doesn't mean much to those folks, but, um\u2026I think you've done an excellent job. I'm glad you took the post.
p13446
sg4
I40
sa(dp13447
g2
VSure. See you soon.
p13448
sg4
I4
sa(dp13449
g2
V(petulant) I don't know what all the fuss is about. If we do this every time someone comes for a visit, we'd never get any work done.
p13450
sg4
I27
sa(dp13451
g2
VWe're not just meeting him at the 'gate! I've been pulled from my regular duties to help him with his "database research." I've got stuff on the go, you know\u2014important, vital projects for the-the betterment of the human race.
p13452

I39
sa(dp13453
g2
V(grumbling) Yeah.
p13454
sg4
I2
sa(dp13455

V(unenthusiastic) Oh, sure, sure. Whaddya got planned? An exciting exploration of insignificant Ancient historical events?
p13456
sg4
I15
sa(dp13457
g2
VYeah, and I've been over all of his logs. Look, this is work we've done already.
p13458
sg4
I16
sa(dp13459
g2
V(dubious) Secret lab?
p13460
sg4
I3
sa(dp13461
g2
VI've been over Janus's database entries with a fine-toothed comb. I never saw any mention of a secret lab.
p13462
sg4
I19
sa(dp13463
g2
VJust get to the point.
p13464
sg4
I5
sa(dp13465
g2
VHe had lovers?
p13466
sg4
I3
sa(dp13467
g2
VWell, that could just mean he was hard to talk to! People say things like that about me all the time!
p13468
sg4
I21
sa(dp13469
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh! "Today, I saw Janus in the hallway." There's a real page turner.
p13470
sg4
I14
sa(dp13471
g2
V(intrigued) Well, did this assistant happen to mention\u2026
p13472
sg4
I8
sa(dp13473
g2
VHmm. Well\u2026
p13474
sg4
I2
sa(dp13475
g2
VHmm.
p13476
sg4
I1
sa(dp13477
g2
V(absently) Good luck. (stopping short) What do you mean "us"?
p13478
sg4
I10
sa(dp13479
g2
VYeah, this section of the city flooded the first year we were here. Anything salvageable got moved to the main tower.
p13480
sg4
I21
sa(dp13481
g2
V(excited) Ooh, like the Batcave!
p13482
sg4
I5
sa(dp13483
g2
VWell, I'm not picking up anything unusual\u2026
p13484
sg4
I7
sa(dp13485
g2
VHmph. And here.
p13486
sg4
I3
sa(dp13487
g2
V(unimpressed) Looks like a run-of-the-mill sconce interface.
p13488
sg4
I7
sa(dp13489
g2
VI don't know. Maybe the decorator changed his mind.
p13490
sg4
I9
sa(dp13491
g2
VDid we keep detailed records? Who are you talking to here?
p13492
sg4
I11
sa(dp13493
g2
VThere. There are your light fixtures.
p13494
sg4
I6
sa(dp13495
g2
VPossibly.
p13496
sg4
I1
sa(dp13497

VThey're lights that fell to the ground during a flood. It's not like they're gonna\u2014
p13498

sa(dp13499
g2
V(sighing) All right.
p13500
sg4
I3
sa(dp13501
g2
VHere they are. I've got 'em.
p13502
sg4
I6
sa(dp13503
g2
V(slowly) Not usually, no.
p13504
sg4
I4
sa(dp13505
g2
VWell, they've been banged around a lot, underwater for a few days. Maybe they're just broken.
p13506
sg4
I16
sa(dp13507
g2
V(scoffing) What, you mean like a three digit code? You know how easy that would be to break? There's only six variations.
p13508
sg4
I22
sa(dp13509
g2
V(sarcastic) What, you mean like, does it remind me of Janus's favorite Brian Eno track? No. No such luck.
p13510
sg4
I19
sa(dp13511
g2
VGo for it.
p13512
sg4
I3
sa(dp13513
g2
VHold on for a second.
p13514
sg4
I5
sa(dp13515
g2
VCome here and push against this wall.
p13516
sg4
I7
sa(dp13517
g2
VPlease, just\u2026humor me. I think I'm onto something.
p13518
sg4
I8
sa(dp13519
g2
VOkay, on the count of three, I want you to push against the wall as hard as you can, okay?
p13520
sg4
I20
sa(dp13521
g2
VOkay, one\u2026two\u2026three.
p13522
sg4
I2
sa(dp13523
g2
VSon of a bitch.
p13524
sg4
I4
sa(dp13525
g2
VControlled magnetic harmonic resonance.
p13526
sg4
I4
sa(dp13527
g2
VApparently Tesla was close to something like this before Edison trashed his lab.
p13528
sg4
I13
sa(dp13529
g2
VThat wall was specially designed to destabilize when bombarded with a very specific harmonic resonance. That's what the tones were! And the strong magnetic property of the particles is what keeps the door from just crumbling into dust. It's a great way to hide a door, because, you know, if you're looking for a door to open, it's never going to be found. It's like a hologram, only better because it-it's solid mass until the tones are playing.
p13530
sg4
I78
sa(dp13531
g2
VI could have, yes.
p13532
sg4
I4
sa(dp13533
g2
V(excited) Janus's secret lab!
p13534
sg4
I4
sa(dp13535
g2
VHarmonic resonance.
p13536
sg4
I2
sa(dp13537
g2
VWell, the wall would break apart your body.
p13538
sg4
I8
sa(dp13539
g2
VI've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside. The wall is now permanently open. Don't worry.
p13540
sg4
I16
sa(dp13541
g2
VThere are levels of encryption on all of the data here that even the most paranoid NSA agent wouldn't use. I mean, it is deep.
p13542
sg4
I25
sa(dp13543
g2
VAnd until we start deciphering, there's no way to tell what any of this stuff does.
p13544
sg4
I16
sa(dp13545
g2
V(noncommittally) Mmm.
p13546
sg4
I2
sa(dp13547
g2
VHow's that going?
p13548
sg4
I3
sa(dp13549
g2
VWell, you're more than welcome to help us crack this first stream cipher. (to Daniel) You know, um, he could've been in Mensa.
p13550
sg4
I23
sa(dp13551
g2
VWill do.
p13552
sg4
I2
sa(dp13553
g2
VWhat? No, no, no. I'm fine. Fine. But, you know, if you need to rest, I'll completely understand.
p13554
sg4
I18
sa(dp13555
g2
VI'm not sure what you're talking about.
p13556
sg4
I7
sa(dp13557
g2
VOkay, I will admit that I may have been a little brusque with you up until now.
p13558
sg4
I17
sa(dp13559
g2
VBut the truth is, I really didn't think you were going to find anything!
p13560
sg4
I14
sa(dp13561
g2
VYou do?
p13562
sg4
I2
sa(dp13563
g2
VDoesn't that bother you? I mean, no vindication, no recognition, no\u2026credit?
p13564
sg4
I11
sa(dp13565
g2
V(relaxing) Too true. So, I guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?
p13566
sg4
I15
sa(dp13567
g2
VGood one. (sobering) Wait a minute\u2014you don't get paid more than I do, do you?
p13568
sg4
I15
sa(dp13569
g2
VDo you?
p13570
sg4
I2
sa(dp13571
g2
V(into radio, unconcerned) What's up?
p13572
sg4
I5
sa(dp13573
g2
V(into radio, worried) Why?
p13574
sg4
I4
sa(dp13575
g2
VOh. Ow. What the hell happened?
p13576
sg4
I6
sa(dp13577
g2
VThat much I got. Thanks. By who?
p13578
sg4
I7
sa(dp13579
g2
VOkay, there is no way this is a coincidence. I mean, we discover Janus's super-secret lab, and less than twenty-four hours later, a bunch of aliens show up all guns blazing? Don't you think that's a little odd?
p13580
sg4
I38
sa(dp13581
g2
VA subspace signal. It's the only possible answer.
p13582
sg4
I8
sa(dp13583
g2
VWe've come across them before. They're a-a real-time practically instantaneous link between two Ancient devices. They can be separated by like, half a galaxy.
p13584
sg4
I24
sa(dp13585
g2
VSo they're standing around, they're scratching their heads, they have no idea what's going on. Then they discover the subspace link.
p13586
sg4
I21
sa(dp13587
g2
VWell, we-we gotta get out of here.
p13588
sg4
I7
sa(dp13589
g2
VI'll think of something.
p13590
sg4
I4
sa(dp13591
g2
VYep. Always do.
p13592
sg4
I3
sa(dp13593
g2
VOw!
p13594
sg4
I1
sa(dp13595
g2
V(annoyed) You could have told me that before I touched it!
p13596
sg4
I11
sa(dp13597
g2
VWe've got one thing going for us at least.
p13598
sg4
I9
sa(dp13599
g2
VWe're not dead yet.
p13600
sg4
I4
sa(dp13601
g2
V(whimpering in pain) Oh. Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.
p13602
sg4
I8
sa(dp13603
g2
VWe don't even know what it is!
p13604
sg4
I7
sa(dp13605
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh, great. It's sealed shut, and they've removed the door control from this side.
p13606
sg4
I15
sa(dp13607
g2
VI'd say judging by the Lantian architecture, I'd guess, you know, secret Janus facility? Which is, you know, probably bad for us, because it probably means it's hard to find.
p13608
sg4
I30
sa(dp13609
g2
VDoes that look familiar to you?
p13610
sg4
I6
sa(dp13611
g2
VAt least we know why they brought us with them.
p13612
sg4
I10
sa(dp13613
g2
VRight. And I don't get think we're gonna get any more info from Talky McSays-a-Lot out there, so, uh, fire up these consoles. See what we're dealing with.
p13614
sg4
I28
sa(dp13615
g2
V(abruptly) Not like that.
p13616
sg4
I4
sa(dp13617
g2
VUm\u2026let's see. Yeah. Like that.
p13618
sg4
I5
sa(dp13619
g2
VAnd then I need to be right there. Yeah.
p13620
sg4
I9
sa(dp13621
g2
V(half to himself) You'd need a lot of power\u2026
p13622
sg4
I9
sa(dp13623
g2
VI think I know what this thing does.
p13624
sg4
I8
sa(dp13625
g2
VIt's an endgame machine.
p13626
sg4
I4
sa(dp13627
g2
VIf it works the way I think it does, it would mean the end of the Wraith once and for all!
p13628
sg4
I21
sa(dp13629
g2
VWell, I never said "destroy", I mean\u2026it would lead to that, I suppose. But\u2026this device would stop them dead in their tracks.
p13630
sg4
I22
sa(dp13631
g2
VIt creates a very specific subspace static. Uh, turbulence is probably a better way of looking at it.
p13632
sg4
I18
sa(dp13633
g2
VOkay, look. Um, although they're all based on a fairly similar technological premise, each race has a slightly different type of hyperdrive. Ours are based on the Asgard drives with their own little twist. The Ancients had their own particular system. And the Wraith, again, have their own separate hyperdrive technology.
p13634
sg4
I51
sa(dp13635
g2
VOkay, so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances by entering and exiting subspace.
p13636
sg4
I19
sa(dp13637
g2
VOkay, so if this machine is capable of actually functioning safely, it disrupts the very specific subspace frequencies the Wraith use.
p13638
sg4
I21
sa(dp13639
g2
VWell that's the genius. They would be able to engage their hyperdrive. It's just that their particular channel of subspace would be destabilized, and the ship would be ripped into a million pieces.
p13640
sg4
I33
sa(dp13641
g2
VYeah.
p13642
sg4
I1
sa(dp13643
g2
VYeah. I mean, because, even if word got back to the other Wraith that the ships should stop using their hyperdrives, they'd be stuck where they were. They'd only be able to travel using sub-light engines.
p13644
sg4
I36
sa(dp13645
g2
VYeah, or just\u2026leave them to die in the vastness of space.
p13646
sg4
I11
sa(dp13647
g2
VAh, well, the catch is that Janus ran a three-day test about\u2026ten thousand years ago and then, shut the whole project down because of "unforeseen side effects."
p13648
sg4
I27
sa(dp13649
g2
VWell, it-it's not clear. But, that's the key to the whole shebang.
p13650
sg4
I12
sa(dp13651
g2
VI mean, Janus brought that back with him to Atlantis but kept it connected to the main system here. One won't work without the other.
p13652
sg4
I25
sa(dp13653
g2
VThat's because we probably can. I mean, we have everything we need here. The question is, whether we should. The last time I went down this road, I\u2026I kinda destroyed a solar system.
p13654
sg4
I33
sa(dp13655
g2
VSo, what do we do?
p13656
sg4
I5
sa(dp13657
g2
V(deflating) Oh.
p13658
sg4
I2
sa(dp13659
g2
V(meekly) I understand, yes.
p13660
sg4
I4
sa(dp13661
g2
V(sarcastic) Great plan, Danny! Great plan!
p13662
sg4
I6
sa(dp13663
g2
VHuh?
p13664
sg4
I1
sa(dp13665
g2
V(impatient) Maybe we should just add it to the list of things that have nothing to do with the task at hand.
p13666
sg4
I22
sa(dp13667
g2
V(petulant) Well, you work on understanding them, I'll work on trying not to get us killed.
p13668

p13672
sg4
I8
sa(dp13673
g2
VWell, it wasn't broken! He just shut it down. All you need is that,(points to device) \u2026a basic understanding of Janus's coding style, and, uh, here's where I come in again, the Ancient gene. I mean, we're-we're ready to roll.
p13674
sg4
I40
sa(dp13675
g2
VWhat?
p13676
sg4
I1
sa(dp13677
g2
VThey're going to kill you! We don't have a choice.
p13678
sg4
I10
sa(dp13679
g2
VOkay, so I do nothing, they come in here, they kill you. Who gets killed next, huh? Me. To tell you the truth here, I'm quite fond of me. So we might as well do it, you know, now, while you're still alive as opposed to as opposed to, you know, then.
p13680
sg4
I52
sa(dp13681
g2
VAll right.
p13682

p13686

I6
sa(dp13687

VIt's operational.
p13688
sg4
I2
sa(dp13689
g2
V(chuckling, pleased) No. Everything's in the green. I mean, it's working great.
p13690
sg4
I12
sa(dp13691
g2
VThey're still unforeseen. For now, it's working, and we're still alive.
p13692
sg4
I11
sa(dp13693
g2
V(hopefully) Uh, maybe, uh, a nice pat on the back, and an all-expense paid trip back to Atlantis?
p13694
sg4
I18
sa(dp13695
g2
V(deflating) Mmm.
p13696
sg4
I2
sa(dp13697
g2
VOh boy\u2026
p13698
sg4
I2
sa(dp13699
g2
VI think I just found a log entry that tells us what the side effect is.
p13700
sg4
I16
sa(dp13701
g2
VNo. No, no, no. You and I are safe. It's the rest of the galaxy that's gonna have problems, including\u2026Atlantis. I've got to shut this thing down.
p13702
sg4
I27
sa(dp13703
g2
VAll right, so the device creates a very specific subspace "turbulence" that makes it impossible for the Wraith to operate their hyperdrives.
p13704
sg4
I22
sa(dp13705
g2
VBut there's a side-effect.
p13706
sg4
I4
sa(dp13707
g2
VYeah, well, it's certainly not "seen" here, because there's no Stargate on this planet.
p13708
sg4
I14
sa(dp13709
g2
VLook, although the subspace turbulence only affects the Wraith's hyperdrive systems, it creates a very dangerous type of radiation that, uh, well\u2026that messes with the basic operation of the Stargates.
p13710
sg4
I30
sa(dp13711
g2
VWell, all of the Stargates in the Pegasus network, yes.
p13712
sg4
I10
sa(dp13713
g2
VLook, when dialed, power will build up inside the 'gate until it overloads.
p13714
sg4
I13
sa(dp13715
g2
VIt'll explode. I mean, millions of people will die if we don't shut that thing down.
p13716
sg4
I16
sa(dp13717
g2
VWhoa! We'll both go! No need for that.
p13718
sg4
I8
sa(dp13719
g2
V(weakly) Well\u2026I guess it\u2026just must be your turn to use the fitness room.
p13720

I13
sa(dp13721
g2
V(worried) Good luck.
p13722
sg4

sa(dp13723
g2
V(stunned) You okay? I thought you were a goner!
p13724
sg4
I9
sa(dp13725
g2
VI mean, they need me. You're kinda expendable. I just figured that\u2014
p13726
sg4
I12
sa(dp13727
g2
VWell, what did they want?
p13728
sg4
I5
sa(dp13729
g2
VOh. How'd that go?
p13730
sg4
I4
sa(dp13731
g2
V(stunned) For real?
p13732
sg4
I3
sa(dp13733
g2
VI did not see that one coming.
p13734
sg4
I7
sa(dp13735
g2
VOkay, are they going to shut off the device?
p13736
sg4
I9
sa(dp13737
g2
VThen I don't care. I mean, as long as that thing is on, then millions of people could die. Besides, I think I've figured a way out of here.
p13738
sg4
I29
sa(dp13739
g2
VThis is an Ancient facility, and Rodney McKay knows a thing or two about Ancient facilities.
p13740
sg4
I16
sa(dp13741
g2
VEh, mentally unstable like a fox! Okay, so here's the plan. I blow the fire-monitoring fuse. The system suddenly goes dead. It assumes there could be a fire, detects life signs inside the room, it unlocks the doors for safety.
p13742
sg4
I40
sa(dp13743
g2
VAnd\u2026ach!
p13744
sg4
I1
sa(dp13745
g2
V(pleased) Huh. It's a good thing they brought you back when they did, because, you know, I just assumed you were dead, and I was going to leave.
p13746
sg4
I28
sa(dp13747
g2
VYeah. You're welcome.
p13748
sg4
I3
sa(dp13749

VWe've got to shut down the device.
p13750
sg4
I7
sa(dp13751
g2
V(stammering) We'll just\u2026we'll improvise.
p13752
sg4
I4
sa(dp13753
g2
VOkay, we need to get the device control room.
p13754
sg4
I9
sa(dp13755
g2
VWell, then, we need to create a diversion.
p13756
sg4
I8
sa(dp13757
g2
VOkay, uh, we go to the, uh, power relay station; we create a massive explosion.
p13758
sg4
I15
sa(dp13759
g2
VWhat?
p13760
sg4
I1
sa(dp13761
g2
VYes.
p13762
sg4
I1
sa(dp13763
g2
VWell, I would.
p13764
sg4
I3
sa(dp13765
g2
VOh, I'm sorry. You know, I'm a good person. I would want to save people from the fire, maybe figure out what was going on?
p13766
sg4
I25
sa(dp13767
g2
VExplosion diversions are the very cornerstones of diversions.
p13768

g2
VOh my god, please don't kill me. You need me!
p13772
sg4
I10
sa(dp13773
g2
VUs, us. You need us. Look, the device needs constant care. I mean, uh, true, I'm the only one that knows how to work it, but uh\u2026what am I talking about killing for? You're not a violent race. I mean, you-you may have stunned us\u2026
p13774
sg4
I45
sa(dp13775
g2
V(continuing) \u2026more than we would've liked. But who's to say we didn't deserve it, right?
p13776
sg4
I15
sa(dp13777
g2
VYes, suits\u2014suits that house one of the smartest races that ever evolved! I mean, the Asgard! I've always been a big fan of the Asgards. Some of my best friends are Asgards\u2014
p13778
sg4
I32
sa(dp13779
g2
V(abashed) Yeah. I know. I was, uh\u2026
p13780

VAll right, you look watch the\u2026aw, come on!
p13788
sg4
I8
sa(dp13789
g2
VWell, something must have spooked them.
p13790
sg4
I6
sa(dp13791
g2
VWell, aside from encrypting access to this workstation\u2026?
p13792
sg4
I8
sa(dp13793
g2
VYeah, in a heartbeat. But as they very well know, you can't operate this machine without the control key. Look, the thing they stole from Janus's lab to begin with\u2026
p13794
sg4
I30
sa(dp13795
g2
VWe can't do much more than turn the lights off and on without the component thing.
p13796
sg4
I16
sa(dp13797
g2
V(inspired) Wait a second\u2026these suits were designed to protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?
p13798
sg4
I15
sa(dp13799
g2
VThen I have a really terrible idea.
p13800
sg4
I7
sa(dp13801
g2
VNot to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly, but\u2026Yeah, the antenna has a control crystal. If we can pull it manually\u2026
p13802
sg4
I22
sa(dp13803
g2
VI'd go thirty-seventy. But I don't have a better idea, and the suits\u2026they should protect us.
p13804
sg4
I16
sa(dp13805
g2
VYou ready?
p13806
sg4
I2
sa(dp13807

VYou know, we both don't have to go in there.
p13808

g2
V(drily) Oh. Great pep talk. Thanks.
p13810
sg4
I6
sa(dp13811
g2
VI'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.
p13812
sg4
I10
sa(dp13813
g2
VI have to pull the right one, or the antenna explodes.
p13814
sg4
I11

p13822

V(forlorn) I'm-I'm pretty sure we're on our own.
p13824
sg4
I8
sa(dp13825
g2
VLook, I mean, on the bright side, I mean, we're both gonna be dead of dehydration in like, five days, so you won't have to put up with me for much longer.
p13826
sg4
I32
sa(dp13827

p13832

VWell, you know me. It's function over fashion.
p13834
sg4
I8

VNot without this. It's the facility's main control crystal.
p13836

VOne step ahead of you. It's not going to happen again.
p13848

p13850

VWell, let's\u2026hope not.
p13852
sg4
I3

VYeah, I heard. They're, um, sending you back to Earth.
p13854
sg4
I10
sa(dp13855
g2
VWell, the Daedalus has already picked up a 'gate, uh, leftover from the old Gate Bridge, and, uh, my team is installing it as we speak, so we should have you home in, uh, no time at all.
p13856

g2
VYes. So\u2026
p13858

p13860

g2
V(affronted) Excuse me? I said no such thing.
p13862

sa(dp13863
g2
VI don't believe I ever finished that sentence.
p13864
sg4
I8
sa(dp13865

V(stammering) I would've said "regret." I would've said "I really regret you being here because none of this would've happened\u2026otherwise."
p13866

g2
VSurvivors of the Hoffan plague? Here?
p13874
sg4
I6
sa(dp13875

VWell, the Wraith aren't too pleased to have whole populations out there that are immune to their feeding.
p13876

VThe one what?
p13878
sg4

p13880
sg4
I1
sa(dp13881

p13882

p13884

p13888

I5
sa(dp13889
g2
VWe are?
p13890
sg4
I2
sa(dp13891
g2
VAs soon as we take the 'gate, we should call in some jumpers. It'll make evacuating the village a lot faster.
p13892
sg4
I21
sa(dp13893
g2
VOh, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
p13894
sg4
I8

p13896
sg4
I5
sa(dp13897
g2
VSo what now?
p13898
sg4
I3
sa(dp13899

VWait a minute. What about the mine? These tracks lead right down to it. I mean, we just follow them.
p13900

sa(dp13901
g2
VExactly.
p13902
sg4

p13908
sg4
I26
sa(dp13909
g2
VAll right, uh, just don't\u2014don't panic. Don't panic. I have\u2026got lots of experience escaping from these things.
p13910
sg4
I17
sa(dp13911
g2
VOh, yeah. Yeah. I've been in this situation dozens of times. Always figured a way out.
p13912
sg4
I16
sa(dp13913

VUh, let's see, uh\u2026Last time, uh, Teyla was posing as a queen, so, um\u2026You know, she\u2026had us released.
p13914

g2
V(weakly) First time for everything, right?
p13920
sg4
I6
sa(dp13921

p13922

p13924
sg4
I4

V(smugly) Guess that didn't work out so well.
p13926

p13928
sg4
I8

p13930

I28

g2
VWhat do you mean? You don't\u2026understand it?
p13932
sg4
I7
sa(dp13933
g2
VWhat's the alternative, huh? We know the Wraith aren't going to just let the matter drop. We've seen what they can do. They'll-they'll-they'll wipe out entire villages just to get a few like the Balarans.
p13934
sg4
I35
sa(dp13935
g2
VI mean, you just\u2026stall! You know, you make it look like you're working until\u2026we figure out how to get the hell out of here.
p13936
sg4
I24
sa(dp13937
g2
VHey, I never said it was going to be easy, okay? But you can't solve all of the galaxy's problems in one day! Look, I understand. You feel guilty. But this is not your fault. You had no idea that any of this was going to happen.
p13938

p13968

V(conceding) Beckett helped.

sa(dp13987

VYou?! Look, we're the ones stuck on the ship!
p13988
sg4
I9
sa(dp13989
g2
VWhat?!
p13990
sg4
I1
sa(dp13991
g2
VLook, it is bad enough that I hacked into communications. If I start messing around with other systems, they're gonna\u2014they're gonna track us down in, like, a matter of minutes.
p13992
sg4
I30
sa(dp13993
g2
V(sighing) All right. I'll see what I can do. Give me a few minutes. That should be enough time.
p13994
sg4
I19
sa(dp13995
g2
VYeah, yeah, yeah. Just don't forget about us, okay?
p13996
sg4
I9
sa(dp13997
g2
VDo I rush you while you're performing complicated surgery?
p13998
sg4
I9
sa(dp13999
g2
VAll right, I'm in. Now, just need a few minutes to disable the\u2014
p14000
sg4
I13
sa(dp14001
g2
VOh, geez! I think they found us.
p14002
sg4
I7
sa(dp14003
g2
VOkay, you're going to have to hold them off.
p14004
sg4
I9
sa(dp14005
g2
VYeah, come on, Carson. You can do this, all right?
p14006
sg4
I10
sa(dp14007
g2
VHow about on one?
p14008
sg4
I4
sa(dp14009
g2
VAlmost there.
p14010
sg4
I2
sa(dp14011
g2
VAll right, that's it! I got it! Let's go!
p14012
sg4
I9
sa(dp14013
g2
VThe dart bay.
p14014
sg4
I3
sa(dp14015
g2
VWell, I've flown jumpers before.
p14016
sg4
I5
sa(dp14017
g2
VWell, how hard can it be?
p14018
sg4
I6
sa(dp14019
g2
VYeah, I pulled up a schematic of the ship on that console.
p14020
sg4
I12
sa(dp14021
g2
VAll right, that's sealed.
p14022
sg4
I4
sa(dp14023
g2
VNot very.
p14024
sg4
I2
sa(dp14025
g2
VWell, come on.
p14026
sg4
I3
sa(dp14027
g2
V(incredulous) What are you doing?!
p14028
sg4
I5
sa(dp14029
g2
VWell, we can't both fit in here!
p14030
sg4
I7
sa(dp14031
g2
V(sarcastic) You comfy?
p14032
sg4
I3
sa(dp14033
g2
V(grunting under his breath) All right.
p14034
sg4
I6
sa(dp14035
g2
VWell, it should just start up.
p14036
sg4
I6
sa(dp14037
g2
V(exasperated) Yeah, I know that. But it doesn't make any sense. I mean, a canopy should form over our head. Maybe there's some kind of a weight limit.
p14038
sg4
I28
sa(dp14039
g2
VI mean, because there's two of us!
p14040
sg4
I7
sa(dp14041
g2
VIt's not a Volkswagen, Carson! Okay, look, these are obviously the flight controls. That makes that propulsion, so\u2026
p14042
sg4
I18
sa(dp14043
g2
VIt was just common sense! (he tries to force a control, and growls) Oh, come on!
p14044
sg4
I16
sa(dp14045
g2
VLook, well what do you want from me? It's not like there's labels!
p14046
sg4
I13
sa(dp14047
g2
VOh, not good!
p14048
sg4
I3
sa(dp14049
g2
VI know. I'm thinking.
p14050
sg4
I4
sa(dp14051
g2
VWhere? I mean, we're trapped in here!
p14052
sg4
I7
sa(dp14053
g2
VI have another idea. It's a long shot, but it might work\u2026but you're going to have to get off me.
p14054
sg4
I20
sa(dp14055
g2
VOh my god, it worked!
p14056
sg4
I5
sa(dp14057
g2
V(stammering) I reprogrammed the culling beam to dematerialize us, then to discharge only from that point on. I mean, once the Wraith lost their weapons, I knew it was just a matter of time before they launched the darts.
p14058
sg4
I39
sa(dp14059
g2
VThere you are! I've been calling you!
p14060
sg4
I7
sa(dp14061
g2
VLorne's team just found a suitable planet for the villagers. They're going to move them out this afternoon.
p14062
sg4
I18
sa(dp14063
g2
V(disappointed) Oh. Right. Of course. Um, well\u2026you want to uh\u2026grab some lunch? I mean, we didn't get any chance to socialize this time around, unless you count, you know, running through the halls of the hive ship as\u2026social time.
p14064
sg4
I39
sa(dp14065
g2
VWell, what is it?
p14066
sg4
I4
sa(dp14067
g2
VWell, you don't have do this now! I'll download the data to a drive. You can just, you know, take it with you.
p14068
sg4
I23
sa(dp14069
g2
V(grimacing) Oh.
p14070
sg4
I2
sa(dp14071
g2
V(failing not to sound hurt) Well, I don't care. No, I was just, you know, trying to stop you from whining about never seeing me. All right.
p14072
sg4
I27
sa(dp14073
g2
VWell, I\u2014
p14074
sg4
I2
sa(dp14075
g2
V(stammering) Me? No. I-um, I don't have time for that.
p14076
sg4
I10
sa(dp14077
g2
VIs there any advanced technology in this "coalition"?
p14078
sg4
I8
sa(dp14079
g2
V(drily) The Federation had ships. Look, what do we hope to gain from this? I mean, the only reason these people even know about each other is because they happened to inherit the 'gate system from the Ancients.
p14080
sg4
I38
sa(dp14081
g2
V(skeptical) Against the Wraith?
p14082
sg4
I4
sa(dp14083
g2
V(sarcastic) Wow. They're really, uh, rolling out the red carpet for us, huh?
p14084
sg4
I13
sa(dp14085
g2
VUh, guys? Not good!
p14086
sg4
I4
sa(dp14087
g2
VWhat the hell happened?
p14088
sg4
I4
sa(dp14089
g2
VGreat.
p14090
sg4
I1
sa(dp14091
g2
VIf they had the address, but-but, I mean, short of that, they'd need to search every solar system in the galaxy for a habitable planet, which would take all of like, what, like a million years?
p14092
sg4
I36
sa(dp14093
g2
VI don't suppose there's any chance you could just convince them that we're not guilty. 'Cause we're not, right?
p14094
sg4
I19
sa(dp14095
g2
VAw, come on. There is no way the Pegasus Galaxy would be better off if we'd never come here.
p14096
sg4
I19
sa(dp14097
g2
VLook, you see that? It's a dart firing on one of the hive ships.
p14098
sg4
I14
sa(dp14099
g2
V(stunned) Sheppard.
p14100
sg4
I2
sa(dp14101
g2
VWell, what about the DHD on the planet where we were ambushed? I mean, you could pull the most recent addresses that were dialed from that.
p14102
sg4
I26
sa(dp14103
g2
VAll right, well they had a very clever plan, but we're-we're smarter and better armed. There's got to be a way around this.
p14104
sg4
I23
sa(dp14105
g2
VWell, what is it?
p14106
sg4
I4
sa(dp14107
g2
VWait a minute, we can't go.
p14108
sg4
I6
sa(dp14109
g2
VI mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected, I-I've been going over the Replicators' base code, and I found this.
p14110
sg4
I24
sa(dp14111
g2
V(excited) The Holy Grail. I mean, it's their whole reason for being. It's a command code that directs them to attack the Wraith.
p14112
sg4
I23
sa(dp14113
g2
VWell, that's because it's been deactivated.
p14114
sg4
I6
sa(dp14115
g2
V(drily) Well, I guess we can rule out getting her vote.
p14116
sg4
I11
sa(dp14117
g2
VSo we were right all along; this whole thing is fixed!
p14118
sg4
I11
sa(dp14119
g2
VWhat other choice do we have? I mean, we know we can't win this thing.
p14120
sg4
I15
sa(dp14121
g2
VUm\u2026we need to get out of here.
p14122
sg4
I7
sa(dp14123
g2
VAs much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.
p14124
sg4
I15
sa(dp14125
g2
V(sighing in relief) Oh, thank god.
p14126
sg4
I6
sa(dp14127
g2
V(mocking) Oh, I'm sorry. Too fast for you, buddy boy?
p14128
sg4
I10
sa(dp14129
g2
VScooter? That is a tri-cell lipo pack under my hood, son.
p14130
sg4
I11
sa(dp14131
g2
VHey!
p14132
sg4
I1
sa(dp14133
g2
VOkay, yeah, I will trample you.
p14134
sg4
I6
sa(dp14135
g2
VCome to think of it, what are you doing down here anyway?
p14136
sg4
I12
sa(dp14137
g2
VOoh, he's colicky, huh?
p14138
sg4
I4
sa(dp14139
g2
VOh, don't worry about it. I was a colicky baby too. Just do what my mum did, which is let me cry myself to sleep. I'm no worse for it.
p14140
sg4
I30
sa(dp14141
g2
V(contrite) Yeah, well, you know, we're done here. We're just\u2026you know\u2026finishing up.
p14142
sg4
I12
sa(dp14143
g2
VGood night! Have\u2026a good one!
p14144
sg4
I5
sa(dp14145
g2
V(urging car) Go, go, go, go, go go, go.
p14146
sg4
I9
sa(dp14147
g2
VI must have put too much strain on the motor. Shaft needs a bushing lube.
p14148
sg4
I15
sa(dp14149
g2
VWhat?
p14150
sg4
I1
sa(dp14151
g2
VBeats me. (keying radio) Radek? Come in. Control room, it's Dr. McKay. We just lost power on the East Pier. What's going on?
p14152
sg4
I23
sa(dp14153
g2
V(puzzled) That's strange. Lights are all out all over the city except the control room.
p14154
sg4
I15
sa(dp14155
g2
V(into radio) This is Dr. Rodney McKay calling anyone in the control room. Please respond.
p14156
sg4
I15
sa(dp14157
g2
VEverything's dead. There's no way of knowing what the hell's going on!
p14158
sg4
I12
sa(dp14159
g2
VRadek!
p14160
sg4
I1
sa(dp14161
g2
VWhat, you don't know either?
p14162
sg4
I5
sa(dp14163
g2
VLook, I need you to go to the main power room instead. See if you reboot the system from there.
p14164
sg4
I20
sa(dp14165
g2
VAll right.
p14166
sg4
I2
sa(dp14167
g2
V(over walkie) Yeah, Radek. Go ahead.
p14168
sg4
I6
sa(dp14169
g2
V(breathless from exertion) What about the ZPM?
p14170
sg4
I7
sa(dp14171
g2
VIf that was the case, then they wouldn't have any power up there either.
p14172
sg4
I14
sa(dp14173
g2
VOkay, listen to me. I want you to do exactly the same thing. Initiate a temporary patch using an external power source\u2014one of the auxiliary battery units.
p14174
sg4
I27
sa(dp14175
g2
VDon't worry about that. Just get me enough juice to access the mainframe so we can figure out what the hell is going on up there.
p14176
sg4
I26
sa(dp14177
g2
VI think Level 36?
p14178
sg4
I4
sa(dp14179
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh, great. 35. Perfect. So just another 28 floors to go. And that's just this stairwell. Then we get to Level 63; got to cross over to an ancillary stairwell. Climb another four levels and that's just to access the Gate Room\u2026ooh! You know, see if you can wrestle enough power to the transporters while you're at it.
p14180
sg4
I59
sa(dp14181
g2
V(finally catching up) Hey.
p14182
sg4
I4
sa(dp14183
g2
VYeah. Well, maybe the-the door was already closed when we lost power.
p14184
sg4
I12
sa(dp14185
g2
VWhat, you think someone's infiltrated Atlantis?
p14186
sg4
I6
sa(dp14187
g2
V(into walkie) Talk to me.
p14188
sg4
I5
sa(dp14189
g2
V(into walkie) Well, what about the transporters?
p14190
sg4
I7
sa(dp14191
g2
V(into walkie) Yeah, well, let me know when you've got one online.
p14192
sg4
I12
sa(dp14193
g2
VAll right.
p14194
sg4
I2
sa(dp14195
g2
VNot much. You're right, though. Someone's taken over Atlantis. Hacked into the mainframe. I'm having a hard time accessing several of the critical systems. And the ones I can access, you know, are read-only.
p14196
sg4
I34
sa(dp14197
g2
V(incredulous) Hey, what're you\u2026how'd you get up here so fast?
p14198
sg4
I10
sa(dp14199
g2
VWe've got closed circuit feeds on the control room and the gate room.
p14200
sg4
I13
sa(dp14201
g2
VThey're not critical systems. I should be able to access them if\u2026got it.
p14202
sg4
I13
sa(dp14203
g2
VIt's definitely not Atlantis personnel.
p14204
sg4
I5
sa(dp14205
g2
VYeah, hang on.
p14206
sg4
I3
sa(dp14207
g2
VOh my god.
p14208
sg4
I3
sa(dp14209
g2
VIs that\u2026?
p14210
sg4
I2
sa(dp14211
g2
VHe's the one who stole our jumper, used it to escape from his cruiser before we could destroy it. He's like a\u2026a cockroach. You know, every time you try and step on him, he just skitters away.
p14212
sg4
I37
sa(dp14213
g2
VWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm picking up a serious energy reading up ahead.
p14214
sg4
I14
sa(dp14215
g2
VI don't know, but we should, uh, stop until I do.
p14216
sg4
I11
sa(dp14217
g2
V(ruefully) He's nothing if not annoyingly industrious.
p14218
sg4
I7
sa(dp14219
g2
V(focusing on his hand-held) Well, we disable it.
p14220
sg4
I8
sa(dp14221
g2
VWe\u2026we\u2026that's a good question.
p14222
sg4
I4
sa(dp14223
g2
VI've been examining the energy reading we picked up, and it appears that Michael has somehow managed to modify the Wraith stun-pulse technology and integrate it with the puddle jumper cloaking mechanism.
p14224
sg4
I32
sa(dp14225
g2
V(caustic) No, a "force field" around the control room and the gate room. Look, while it's in place, we're not getting in there.
p14226
sg4
I23
sa(dp14227
g2
VThat's because we haven't figured that part out yet. Look, it-it's going to be very tricky.
p14228
sg4
I16
sa(dp14229
g2
V(annoyed) Okay, enough with the stun bubble.
p14230
sg4
I7
sa(dp14231
g2
V(talking over Zelenka) It's a stupid description for what it is! You know\u2014
p14232
sg4
I13
sa(dp14233
g2
VLook the point is, that if we want to disable the stun\u2026 (McKay stops himself and glares at the smug Zelenka) \u2026the force field, then we first need to disable the power from the puddle jumper.
p14234
sg4
I36
sa(dp14235
g2
V(frustrated) It's not.
p14236
sg4
I3
sa(dp14237
g2
VYeah, it's a great plan. It's just\u2026I'm just not sure I'm entirely clear on how you intend on doing the actual "blowing up."
p14238
sg4
I23
sa(dp14239
g2
V(caustic) Again, I come back to my question of "how?" We have no way of getting to the jumper bay.
p14240
sg4
I20
sa(dp14241
g2
V(stammering) Uh, no-no-no-no. That's a good-good-good plan. Except I-I see one small problem with that plan, which is that um, the thing is, the underwater bay only has a-a couple of jumpers in it.
p14242
sg4
I34
sa(dp14243
g2
VYes, well, the thing is\u2026um\u2026
p14244
sg4
I5
sa(dp14245
g2
V(contrite) It was the next thing on my list.
p14246
sg4
I9
sa(dp14247
g2
VI know, and I was getting to it, I swear.
p14248
sg4
I10
sa(dp14249
g2
VI was busy!
p14250
sg4
I3
sa(dp14251
g2
VWell, why don't I stay here and work on that? I mean, Zelenka can go with you to the jumper bay.
p14252
sg4
I21
sa(dp14253
g2
V(resigned, to Zelenka) Please tell me there's a transporter?
p14254
sg4
I9
sa(dp14255
g2
VIt's like I said. I mean, both the jumpers are toast. This one's got a whole whack of problems starting with zero power.
p14256
sg4
I23
sa(dp14257
g2
VYeah, but not much else. I mean, the drive pods won't extend. There's no drones.
p14258
sg4
I15
sa(dp14259
g2
V(dubious) Okay, you want to harvest parts from both jumpers, cobble together a fix, so one of them will work?
p14260
sg4
I20
sa(dp14261
g2
VDoubtful.
p14262
sg4
I1
sa(dp14263
g2
VIt's a long shot at best!
p14264
sg4
I6
sa(dp14265
g2
V(muttering to self) Great. Just great.
p14266
sg4
I6
sa(dp14267
g2
VOkay, give 'er\u2026
p14268
sg4
I3
sa(dp14269
g2
V(pleased) All right, now we're getting somewhere. I got juice, I got life support, I got\u2026oh come on!
p14270
sg4
I18
sa(dp14271
g2
V(exasperated) It's the weapons won't come online.
p14272
sg4
I7
sa(dp14273
g2
VI don't know!
p14274
sg4
I3
sa(dp14275
g2
V(worried) That's Atlantis's self destruct. Michael's going to blow up the city!
p14276
sg4
I12
sa(dp14277
g2
V(checking his computer) He's set it for ten minutes.
p14278
sg4
I9
sa(dp14279
g2
VWell, if I can get them working at all, a lot more than ten minutes!
p14280
sg4
I15
sa(dp14281
g2
VWhat are you\u2026what are you doing?
p14282
sg4
I6
sa(dp14283
g2
VCrash it?!
p14284
sg4
I2
sa(dp14285
g2
VNot to mention taking out yourself!
p14286
sg4
I6
sa(dp14287
g2
VNot like this, you haven't! Look, in addition to the weapons, the inertial dampeners are out. You'll need to impact Michael's jumper with enough force to do some serious damage, which means a lot of speed when you hit that tower. Look, this is a suicide mission.
p14288
sg4
I47
sa(dp14289
g2
VOkay, you're good to go.
p14290
sg4
I5
sa(dp14291
g2
VI will. You make sure you don't accelerate too fast coming out of the jumper bay. I mean, if you hit the gas too hard, you're going to\u2026flatten like a pancake.
p14292
sg4

VGreat. (to Sheppard, excited) You don't have to do your kamikaze run.
p14310
sg4
I12
sa(dp14311

VWell, you just have to fly up to the tower, get in proximity, dial the DHD to a random planet. We'll have Radek lower the gate shield, allowing the vortex to obliterate Michael's puddle jumper\u2026or most of it.

p14354

VAll right, short range sensors are good to go. Start the sweep.
p14388
sg4
I12
sa(dp14389
g2
VGreat. So\u2026it should take about thirty minutes to scan the entire planet, which means I've got plenty of time to get down to the cafeteria, get myself some of that fine almond biscotti and a Yoo-hoo, and be back in time for you to tell me you have found nothing.
p14390
sg4
I50
sa(dp14391

VYes, of course we did.
p14392

VShall we?
p14398
sg4
I2
sa(dp14399

VAccording to this, the device is emitting a low-level energy signature in an oscillating pattern.
p14400

VNo. Radiation's minimal, but\u2014
p14402

p14406

p14412
sg4
I3
sa(dp14413

VThanks! Well, pull up a chair, Radek. We've got some work to do. All right\u2026
p14414
sg4
I15
sa(dp14415
g2
VAll over. The electromagnetic radiation this device is giving off covers the entire city and well beyond.
p14416
sg4
I17
sa(dp14417
g2
VOh, it's not. I mean, at least, according to this, it's operating at a relatively low frequency. I think, at worst, some people may experience, you know, headaches or trouble sleeping.
p14418
sg4
I31
sa(dp14419
g2
VI'm not getting anywhere with that. I mean, despite the fact that I am\u2026a genius.
p14420
sg4
I15
sa(dp14421
g2
VAw, same diff. I don't get it. You know, this-this script appears to be a lot less complicated than many we've encountered. It's only twelve symbols in an endlessly repeating yet varying sequence.
p14422
sg4
I33
sa(dp14423
g2
VI'm figuring out the alien's password\u2026
p14424
sg4
I6
sa(dp14425
g2
VNo, no, it makes sense. I mean, every kid with a computer password-protects. Why wouldn't an alien?
p14426
sg4
I17
sa(dp14427
g2
VThere. Why didn't I see that before?
p14428
sg4
I7
sa(dp14429
g2
VThe pattern isn't in the text, it's in the spaces between the text\u2014each exactly twelve symbols in length. Each section of text is a multiple of twelve, twenty-four, forty-eight, ninety-six\u2026separated by a twelve-symbol space. Look, it's\u2014it's a puzzle. It's a\u2026prompt.
p14430
sg4
I40
sa(dp14431
g2
V(excited) I'm running pattern recognition software on the twelve-symbol sequence. Hopefully I can come up with a twelve-symbol permutation that I can feed directly back into the device. And if I'm right\u2026if we're right\u2026we unlock the alien laptop.
p14432
sg4
I38
sa(dp14433
g2
VThat is the historical, scientific, and technological records of an extinct civilization. And if this device is any indication, a highly advanced one at that. I mean, medical breakthroughs. specifications for advanced weaponry\u2026
p14434
sg4
I33
sa(dp14435

V(hesitant) It\u2026is.
p14436

I2
sa(dp14437

VNo, no, no. No, no, no. No buts. A "by the way", maybe.
p14438
sg4
I13
sa(dp14439
g2
VWell, it's like I said. The device contains the records for a long-dead civilization. But it also contains the chemical building blocks for a silicon-based life form.
p14440
sg4
I27
sa(dp14441
g2
VThis device was designed to\u2026seed planets with organisms that would, in time, evolve into a sentient race. Once that sentient race reached a certain level of intellectual maturity, they could then benefit from the information left for them by their extinct ancestors.
p14442
sg4
I42
sa(dp14443
g2
VI'm not sure. I mean, obviously, they didn't complete their journey. They ended up here instead. Still, with the help of the Daedalus, we could ensure that it finally reached its target destination.
p14444
sg4
I33
sa(dp14445
g2
VWhich is where the "oh, by the way" comes in. Look, this device is set up in such a way that accessing the data would do irreparable damage to the biological samples.
p14446
sg4
I32
sa(dp14447
g2
VEither we take the data, or we send it on its way. We can't do both.
p14448

I16
sa(dp14449
g2
VHow long have you been standing there?
p14450
sg4
I7
sa(dp14451

VI'm always deep in thought. It keeps me sharp. And\u2026sleepless.
p14452
sg4
I10

VMmm. I'm just analyzing the readings from the radiation the device is emitting.
p14454

VHey, I'm just killing time 'til Woolsey gives us the green light to start data retrieval on that thing.
p14456
sg4
I19

VOf course. This is huge. The chronicled achievements of an alien race. Are you kidding me?
p14458
sg4
I16
sa(dp14459
g2
VWhoa, wait a minute.
p14460
sg4
I4
sa(dp14461

VThe modulated ultra-low frequency emanating from the device. I've seen something like this before\u2026Oh, no.
p14462
sg4
I15
sa(dp14463
g2
V(frantic) We need to get rid of it! Look, the energy signature that device is giving off is very similar to one we encountered on M1B-129. It can induce mass hallucinations.
p14464
sg4
I31
sa(dp14465

VAlrighty. Here we are, all fixed up and ready to roll.

p14470

I5
sa(dp14471
g2
V(petulant) I'm sorry. You know, I don't mean to complain or anything. It's just that, you know, I have spent the better part of a day making sure this was in working order. It would be kinda nice just to, you know, get a little face time with the\u2014

V(awed) Neat.
p14474

p14476

I17

g2
VSo, you really had no idea that what you were seeing wasn't real?
p14478
sg4
I13
sa(dp14479
g2
V(smug) Well, with all due respect, I think they knew they couldn't "fool me", so they, you know, didn't bother. They just\u2026concentrated on you two.
p14480
sg4
I25
sa(dp14481
g2
VAnd I know what you're implying, all right? But my mind was clear. All right, that device was found because of my brilliant thinking, and, as much as I hate to admit it, a little help from Zelenka.

p14492
sg4
I57
sa(dp14493
g2
VWell, because I do this for a living. I mean, super double tip-top secret stuff. I mean, I haven't published a paper in a decade&emdash;not one that can be read by the general public, and I'm kinda hard to get ahold of, what with living in another galaxy and all.
p14494
sg4
I50
sa(dp14495

sg4
I20
sa(dp14497
g2
VA-a beautiful woman\u2026that, um, they would maybe not think that I was\u2026like, a complete loser. Like, it would be, like, one day. The first night we were there, and then you could be off to Chippewa Falls. I mean, it could be fun?

p14522

I9
sa(dp14523

V(scoffing) He didn't send the jet to be nice; he sent the jet to rub it in my face. Look, I was always one step ahead of this guy during school, and now that we're in the "real world", he wants to show me that, as far as most of the planet is concerned, he's a lot more successful than I am. And what is with the evening attire? We're going to a science talk, for god's sake. Who the hell does he think he is?

VOkay\u2026here's how I think it went down. You were working with the government. Someone there trusted you\u2026a lot and let you see something you weren't supposed to see, or maybe you were sent something by accident. Who knows? You saw a paper about a matter bridge\u2014a project that was shut down due to the adverse effects of exotic particles. You read it. You realized that if the bridge was used merely as a transfer of energy, say, heat, there would be no exotic particle creation, and thus no adverse effects. So you co-opted the science as your own, made a few changes to make yourself feel better, and got to work, dismissing the original author's warnings about the inherent instability of time-space bridges. How am I doing so far?
p14652
sg4

p14820

p14822
sg4
I23
sa(dp14823
g2
VMaybe we've been approaching this the wrong way. We've been trying to force so much power through the bridge that it overloads it. I mean, maybe we should be trying to\u2026starve it. I mean, suck so much power from its generator that it stalls it out.
p14824

VI think it's highly unlikely. Besides, geoengineering's a dumb pursuit anyway. I mean, no one person's going to solve global warming. We all have to do our part.
p14888
sg4
I28
sa(dp14889
g2
VWell, they were going our way anyway.
p14890
sg4
I7
sa(dp14891
g2
VRight.
p14892
sg4
I1
sa(dp14893
g2
V(realizing) Right! Wait, you were legally dead a few hours ago. You were practically frozen. You really want to\u2026
p14894
sg4
I19
sa(dp14895
g2
VNah\u2026
p14896
sg4
I1
sa(dp14897
g2
VI'm trying this whole, um, "humble" thing out. It seems to be quite a hit with  the ladies.
p14898
sg4
I18
sa(dp14899
g2
VJust a matter of minutes.
p14900
sg4
I5
sa(dp14901
g2
VYes, I've made all the necessarily modifications. But, for the record, I still say the shield is a better idea.
p14902
sg4
I20
sa(dp14903
g2
VLook, that cloak offers us no protection whatsoever. If that hive opens up on us\u2014-
p14904
sg4
I15
sa(dp14905
g2
VWhat, you're assuming they don't? Look, we've been tracking them for days. They're headed straight for us. I think it's safe to say they've got some inside information!
p14906
sg4
I28
sa(dp14907
g2
V(grumbling) Right.
p14908
sg4
I2
sa(dp14909
g2
VOkay. Cloak's engaged. They should be here momentarily.
p14910
sg4
I8
sa(dp14911
g2
V(puzzled) Nothing. From what I can tell, they're just sitting here.
p14912
sg4
I11
sa(dp14913
g2
VWhoa, hang on. We're receiving a transmission. It's a file of some kind.
p14914
sg4
I13
sa(dp14915
g2
VYeah.
p14916
sg4
I1
sa(dp14917
g2
VIt's nothing\u2026just a random bunch of\u2026 (snapping fingers) Wait a second.
p14918
sg4
I11
sa(dp14919
g2
V(intrigued) Well, it's encrypted. Using the same kind of algorithm we use on the Daedalus.
p14920
sg4
I15
sa(dp14921
g2
V(puzzled) I don't know. It's like the file's corrupted somehow.
p14922
sg4
I10
sa(dp14923
g2
VI have no idea.
p14924
sg4
I4
sa(dp14925
g2
V(over radio) The file was corrupted. We were only able to catch a few words here and there.
p14926
sg4
I18
sa(dp14927
g2
VSomething to do with Jennifer's gene therapy?
p14928
sg4
I7
sa(dp14929
g2
VWhatever he wants, it must be really important.
p14930
sg4
I8
sa(dp14931
g2
VIf we do that, we might as well just drop the cloak. Then they'll be able to trace our radio signal and know exactly where we are. No. We might be able to do it from the jumper, though. You know, approach the hive cloaked and communicate with them from there.
p14932
sg4
I51
sa(dp14933
g2
VYes, but the jumper's a lot more maneuverable than the city. Look, besides, this isn't the first time we've flown up to Todd's doorstep in a jumper.
p14934
sg4
I27
sa(dp14935
g2
VNo, there's too much data missing. That is as good as we're going to get.
p14936
sg4
I15
sa(dp14937
g2
VThey should be. I mean, there's no reason why they\u2014
p14938
sg4
I10
sa(dp14939
g2
VWhoa.
p14940
sg4
I1
sa(dp14941
g2
VI'm not picking up any life signs on board.
p14942
sg4
I9
sa(dp14943
g2
V(annoyed) We've been tracking their approach for a few days now, remember? It didn't just pop into our space like that other Daedalus did. Look, we know that they don't show up on our scans when they're hibernating. I'd say that's probably a more logical explanation.
p14944
sg4
I46
sa(dp14945
g2
VWell, they could've preprogrammed the ship to fly here on its own, enter orbit, even send a prerecorded signal.
p14946
sg4
I19
sa(dp14947
g2
VWell, there's only one way to find out.
p14948
sg4
I8
sa(dp14949
g2
VWhy is it that I find empty hives even creepier than the ones that are full of Wraith?
p14950
sg4
I18
sa(dp14951
g2
VAll right. Just\u2026give me a few seconds.
p14952
sg4
I7
sa(dp14953
g2
VAll right.
p14954
sg4
I2
sa(dp14955
g2
VWell, I was right. They're all in their hibernation pods.
p14956
sg4
I10
sa(dp14957
g2
VThere are several large chambers in the aft section of the hive. The weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.
p14958
sg4
I29
sa(dp14959
g2
VWell, the normal operating procedure would be to leave a few crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time. But since they all went in, I would assume there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.
p14960
sg4
I54
sa(dp14961
g2
VThen they never will.
p14962
sg4
I4
sa(dp14963
g2
VSome kind of power fluctuation. I'm reading minor malfunctions in several of the ship's systems. Hang on\u2026I got Todd's video file. It looks like it's intact.
p14964
sg4
I26
sa(dp14965
g2
VWell, it must've happened in transmission, some kind of a glitch in the comm system. The original, it's all there.
p14966
sg4
I20
sa(dp14967
g2
VAll right.
p14968
sg4
I2
sa(dp14969
g2
VWait a second. We didn't give them\u2014
p14970
sg4
I7
sa(dp14971
g2
V(into radio) I know! I know! Power fluctuations. Look, it's like I said. Some of the ship's systems are acting up a little.
p14972
sg4
I23
sa(dp14973
g2
V(impatient) Yeah, give me a few minutes.
p14974
sg4
I7
sa(dp14975
g2
VHow you doing?
p14976
sg4
I3
sa(dp14977
g2
VOoh, that good, huh?
p14978
sg4
I4
sa(dp14979
g2
VYou did?
p14980
sg4
I2
sa(dp14981
g2
VWell, is there anything you can do about it?
p14982
sg4
I9
sa(dp14983
g2
VWhat?
p14984
sg4
I1
sa(dp14985
g2
VWhat are you talking about?
p14986
sg4
I5
sa(dp14987
g2
VOh that. You get used to it. It helps to have a massive ego.
p14988
sg4
I14
sa(dp14989
g2
VLook, I don't know much about Wraith physiology, but I know you. And if anyone can make this work, you can.
p14990
sg4
I21
sa(dp14991
g2
V(into radio) Yeah, I did it when I first got here. Why?
p14992
sg4
I12
sa(dp14993
g2
V(confused) What are you talking about?
p14994
sg4
I6
sa(dp14995
g2
VThat's impossible.
p14996
sg4
I2
sa(dp14997
g2
VLook, I don't know what to tell you, all right? I pulled that schematic directly from the ship's database.
p14998
sg4
I19
sa(dp14999
g2
V(sarcastic) Oh, great. So now we have to contend with starving Wraith who are just learning to use their teeth?
p15000
sg4
I20
sa(dp15001
g2
VWell, the power fluctuations. They must be more widespread than I thought.
p15002
sg4
I12
sa(dp15003
g2
VSo, there must be a-a safety protocol of some kind. When there's an interruption of the power, the pods shut down and automatically release their occupant.
p15004
sg4
I26
sa(dp15005
g2
V(weakly) They might be? I'm\u2026I never actually figured out what was wrong, so\u2026
p15006
sg4
I13
sa(dp15007
g2
V(defensively) Well, I don't know. Maybe? We could always go down and look.
p15008
sg4
I13
sa(dp15009
g2
VWhere the hell did that wall come from? That wasn't there when we came in!
p15010
sg4
I15
sa(dp15011
g2
VI don't know.
p15012
sg4
I3
sa(dp15013
g2
VUh\u2026okay. Looks like, if we go back the way we came a bit, that we should be able to hook up with another corridor that loops around the other side of the dart bay.
p15014
sg4
I34
sa(dp15015
g2
VAll right, well\u2026
p15016
sg4
I3
sa(dp15017
g2
VAll right, this is it. Through here, about a hundred meters, then we are there.
p15018
sg4
I15
sa(dp15019
g2
VYou're telling me. The dart bay's on the other side of that. This is the only way out of here.
p15020
sg4
I20
sa(dp15021
g2
VActually, I have a theory about that.
p15022
sg4
I7
sa(dp15023
g2
VLook, these glitches we've been experiencing, they're not confined to power regulation. They're in every major system.
p15024
sg4
I17
sa(dp15025
g2
VI know. But think about it. The Wraith ships are basically organic, right? I mean, they are capable of self-regeneration when they're damaged. But not just the hull. The same systems regulate internal structure as well, so if those systems are malfunctioning along with the others\u2026
p15026
sg4
I46
sa(dp15027
g2
VNot\u2026repairing so much as\u2026reconfiguring. Look, before he was killed, Williams said he saw the wall melt. We've experienced it ourselves. I mean, dead ends popping up when they're supposed to be open corridors.
p15028
sg4
I33
sa(dp15029
g2
VFrom what I can tell, yes.
p15030
sg4
I6
sa(dp15031
g2
VActually, I can't do that because the communications systems are now completely offline.
p15032
sg4
I13
sa(dp15033
g2
VLook, what do you want me to do? I mean if I knew what was causing this, I could do something about it, but these malfunctions are showing up everywhere! I mean, they seem to be entirely random!
p15034
sg4
I38
sa(dp15035
g2
VFor the time being, yes. Now, I do have an idea. We revive Todd.
p15036
sg4
I14
sa(dp15037
g2
VHe knows more about this ship than anyone. Maybe he can help me figure out what wrong with it.
p15038
sg4
I19
sa(dp15039
g2
V(dismissive) He was just a warrior drone. Look, we've long suspected that they spend the majority of their life under the controlling mental influence of the other Wraith. It's not surprising if you remove that influence, they revert to an animal state. But that shouldn't happen with Todd, theoretically.
p15040
sg4
I49
sa(dp15041
g2
VGreat.
p15042
sg4
I1
sa(dp15043
g2
VOkay, so navigation's acting up. Look, whatever we decide, we gotta do it quickly because I cannot stay ahead of these malfunctions for much longer.
p15044
sg4
I25
sa(dp15045
g2
V(hesitantly) You know, I did\u2026I tried that already.
p15046
sg4
I8
sa(dp15047
g2
V(sighing) Okay, all right. You know what? Just go ahead. Boy, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the pod this morning.
p15048
sg4
I23
sa(dp15049
g2
V(annoyed) Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you!
p15050
sg4
I10
sa(dp15051
g2
VI haven't done anything! They've been acting all screwy since the moment we came on board!
p15052
sg4
I16
sa(dp15053
g2
V(annoyed) Well, aside from the fact that every time I try to fix something, something else breaks? Fine.
p15054
sg4
I18
sa(dp15055
g2
VI think it's more than likely. It's probably going to get worse.
p15056
sg4
I12
sa(dp15057
g2
VWell, I have been able to identify that safety protocol I was talking about. I won't be able to override it completely, but I should be able to make a few key alterations.
p15058
sg4
I33
sa(dp15059
g2
VWell, I mean the simplest thing to do would be to make it so the pods don't release the Wraith when they shut down. That would kill them. Basically, suffocate them.
p15060
sg4
I31
sa(dp15061
g2
VYeah, but are they? I mean, they've taken the treatment. They no longer feed.
p15062
sg4
I14
sa(dp15063
g2
VAll right.
p15064
sg4
I2
sa(dp15065
g2
VAll right\u2026I've created a program to override the safety protocol. You sure you want me to do this?
p15066
sg4
I18
sa(dp15067
g2
VAll right.
p15068
sg4
I2
sa(dp15069
g2
VIt's one of the hibernation chambers. It's not accepting the new command.
p15070
sg4
I12
sa(dp15071
g2
VNo, it's no good. I can't access it from here.
p15072
sg4
I10
sa(dp15073
g2
VWell, it's one of the smaller auxiliary chambers, so\u2026a-a couple of dozen at the most?
p15074
sg4
I15
sa(dp15075
g2
V(into radio) What? What is it?
p15076
sg4
I6
sa(dp15077
g2
VHow many got out?
p15078
sg4
I4
sa(dp15079
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard. You're going to want to get up here.
p15080
sg4
I11
sa(dp15081
g2
VIt looks like Todd's estimate of how long the ship's going to last is a little off.
p15082
sg4
I17
sa(dp15083
g2
VYou remember that hole we saw? It's getting bigger, it's beginning to threaten the hull integrity, but that's not the biggest problem. See that? (he points at another terminal) That is a line of structural weakness right across the width of the hive. If there's an explosive decompression, this entire thing could be ripped in half.
p15084
sg4
I56
sa(dp15085
g2
V(into radio) Look, the controls are malfunctioning. I can't seem to override them. Just give me a minute.
p15086
sg4
I18
sa(dp15087
g2
V(panicked) Oh, no. Uh, guys? You need to get out of there now. You hear me? Get out of there now!
p15088
sg4
I21
sa(dp15089
g2
V(frantic) Sheppard! Come in! Please!
p15090
sg4
I5
sa(dp15091
g2
V(relieved) Oh, thank god. Then I take it the bulkhead held?
p15092
sg4
I11
sa(dp15093
g2
VLook, I was able to seal off the section so we won't depressurize, but you need to get down here\u2026
p15094
sg4
I20
sa(dp15095
g2
VOh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
p15096
sg4
I9
sa(dp15097
g2
VThe force of the ship's tearing itself apart. It's shifted our trajectory. We're headed straight for the planet!
p15098
sg4
I18
sa(dp15099
g2
VI would say "screwed" is an apt description.
p15100
sg4
I8
sa(dp15101
g2
VNo, we're going to survive reentry. In fact, it'll even slow us down a little. But nowhere near enough.
p15102
sg4
I19
sa(dp15103
g2
VLand, water\u2014at the speed we're traveling, it's not going to matter. We're going to be vaporized on impact!
p15104
sg4
I18
sa(dp15105
g2
VLike what?
p15106
sg4
I2
sa(dp15107
g2
V(focusing) I don't know\u2026okay, right. Forward maneuvering thrusters. They should be unaffected, but they're not getting any power, because the propulsion conduits have been ripped in half. All right, look, I may be able to reroute power to them, so they can slow our descent.
p15108
sg4
I45
sa(dp15109
g2
V(despairing) The only problem is, I haven't a clue how to do it! Look, I mean, even if the systems weren't all malfunctioning, it would still take me a few hours to create that kind of work-around.
p15110
sg4
I37
sa(dp15111
g2
VHey, you just take your time.
p15112
sg4
I6
sa(dp15113
g2
VIt's not enough!
p15114
sg4
I3
sa(dp15115
g2
VI'm on it!
p15116
sg4
I3
sa(dp15117
g2
VThat's it. That's all the power we've got!
p15118
sg4
I8
sa(dp15119
g2
VThis is it! We're about to lose inertial dampeners.
p15120
sg4
I9
sa(dp15121
g2
VThere you are. I've been looking all over for you. What, is your radio not working? I called like a thousand times!
p15122

I22
sa(dp15123
g2
VAll right, here\u2026
p15124
sg4
I3
sa(dp15125

VWho, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just want to check your earwig. Here we go.
p15126
sg4
I15
sa(dp15127
g2
VThere we go. It's probably just a dead battery. Come on, it's schnitzel day. We've got to hurry though, 'cause it's going fast.
p15128
sg4
I23
sa(dp15129
g2
VSo what happened?
p15130
sg4
I3
sa(dp15131

VWell, hello? Our lunch date? You were supposed to meet me like, half an hour ago.
p15132
sg4
I16

g2
VHey. What's wrong? You seem distracted. Is something bothering you?
p15134
sg4
I10
sa(dp15135

V(interrupting) Did I do something? Oh, I did, didn't I? What did I do?
p15136
sg4
I14
sa(dp15137
g2
V(into radio) Just a second. (handing radio to Neeva) It's for you. Working fine, apparently.
p15138
sg4
I15
sa(dp15139
g2
V(impatiently activating his own radio) What's wrong with Zelenka? Is he complaining about another one of his so-called migraines? 'Cause if he is, you can send him right down to the\u2014
p15140
sg4
I31

VWhat, stabbed? What do you mean stabbed? Like, with a knife stabbed? By who?
p15142

g2
VAll right, we're on our way!
p15144
sg4
I6

V(worried) So\u2026so what? Is he going to die?
p15146
sg4
I8
sa(dp15147
g2
V(sounding like from a distance) Jennifer.
p15148
sg4
I6
sa(dp15149
g2
V(loudly) Jennifer!
p15150
sg4
I2
sa(dp15151
g2
VYou're acting weird. What's wrong with you?
p15152
sg4
I7
sa(dp15153
g2
VThey've managed to stop the bleeding, but he's lost a lot of blood.
p15154
sg4
I13
sa(dp15155
g2
VIt's a light coma. I mean, they figure he should recover, barring any, you know, complications.
p15156
sg4
I16
sa(dp15157
g2
VNo. No, she\u2026excused herself\u2014said she wasn't feeling well.
p15158
sg4
I8
sa(dp15159
g2
VWell, you got me. I mean she's been acting strange all day\u2014aloof, distracted. I found her wandering Atlantis looking lost. You know, I got her to the infirmary, but she just stood there like she'd never held a scalpel before.
p15160
sg4
I40
sa(dp15161
g2
VShe's in her quarters, resting.
p15162

VAm I\u2026interrupting?
p15168
sg4
I2
sa(dp15169
g2
VGood. I mean um\u2026I just dropped by to let you know that uh\u2026Beckett is on his way back. He'll be able to fill in for you while you're, um\u2026ill.
p15170
sg4
I29
sa(dp15171
g2
VYeah, we've, uh, sent a puddle jumper for him.
p15172
sg4
I9
sa(dp15173
g2
V(dismissively) Well, he's in some remote desert village. It'll take too long to walk back to the 'gate, so it's easier to, you know, just hitch a ride.
p15174
sg4
I28
sa(dp15175
g2
V(puzzled at her reaction) Yeah.
p15176
sg4
I5

p15184
sg4
I8
sa(dp15185
g2
VIn a puddle jumper?
p15186
sg4
I4
sa(dp15187
g2
VA few. For starters, you don't have the Ancient gene, so you can't fly one, but you already know that.
p15188
sg4
I20
sa(dp15189
g2
VOf course I can. That's not the point. Look, you should be back in the infirmary.

I16
sa(dp15191
g2
V(surprised) What, now?
p15192
sg4
I3
sa(dp15193

I2
sa(dp15197
g2
VReally?
p15198
sg4
I1
sa(dp15199
g2
VWell\u2026yeah! I mean, I'd have to get a blanket though, because the mainland's groundcover is loaded with allergens.
p15200
sg4
I18
sa(dp15201
g2
V(stepping away from her) Wait. W-w-w-wait. No, no, no, no, no. Look, you look. You should go back to the infirmary.

VNo, no, yeah, I don't\u2026no\u2026yes! Just\u2026I\u2026will you stop! Look, I don't know what is wrong with you, but you are clearly not yourself. I'm taking you back to the infirmary.

VWell, you can argue all you want, I'm not letting you\u2014
p15208
sg4
I11
sa(dp15209
g2
V(firmly) Jennifer\u2026now I need you to listen to me. As soon as you are cured of whatever it is that is affecting you, you're going to thank me for this. So, let's go.
p15210
sg4
I33
sa(dp15211
g2
V(horrified) What're you doing?
p15212
sg4
I4
sa(dp15213
g2
VNot that I know of. I mean, she was perfectly fine up until yesterday.
p15214
sg4
I14
sa(dp15215
g2
VDisorders? She tried to kill me!
p15216
sg4
I6
sa(dp15217
g2
V(insistent) Hey, I saw the look in her eye. She\u2026wait a second. What if she had something to do with Zelenka? What if she's the one who stabbed him?
p15218
sg4
I29
sa(dp15219
g2
V(peeved) Strange?! Doctor Keller wouldn't point a gun at me. And she certainly wouldn't stab Zelenka.
p15220
sg4
I16
sa(dp15221
g2
VWhat artifacts?
p15222
sg4
I2
sa(dp15223
g2
VWell, I think I figured out what happened. The artifact that that woman described? It rang a bell, so I did a little research. Turns out, a few years ago, SG-1 encountered a similar device in the Glastonbury cavern.
p15224
sg4
I39
sa(dp15225
g2
VExactly!
p15226
sg4
I1
sa(dp15227
g2
VOkay, look. SG-1 discovered an Ancient device. There were these stones, and if you place them in one of several recesses around the outside of the device, it activates it, and allows you to connect with someone far, far away\u2014across the galaxy, inter-galactically even, as was the case with Daniel Jackson and Vala.
p15228
sg4
I53
sa(dp15229
g2
VI think so, yes.
p15230
sg4
I4
sa(dp15231
g2
VAh, my first question as well. Then I remembered Janus's lab\u2026.
p15232
sg4
I11
sa(dp15233
g2
V(voiceover) We have recovered tons of Ancient technology from there. And we're still in the process of cataloging it all. Anyways, a few weeks ago? Jennifer visited me while I was working there.
p15234
sg4
I33
sa(dp15235
g2
VYeah, almost, almost there.
p15236
sg4
I4
sa(dp15237
g2
VI know. I know. I know.
p15238
sg4
I6
sa(dp15239
g2
V(distracted by work) God, this is amazing! These are the initial design concepts for a personal cloaking device. I mean, Janus never got around to actually making it. But I think, you know given enough time, I might be able to actually\u2026 (notices what she's doing, and stutters, panicked) Hey! D-d-d-d-! We haven't cataloged those yet!
p15240
sg4
I56
sa(dp15241
g2
V(scolding) What did we say about that?
p15242
sg4
I7
sa(dp15243
g2
VThese stones must somehow be connected to the Ancient terminal that woman Neeva found.
p15244
sg4
I14
sa(dp15245
g2
VWell, it must've been initialized already. Maybe Janus did it thousands of years ago or maybe a tech initialized it after we discovered the lab. Look, the point is that Jennifer was obviously the last person to touch this, which is why it connected to her.
p15246
sg4
I46
sa(dp15247
g2
V(concerned) Yes. I've been going over the SGC files on that, and there's still a lot of unanswered questions about how it works.
p15248
sg4
I23
sa(dp15249
g2
VI don't know. Maybe. I mean\u2026probably.
p15250
sg4
I6
sa(dp15251
g2
VThere is only one option!
p15252
sg4
I5
sa(dp15253
g2
VIt was activated on that end, it's the initial transmitter. The only way to sever the connection is to shut it down at the source.
p15254
sg4
I25
sa(dp15255
g2
V(reluctantly) No, not yet.
p15256
sg4
I4
sa(dp15257
g2
V(disgusted) And we'll be stuck with this\u2026other woman in Keller's body?
p15258
sg4
I11
sa(dp15259
g2
VHeh, you're in no position to make any demands\u2014
p15260
sg4

sa(dp15261
g2
V(weakly) \u2014young lady.

g2
VWhat?! Forget it!
p15264
sg4
I3
sa(dp15265
g2
V(protesting) A few hours?! You could've told us that before!
p15266
sg4
I10
sa(dp15267
g2
VYeah, but I could've packed some extra power bars, some water, not to mention proper insoles.
p15268
sg4
I16
sa(dp15269
g2
V(annoyed) Yeah, keep walking!
p15270
sg4
I4

VThey won't know you. You're in Jennifer Keller's body, remember?
p15272
sg4
I10
sa(dp15273
g2
VYou don't have a choice.
p15274
sg4
I5
sa(dp15275
g2
VWe hear that this village holds a number of Ancient artifacts, most notably a communication terminal about yay big, roundish\u2026 (he slows his words as he sees the couple's wary looks) \u2026grooves along the outside? Yes?
p15276
sg4
I36
sa(dp15277
g2
VNo, no, no, no, no. Look, we just want to take a look at it. This may sound strange, but we think it may have been inadvertently activated, and it's\u2026well, it's causing some problems for us on Atlantis.
p15278
sg4
I38
sa(dp15279
g2
V(muttering to himself) Oh, for god's sake.
p15280
sg4
I7
sa(dp15281
g2
VI don't believe this. How did she escape?
p15282
sg4
I8
sa(dp15283
g2
V(rueful) Let's hope we find her before they do.
p15284
sg4
I9
sa(dp15285
g2
VHey! Hey!
p15286
sg4
I2
sa(dp15287
g2
VIs she going to be all right?
p15288
sg4
I7
sa(dp15289
g2
VAnd we need access to that communication terminal. We need to shut it down right now!
p15290
sg4
I16
sa(dp15291
g2
VWell, simply put, it makes a psychic link between two people. So Doctor Keller and this\u2026."Neeva Casol" have switched places. They're in each other's bodies.
p15292
sg4
I25
sa(dp15293
g2
VAll right.
p15294
sg4
I2
sa(dp15295
g2
V(worriedly) It's still on!
p15296
sg4
I4
sa(dp15297
g2
VWell, there's no switches. But it looks almost identical to the one SG-1 found.
p15298
sg4
I14
sa(dp15299
g2
VBelieve me, I'm trying. Look, there's no way to access the control crystal. There doesn't seem to be a way to shut this thing off!
p15300
sg4
I25
sa(dp15301
g2
VWell, I don't know. I mean, maybe? I just\u2026I'm just not sure if the explosion will cause a-a sudden power surge\u2026
p15302
sg4
I21
sa(dp15303
g2
VWell, SG-1 dialed the 'gate and tossed the device into the vortex of a forming wormhole. It disintegrated instantly. But, you know, it's too far to carry it back to the 'gate!
p15304
sg4
I32
sa(dp15305
g2
VI'm not sure we've got the time\u2026
p15306
sg4
I7

g2
VOh, just\u2026visiting a friend in the infirmary.
p15308
sg4
I7
sa(dp15309
g2
VI know.
p15310
sg4
I2
sa(dp15311
g2
VI don't know about that. According to Jennifer, her accomplice was just about to kill her when we shut down the communication terminal.
p15312
sg4
I23
sa(dp15313
g2
VWell, I guess we'll never know.
p15314
sg4
I6
sa(dp15315
g2
VHmm.
p15316
sg4
I1
sa(dp15317
g2
V(brightly) Don't worry. I will make sure of it!
p15318
sg4
I9
sa(dp15319
g2
V(pleased) Hey, you.
p15320
sg4
I3
sa(dp15321
g2
V(unamused) Right. No. She's all alone in the infirmary. I just thought I would, you know, brighten the room up a bit?
p15322
sg4
I22
sa(dp15323
g2
VOh, hey Radek. How're you doing?
p15324
sg4
I6
sa(dp15325
g2
V(dismissively) Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine. He's all perky and rosy cheeked and ready to go back to work.
p15326
sg4
I20
sa(dp15327
g2
V(surprised) Really? You were shot. He was just stabbed.
p15328

sg4
I1
sa(dp15331
g2
V(to Keller) Chocolates?
p15332
sg4
I3
sa(dp15333
g2
VSo, I was thinking that, uh, when you were feeling better, we could maybe, um\u2026you know, go for a ride.
p15334
sg4
I20
sa(dp15335
g2
VYeah, you know, take the puddle jumper, go to the mainland, maybe have a picnic, maybe\u2026lay out under the stars?
p15336
sg4
I20
sa(dp15337
g2
VWhat?
p15338
sg4
I1
sa(dp15339
g2
VNo, it's really me.
p15340
sg4
I4
sa(dp15341
g2
VSo not me. Right. Okay. No. Bad idea.
p15342
sg4
I8
sa(dp15343
g2
VWell, we should tell him anyway.
p15344
sg4
I6
sa(dp15345

VHe might be able to help us. I'm going to at least try.
p15346
sg4
I13
sa(dp15347
g2
VDetective? I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. I realize that you have no way of grasping what's going on here. There's really only one thing you need to understand. If you fail to cooperate, I have the power to ruin your life.
p15348
sg4
I40
sa(dp15349
g2
VI know everything about you. You've never been married. The only thing you own is a car. You have $2,363.00 in the bank and are $13,000.00 in debt\u2026not counting the off-the-books gambling losses to a guy named "Mikey."
p15350
sg4
I38
sa(dp15351
g2
V(smug) What else? You finally passed your detective exam after four years and two failed attempts\u2026
p15352
sg4
I16
sa(dp15353
g2
V\u2026and now barely scrape by on quarterly performance reviews. Am I getting this right?
p15354
sg4
I14
sa(dp15355
g2
VHave some.
p15356
sg4
I2
sa(dp15357
g2
VNo, you weren't.
p15358
sg4
I3
sa(dp15359
g2
VLet's go back further, shall we? You were a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, but were dishonorably discharged for disobeying orders and trying to rescue a field medic trapped behind enemy lines. You were shot down\u2014obviously survived, but unfortunately the crash killed four American soldiers, along with eight civilians.
p15360
sg4
I48
sa(dp15361
g2
VYou avoided jail time. The record was sealed for various "political reasons." These things happen, right?
p15362
sg4
I16
sa(dp15363
g2
VSomehow, you've managed to live with yourself since then, but I'm not sure other people would if they knew the truth.
p15364
sg4
I21
sa(dp15365
g2
V(sadly) Yeah. That's too bad.
p15366
sg4
I5
sa(dp15367
g2
VYou know\u2026I once met another version of you. He was very different.
p15368

g2
VNothing is what you think it is.
p15370
sg4
I7

VLook\u2026we're not bad guys. We just want to keep the planet safe.
p15372
sg4
I12
sa(dp15373
g2
VI don't expect you'll believe me at first. I'm about to tell you some incredible things: wormhole travel through a device called a Stargate, ancient races of humans on other planets, other dimensions in space and time, even infinite variations of our own, known reality, where alternate versions of you and I play out events in ways you can't\u2026possibly imagine.
p15374
sg4
I60
sa(dp15375
g2
VIt was found under a mile of ice in Antarctica five years ago and later moved here. It runs on a power source that extracts energy from vacuum space. We call it a "ZedPM"\u2026well, "ZeePM". Sorry, I'm Canadian. If you have the right genetic code, it allows you to control some pretty cool weaponry remotely with your mind. That's how we were able to defeat the Wraith hive ship that attacked Earth three months ago.
p15376
sg4
I75
sa(dp15377
g2
VWhat? Chairs?
p15378
sg4
I2
sa(dp15379

sg4
I16
sa(dp15381
g2
VDetective?
p15382
sg4
I1
sa(dp15383
g2
VThey're called darts\u2014small, fast, single-pilot attack ships. We're lucky we took out the hive as quickly as we did. Each one can carry hundreds of these things.
p15384
sg4
I27
sa(dp15385
g2
VIs an alien\u2026a Wraith\u2014genetic hybrid between human beings and something called an Iratus bug. It feeds on human energy\u2014literally saps the life out of people using a sucker on their hands. I suppose it all sounds like science fiction to you.
p15386
sg4
I41
sa(dp15387
g2
VMy team and I usually operate out of Atlantis in the Pegasus Galaxy, but we were called back to Earth to deal with this situation because of our expertise with the Wraith. Now, the one that you've encountered has obviously been doing a fairly good job of blending in.
p15388
sg4
I49
sa(dp15389
g2
VBased on your description and the video surveillance from the casino.
p15390

VNormally\u2026they look like that.
p15392

sa(dp15403
g2
VYou okay?
p15404
sg4
I2
sa(dp15405
g2
V(scoffing) It's not my decision. Personally, I think people choose to live in their own happy little delusions. They don't really want to know the truth.
p15406
sg4
I26
sa(dp15407
g2
VJennifer.
p15408
sg4
I1
sa(dp15409
g2
VThey all did. Once we got wind of it and our suspicions were confirmed, the whole thing was ultimately going to be covered up. But you tracked down the target before that could happen.
p15410
sg4
I34
sa(dp15411
g2
VWhich is how you found the motel and the man who reported radiation sickness. He was most likely exposed 'cause he was in the room next door to the Wraith. See, we didn't think to look for bystanders that could've been accidentally exposed due the proximity.
p15412
sg4
I46
sa(dp15413
g2
VNo, no. However, we do believe that the radioactive material in this case is being transferred from the target to the victims. But the source, mmm, it's been shielded from our scanning capabilities.
p15414
sg4
I33
sa(dp15415
g2
V(hesitating a moment) Look, we know that the Wraith don't need to feed as often as the target does. I mean they feed for pleasure, but not in this case. Not if it means leaving a trail behind.
p15416
sg4
I38
sa(dp15417
g2
VIf they're sick or injured, they can regenerate, but it requires energy. We believe that the target is unavoidably exposing himself to high doses of radiation and is having to eat to counteract the effects.
p15418
sg4
I35
sa(dp15419
g2
VHe's building a device. We're not sure of its intended function, but we know that he was able to\u2026salvage certain parts from his crashed dart before we could get to it.
p15420
sg4
I31
sa(dp15421
g2
VThe Wraith are smart. It wouldn't take him long to learn the ins and outs of the way things work around here. We have reason to believe that he has already acquired some of the necessary materials, but he needs more. He also needs untraceable currency, or we would've found him by now.
p15422
sg4
I53
sa(dp15423
g2
VWell, I guess he could rob a bank, but it's risky, and it draws a lot of attention. No, the Wraith love\u2026games. And with their mental abilities, they are very good at them.

VWhat would be the point in cooking over half of the United States?
p15430
sg4
I13

VNot his first choice. He wants to send up a flare signaling the location of Earth to the rest of the Wraith.
p15432

g2
VHe does if he wants to send the message to Pegasus and be rescued in his lifetime.
p15434

VI know you'll probably think this sounds ridiculous, but, uh, a little while ago we accidentally opened a rift in space-time\u2014went through to an alternate version of reality. It was very similar to ours in many ways. We met a team, much like the one I work with, only\u2026you were the leader. You were a hero\u2014saved the world several times over.

VI don't think there's much difference between you\u2026and that other John Sheppard I met. It's amazing how one incident can entirely alter the course of your life. Still, I like to believe you have the same strength of character. That's why I told you the truth.

p15492

g2
V(sighing) No.
p15496
sg4
I2

VI know. It looks like the device tore a small hole in the space-time continuum.
p15498
sg4
I15
sa(dp15499

VNo. It couldn't have been. Most of the energy meant to carry the Wraith transmission went through the rift.

p15516
sg4
I19
sa(dp15517

I19
sa(dp15519
g2
VWell, someone stole our jumper off that ship.
p15520

p15546

p15550
sg4

VI'm not breaking into her room.
p15552
sg4

sa(dp15563

p15564

VWell, is it possible she's turning into a hybrid?
p15566
sg4
I9
sa(dp15567

p15576

p15588

VSo why didn't you say anything?
p15590

g2
VIt doesn't matter, okay? We're gonna fix this. I promise.
p15592
sg4
I10
sa(dp15593
g2
VThey just left her there?
p15594
sg4
I5
sa(dp15595
g2
VI suppose it was Zelenka's idea to shut off the power?
p15596
sg4
I11
sa(dp15597
g2
V(angry) This is ridiculous! They got us stuck in our quarters while the "new guy" takes advice from the B team?!
p15598
sg4
I21
sa(dp15599
g2
VThey are assuming that it tapped into the electric grid by randomly spreading out through the walls and the floors. What if actually grows towards electromagnetic fields? Like a-like a plant growing towards the sun? It's going to head directly for the next available power source.
p15600
sg4
I46
sa(dp15601
g2
VWell, we can use the transporter to get them close, but\u2014
p15602
sg4
I11
sa(dp15603
g2
VWhat?
p15604
sg4
I1
sa(dp15605

VWait a second. Are you talking about drones? What, are you going to fire drones at one of our own people?!
p15606
sg4
I21

g2
VCarson, is it true that Lorne and some of the others are beginning to show symptoms?
p15608

I16

g2
VOh, god.
p15610
sg4
I2
sa(dp15611
g2
VWell, my palms are very sweaty, and-and, uh, my mouth is very dry, and I'm having heart palpitations\u2026?
p15612
sg4
I18
sa(dp15613
g2
VFor god's sake, Carson, how long is this going to go on for?
p15614
sg4
I13
sa(dp15615
g2
V(caustically) He doesn't trust us. Because we're still infected.
p15616
sg4
I9
sa(dp15617
g2
VIt worked. They just sent Ronon in to give her the shot.
p15618
sg4
I12
sa(dp15619
g2
VHe just got there. Look, I'm tapped into their intercom.
p15620
sg4
I10
sa(dp15621
g2
VWhat are you doing?
p15622
sg4
I4
sa(dp15623
g2
VYou-you can't\u2026we're quarantined.
p15624
sg4
I3
sa(dp15625
g2
VA ZPM? Are you kidding me?
p15626
sg4
I6
sa(dp15627
g2
VWell, for one thing, they don't exactly grow on trees.
p15628
sg4
I10
sa(dp15629
g2
V(worried) If this true, it could be very, very bad. I mean, inefficient power generation is the Achilles heel of Wraith technology. It's basically the reason for every technological advantage we have. If this\u2026underling, or whatever it is that Todd calls him, is flying around in a ZPM powered hiveship, then\u2026
p15630
sg4
I51
sa(dp15631
g2
VWe can go in cloaked. Stay in touch through subspace on a secure channel.
p15632
sg4
I14
sa(dp15633
g2
VAlmost in range.
p15634
sg4
I3
sa(dp15635
g2
VAll right, getting readings now. It's a hive, all right. Hmm.
p15636
sg4
I11
sa(dp15637
g2
VI'm reading\u2026a higher than normal energy output. I mean, significantly higher.
p15638
sg4
I11
sa(dp15639
g2
VWell, it's hard to say from this far out.
p15640
sg4
I9
sa(dp15641
g2
VI'm detecting massive energy output.
p15642
sg4
I5
sa(dp15643
g2
V(disturbed) It's growing.
p15644
sg4
I3
sa(dp15645
g2
VThat's what they're doing with the surplus energy\u2014using it to grow a larger, and if I'm reading this correctly, significantly denser outer hull. It makes sense. Normal hives have a limit of growth. I mean, any bigger or heavier and they become impossible to maneuver, let alone get into hyperspace. I mean, you make a simple left turn, and you're torn apart by your own inertia. But with a ZPM\u2026
p15646
sg4
I70
sa(dp15647
g2
VWhen they're done, my guess is that hull will be all but impenetrable.
p15648
sg4
I13
sa(dp15649
g2
VHold on. They're\u2026powering weapons.
p15650
sg4
I4
sa(dp15651
g2
VOf course not. They must just be running a test\u2026
p15652
sg4
I10
sa(dp15653
g2
VHoly crap!
p15654
sg4
I2
sa(dp15655

VI would say\u2014given the enormity of empty space all around us\u2014nonexistent?
p15656
sg4
I11
sa(dp15657
g2
VThey must've figured out a way to increase the sensitivity of their scanners.
p15658
sg4
I13
sa(dp15659
g2
V(caustic) Let me guess, something to do with the ZPM?
p15660
sg4
I10
sa(dp15661
g2
VProbably.
p15662
sg4
I1
sa(dp15663
g2
VNot to mention you could fire back.
p15664
sg4
I7
sa(dp15665
g2
VWe're hit!
p15666
sg4
I2
sa(dp15667
g2
VI'll work out a bypass. Give me a minute.
p15668
sg4
I9
sa(dp15669
g2
VOkay, you should have flight controls now!
p15670
sg4
I7
sa(dp15671
g2
VNot a chance!
p15672
sg4
I3
sa(dp15673
g2
VTodd said the ship isn't finished, right? They haven't adapted the full potential of the ZPM. Well, maybe the battle maxed them out.
p15674

I23
sa(dp15675
g2
VKavanaugh? What the hell are you doing here?
p15676
sg4
I8
sa(dp15677
g2
V(studying the readout) It's Wraith code.
p15678
sg4
I6
sa(dp15679
g2
VI have. Once, when we met another me, and once when we encountered another Daedalus. This signal was sent from another reality.
p15680
sg4
I22
sa(dp15681
g2
VSome Wraith, somewhere, in another reality sent a coded signal\u2014only whatever means they used to access subspace created a rift, allowing the signal to cross into multiple realities, including our own.
p15682
sg4
I31
sa(dp15683
g2
VOh, just give me a second.
p15684
sg4
I6
sa(dp15685
g2
V(sighing in despair) Oh, great.
p15686
sg4
I5
sa(dp15687
g2
VIt's a set of coordinates.
p15688
sg4
I5
sa(dp15689
g2
VEarth.
p15690
sg4
I1
sa(dp15691
g2
VWhy else would they leave like that? It can't be a coincidence. The Wraith know that Earth is a much richer feeding ground than anything in the Pegasus Galaxy, and they've been looking for those coordinates for years.
p15692
sg4
I38
sa(dp15693
g2
VWait a minute. I've got an idea. How many ships do we have available?
p15694
sg4
I14
sa(dp15695
g2
VThen two will have to be enough.
p15696
sg4
I7
sa(dp15697
g2
VLook, that hive may be super-powerful and all, but I'll bet it has to drop out of hyperspace at some point along the way for hull regeneration. I can use the sensor data from the jumpers to extrapolate exactly where that'll be.
p15698
sg4
I42
sa(dp15699
g2
V(interrupting) I won't be! Anyways, we can't wait until they get all the way to Earth. My guess is by that point, they'll be fully adapted to the ZPM.
p15700
sg4
I29
sa(dp15701
g2
VThat's as I figured. That signal was too short and too weak. That ship only detected it because of its obvious improvements to the sensors.
p15702
sg4
I25
sa(dp15703
g2
V(excited) There you are! Look, I've been thinking\u2026
p15704
sg4
I8
sa(dp15705
g2
VThere is another ship that can help defend Earth.
p15706
sg4
I9
sa(dp15707
g2
VThe city\u2026exactly! The only problem is\u2026
p15708
sg4
I6
sa(dp15709
g2
VYeah, but if we want to get there in time to make a difference, we need a full complement.
p15710
sg4
I19
sa(dp15711
g2
VRight.
p15712
sg4
I1
sa(dp15713

p15714

p15726

V(absently) Oh, I'm sure you'll\u2026do fine.
p15728
sg4

g2
VWe're not even close. We're on the edge of the Milky Way.
p15730

p15732

VWe're not sure.
p15734
sg4
I3
sa(dp15735
g2

p15736
sg4
I23

p15738
sg4
I12
sa(dp15739
g2
VOh-kay\u2026this is weird. I'm picking up an energy signature feeding back through the wormhole. It's Wraith.
p15740
sg4
I16
sa(dp15741
g2
VNo, these readings are more like something you-you'd pick up in the middle of a hive.
p15742
sg4
I16
sa(dp15743
g2
V(also worried) Standard Wraith procedure. Keep your victims from dialing out.
p15744
sg4
I11
sa(dp15745
g2
VThere's a 'gate on the hive!
p15746
sg4
I6
sa(dp15747
g2
VThe Wraith always try to block the 'gate of a planet they're attacking\u2014usually  by dialing in. They couldn't do that in this case, so they came up with another solution.
p15748
sg4
I30
sa(dp15749
g2
VWe encountered exactly the same problem on the Midway Station. We had to create a work-around to prevent the Pegasus 'gate from always taking precedent.
p15750

I25
sa(dp15751
g2
VThink that cleared the way?
p15752

VFive minutes to get there, five minutes to recalibrate the DHD for local coordinates.
p15780
sg4
I14
sa(dp15781
g2
V(desperate) Yeah\u2026but we're almost there. I mean\u2026look, did I say five minutes to recalibrate the DHD? I meant two minutes.
p15782
sg4
I20
sa(dp15783
g2
VI'm on it.
p15784

VI've got it! Dialing the Alpha Site now!
p15786
sg4
I8
sa(dp15787
g2
V(drily) I'm alive.
p15788
sg4
I3
sa(dp15789
g2
VAnd I've got you. What else do I need?
p15790
sg4

sa(dp15791
g2
VIt didn't stop him from ambushing you.
p15792

V(drily) You happen to have one handy, do you?
p15794
sg4
I9
sa(dp15795
g2
VJudging by your description, he isn't exactly the "settle-down" kind of guy. I mean, what are the chances he's still going to be there?
p15796
sg4
I24
sa(dp15797
g2
VRonon Dex is in trouble.
p15798
sg4
I5
sa(dp15799
g2
VWell, his life is in danger.
p15800
sg4
I6
sa(dp15801
g2
VWell, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.
p15802
sg4
I6
sa(dp15803
g2
VHey! You're up early!
p15804
sg4
I4
sa(dp15805
g2
VIt is? Uh, gah, I didn't sleep at all, I was up all night thinking about this Ronon situation.
p15806
sg4
I19
sa(dp15807
g2
VNothing. I tried everything: pacing, snacking, bathing\u2026
p15808
sg4
I7
sa(dp15809
g2
VYeah. Like Archimedes.
p15810
sg4
I3
sa(dp15811
g2
VNo, like the Greek mathematician who came up with the Archimedes principle\u2014the physical laws of buoyancy? According to legend, the idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so\u2026look the point is, that the revelation occurred while he was, you know, relaxing. You know, not thinking about the problem. And the solution, as it turned out, was right in front of him all along.
p15812
sg4
I67
sa(dp15813
g2
VI don't know. Maybe? Look, all I know is I was up all night going over it, and I'm drawing a blank. So\u2026I could use a fresh perspective.
p15814
sg4
I28
sa(dp15815
g2
VNo, let's\u2026just go over what we know.
p15816
sg4
I7
sa(dp15817
g2
VRight. He's alone, with Ronon, on the run. So, where would someone like that go? Well, I could think of something like 200 uninhabited planets that would be perfect. Where do you want to start?
p15818
sg4
I35
sa(dp15819
g2
VThank you, Archimedes.
p15820
sg4
I3
sa(dp15821
g2
V(sighing) So we were wrong. It has been known to happen. Hey, I always said this was a long shot.
p15822
sg4
I20
sa(dp15823
g2
VI knew it!
p15824
sg4
I3
sa(dp15825
g2
VWhere's Ronon?
p15826
sg4
I2
sa(dp15827
g2
VI'm going to go, um, see if they're still serving lunch. It's Taquito Tuesday.
p15828
sg4
I14
sa(dp15829
g2
VWell, you know, on the bright side, at least we'll never have to go back to Atlantis and hear Woolsey say "I told you so."
p15830
sg4
I25
sa(dp15831
g2
VOh, sure. I mean, all we have to do is escape from this cell, right? And get past all of the armed Wraith that are guarding the facility. And free Lorne and his team from wherever they're being held. And get back to the jumper, which is probably being disassembled as we speak. And, right, of course, we've got to rescue Ronon, who, I don't know if you happened to notice or not, isn't quite himself!
p15832
sg4
I76
sa(dp15833
g2
VAnd even if we do, then what, huh? I mean, Tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.
p15834
sg4
I22
sa(dp15835
g2
V(sighing) Yeah, of course.
p15836
sg4
I4
sa(dp15837
g2
V(to Teyla) We're going to get him back.
p15838
sg4
I8
sa(dp15839
g2
VAll right, I got it. We tell them we have some vital information that we're willing to give up, but we will only share it with Ronon. So they send Ronon, he shows up, we appeal to him\u2014I mean, the part of him that-that's still\u2026him.
p15840
sg4
I45
sa(dp15841
g2
VHe hasn't been brainwashed as long as Tyre, which means he might be more susceptible to our influence. We convince him to let us out or-or lead us out of here, and-and, you know, worst case scenario, he's not entirely convinced\u2014
p15842
sg4
I41
sa(dp15843
g2
VHey, I'm just spinning here, but, um, we could take advantage of that moment of uncertainty and-and-and\u2026
p15844
sg4
I17
sa(dp15845
g2
V(low, to Sheppard) Do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?
p15846
sg4
I15
sa(dp15847
g2
VTyre freed us! Let's go!
p15848
sg4
I5
sa(dp15849
g2
VNot so good!
p15850
sg4
I3
sa(dp15851
g2
V\u2026I had what they call piano fingers\u2014slim, nimble. You know, it's really no surprise that my parents signed me up for lessons. My first teacher, of course, hailed me as a natural. Big Russian woman, Polanski or Baranski or\u2026
p15852
sg4
I39
sa(dp15853
g2
V\u2026definitely a "ski"\u2026Ronon?
p15854
sg4
I3
sa(dp15855
g2
VHey, uh, how do you feel?
p15856
sg4
I6
sa(dp15857
g2
V(warily) Anyone in particular?
p15858
sg4
I4
sa(dp15859
g2
V(grinning) That-that is a good sign! That's a good sign!
p15860
sg4
I10
sa(dp15861
g2
V(shouting as he leaves) He's back! He's back!
p15862
sg4
I8
sa(dp15863
g2
VI'm telling you, she's hiding him from me.
p15864
sg4
I8
sa(dp15865
g2
VOh, yeah? Every time I go to see him, she tells me that he's "just settled down."
p15866
sg4
I17
sa(dp15867
g2
VI did not drop him, he jumped!
p15868
sg4
I7
sa(dp15869
g2
VWell, he wiggled out of my arms. Look, I said I was sorry. Besides, how much damage could I possibly have done? He fell like, maybe two feet. Stuff like that happens all the time. I mean, I was dropped, like, a dozen times when I was kid.
p15870
sg4
I48
sa(dp15871
g2
VIt's the principle of the thing. Everyone else gets to hold him, why shouldn't I?
p15872
sg4
I15
sa(dp15873
g2
V(studying his display) Hang on a second, we're getting IFF. It's the Daedalus.
p15874
sg4
I13
sa(dp15875
g2
V(puzzled) Well, they were\u2026or they were supposed to be.
p15876
sg4
I9
sa(dp15877
g2
V(worried) They're not going to answer.
p15878
sg4
I6
sa(dp15879
g2
VBecause I'm not reading any life signs.
p15880
sg4
I7
sa(dp15881
g2
VI don't know how they got here, but there's no one on board. At least, no one alive.
p15882
sg4
I18
sa(dp15883
g2
V(dismissively) They wouldn't be sending Daedalus IFF, plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or why we're not picking up life sign readings.
p15884
sg4
I24
sa(dp15885
g2
VYeah, some scorch marks. You think weapon's fire?
p15886
sg4
I8
sa(dp15887
g2
V(perplexed) I'm picking up an energy reading. It's coming from the ship.
p15888
sg4
I12
sa(dp15889
g2
VI don't think so, but I have no idea what's causing it.
p15890
sg4
I12
sa(dp15891
g2
VIf the ship's command systems are as familiar as the rest it, it shouldn't be a problem.
p15892
sg4
I17
sa(dp15893
g2
V(nervously) As far as I can tell.
p15894
sg4
I7
sa(dp15895
g2
VThe ship's operating on emergency power. Some of the systems are barely registering.
p15896
sg4
I13
sa(dp15897
g2
VThat's right.
p15898
sg4
I2
sa(dp15899
g2
V(piqued) Oh sure, I just have to get to engineering.
p15900
sg4
I10
sa(dp15901
g2
V(over radio) Of course it was me. Who else would it be?
p15902
sg4
I12
sa(dp15903
g2
V(smugly) you think we've got a ghost on board or something?
p15904
sg4
I11
sa(dp15905
g2
VWill you please not touch anything?!
p15906
sg4
I6
sa(dp15907
g2
VI've restored basic power to most of the ship. It should be warming up any second now.
p15908
sg4
I17
sa(dp15909
g2
V(exasperated) I'm on it.
p15910
sg4
I4
sa(dp15911
g2
VMan, this ship has been through the wringer. No hyperdrive. Subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair. The shields are virtually depleted.
p15912
sg4
I22
sa(dp15913
g2
V(looking at displays) It's the energy reading. It's spiking. (into radio) Sheppard, come in.
p15914
sg4
I14
sa(dp15915
g2
V(into radio) Something's happening. The energy reading. It's going off the charts!
p15916
sg4
I12
sa(dp15917
g2
VI don't know how. Look, it's not coming from any of the main systems!
p15918
sg4
I14
sa(dp15919
g2
V(over radio) I have no idea, but the energy reading's gone back down the way it was.
p15920
sg4
I17
sa(dp15921
g2
VWait a second. That can't be right.
p15922
sg4
I7
sa(dp15923
g2
VI'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.
p15924
sg4
I10
sa(dp15925
g2
VI just did a sensor sweep, and there's nothing down there but ocean!
p15926
sg4
I13
sa(dp15927
g2
VWell, they wouldn't have done that without telling us.
p15928
sg4
I9
sa(dp15929
g2
V(insistently) I'm not reading anything.
p15930
sg4
I5
sa(dp15931
g2
VNo. According to our instruments, we haven't moved at all.
p15932
sg4
I10
sa(dp15933
g2
VI-I don't know. Just, give me a second. I'll figure it out, all right? In the meantime, I've managed to localize the source of the energy reading. It's coming from a hold on Deck Nine.
p15934
sg4
I35
sa(dp15935
g2
VSheppard, I think I've got something. It's the residual radiation from the flash. It-it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window. But different enough that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.
p15936
sg4
I36
sa(dp15937
g2
VI think we're looking at a new kind of drive.
p15938
sg4
I10
sa(dp15939
g2
VWe didn't. At least, according to the ship's navigational systems.
p15940
sg4
I10
sa(dp15941
g2
VMaybe, just\u2026hang on.
p15942
sg4
I3
sa(dp15943
g2
VOh my god! Sheppard!
p15944
sg4
I4
sa(dp15945
g2
VNo, you don't understand. I know what it is! Look, the residual radiation\u2014it, it's exactly what we recorded when my double arrived on Atlantis from an alternate reality. I can't believe I didn't see this before!
p15946
sg4
I36
sa(dp15947
g2
V(continuing) It's a drive all right. But it didn't move us through space. I think it's moved us into a parallel universe.
p15948
sg4
I22
sa(dp15949
g2
VThat's because they are us. The alternate reality versions of us.
p15950
sg4
I11
sa(dp15951
g2
VOh, no, no, no, no. This is very bad.
p15952
sg4
I9
sa(dp15953
g2
VThis tablet belonged to the other McKay. They weren't part of the original crew. They came here just like us! Look, a ship appeared in orbit over their Atlantis. They came to check it out!
p15954
sg4
I35
sa(dp15955
g2
V(very worried) The ship jumped in another reality, and they were stuck. They-they couldn't get back. Look, eventually, their supplies ran out, and they\u2026
p15956
sg4
I24
sa(dp15957
g2
V(panicked) Don't you realize what this means? They were us, and they failed!
p15958
sg4
I13
sa(dp15959
g2
VUh\u2026yeah, just hold on.
p15960
sg4
I4
sa(dp15961
g2
VAll right\u2026
p15962
sg4
I2
sa(dp15963
g2
VHuh. That's a good question.
p15964
sg4
I5
sa(dp15965
g2
VI'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.
p15966
sg4
I7
sa(dp15967
g2
V(piqued) Offhand, I'd say no. That's what the other McKay was trying to do, and he had\u2026weeks!
p15968
sg4
I17
sa(dp15969
g2
VFine. I'll start with his research. It'll\u2026at least give us a head start.
p15970
sg4
I13
sa(dp15971
g2
VWha-you don't think the other us would've already tried that?
p15972
sg4
I10
sa(dp15973
g2
VHello, residual radiation?
p15974
sg4
I3
sa(dp15975
g2
VAs a matter of fact, yes, we have.
p15976
sg4
I8
sa(dp15977
g2
VMe and the other McKay, who unsurprisingly, is a genius. Not only that, but it looks like the drive was created by yet another McKay from the original reality.
p15978
sg4
I29
sa(dp15979
g2
VWell, there's a certain, um,\u2026elegance to the design that I recognize.
p15980
sg4
I11
sa(dp15981
g2
VWell, admittedly, there are problems, but it is still a monumental achievement.
p15982
sg4
I12
sa(dp15983
g2
VUh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than that. The first problem is navigation. They've developed a coordinate system to, uh, identify the various realities and allowed them to get back. But, uh, obviously that didn't work.
p15984
sg4
I37
sa(dp15985
g2
V(sighing) That's not what bothers me.
p15986
sg4
I6
sa(dp15987
g2
VIt's power generation. I mean, jumping from one reality to another requires massive amounts of power. We're talking ZPM levels here. Obviously they didn't have one of those rattling around, so they\u2026created a capacitor that's constantly drawing power from subspace.
p15988
sg4
I40
sa(dp15989
g2
VAnd\u2026it looks like it's almost charged.
p15990
sg4
I6
sa(dp15991
g2
VThink of it like a-a tap pouring water into a bucket. When the bucket is full, the drive engages. Except this particular tap has no valve.
p15992
sg4
I26
sa(dp15993
g2
VExactly. Which leads me to believe they were tampering with it in a vain attempt to generate more power.
p15994
sg4
I19
sa(dp15995
g2
VAs they got further and further from their own reality, I guess they figured they'd need it to get back. And\u2026here we go.
p15996
sg4
I23
sa(dp15997
g2
VOh, don't look at me. I haven't had time to route the main systems to these control panels. I'm flying blind down here.
p15998
sg4
I23
sa(dp15999
g2
V(noncommittally) Uhn.
p16000
sg4
I2
sa(dp16001
g2
VI'd say slim to none.
p16002
sg4
I5
sa(dp16003
g2
V(over radio) Maybe. I mean, you might be able to get a couple of shots off. Why?
p16004
sg4
I17
sa(dp16005
g2
VSo?
p16006
sg4
I1
sa(dp16007
g2
VWell, I mean\u2026it's not our Atlantis. We have no idea who's down there. Look, we should just stay out of it!
p16008
sg4
I21
sa(dp16009
g2
VI hope you're right.
p16010
sg4
I4
sa(dp16011
g2
VWhat the hell was that?!
p16012
sg4
I5
sa(dp16013
g2
V(high-pitched) No! It's completely shot! I already told you that!
p16014
sg4
I10
sa(dp16015
g2
V(over radio) Sheppard! I have an idea!
p16016
sg4
I7
sa(dp16017
g2
VI set up a few protocols that should increase the efficiency of the alternate reality drive. If I enable them, we might be able to jump sooner.
p16018
sg4
I27
sa(dp16019
g2
VExactly! But if I do this, I can't undo it! I mean, we'll just start jumping faster and faster.
p16020
sg4
I19
sa(dp16021
g2
V(skeptical, into radio) Are you sure about this?
p16022
sg4
I8
sa(dp16023
g2
VWell, let me transfer down to this station. Then at least I can\u2026ooh\u2026well, you're definitely not imagining that.
p16024
sg4
I18
sa(dp16025
g2
VI don't understand it! We always jump to the same relative position in space! Unless\u2026
p16026
sg4
I15
sa(dp16027
g2
VYou said when you went to the future, you saw our sun expanding into a red giant, remember?
p16028
sg4
I18
sa(dp16029
g2
VNo. No-no-no-no-no. But maybe what eventually happens in our reality is happening in this one, only much sooner. Look, we didn't go to the sun, the sun came to us.
p16030
sg4
I30
sa(dp16031
g2
VI-I don't know. I just, I found it interesting.
p16032
sg4
I9
sa(dp16033
g2
VActually, I think our best bet is just to transfer as much power as we can to the shields and ride it out to the next jump.
p16034
sg4
I27
sa(dp16035
g2
VWell, the time the capacitor takes to charge now that I've enacted those new protocols. You know, um\u2026I have no idea.
p16036
sg4
I21
sa(dp16037
g2
V(defensively) I have no idea how long it would take me to fix sub-lights, either! Look, I've got to run a diagnostic, but theoretically, transferring power to the shields should be relatively easy.
p16038
sg4
I33
sa(dp16039
g2
VAll right, the first thing I need you to do is head down to engineering.
p16040
sg4
I15
sa(dp16041
g2
VYou need to kill all power to non-essential decks which means you're gonna have to access the main administrative interface. That should bring up a list of all available override commands.
p16042
sg4
I31
sa(dp16043
g2
VOkay. So choose the command for life support; you're gonna have to designate the decks one by one.
p16044
sg4
I18
sa(dp16045
g2
V(over radio) Dammit. That didn't buy us nearly as much power as I would've thought.
p16046
sg4
I15
sa(dp16047
g2
VRight, um\u2026all right, look, the ship has auxiliary power modules for most of the main systems. Uh, most likely they're depleted, but, uh, if not, well, it might buy us a little more juice.
p16048
sg4
I34
sa(dp16049
g2
V(nervous, over radio) What the hell was that? Was it gunfire?
p16050
sg4
I11
sa(dp16051
g2
V(nervous) All right.
p16052
sg4
I3
sa(dp16053
g2
V(over radio) No-no-no-no-no. It's not enough.
p16054
sg4
I6
sa(dp16055
g2
VWithout sub-lights, our orbit is decaying, which means more radiation slamming into the shields. The alternate reality drive is only charged to seventy percent! Which means it'll never make one hundred before the shields fail!
p16056
sg4
I35
sa(dp16057
g2
V(frustrated) J-J-Just\u2026give me a second.
p16058
sg4
I5
sa(dp16059
g2
VAll right, I got it. I got it! Drop the shields.
p16060
sg4
I11
sa(dp16061
g2
VDrop the shields. I will transfer all available power to the drive. Hopefully, it'll be enough to induce a jump.
p16062
sg4
I20
sa(dp16063
g2
VIt is our only option, and every second we argue about it is less of a chance it's going to work!

g2
V(worried) Uh, you may want to hold off on the congratulations.
p16076
sg4
I11
sa(dp16077
g2
V(over radio) I think I've overtaxed the drive. Look, it's not completely blown, but\u2026we've only got a handful of jumps before it's burned out.
p16078
sg4
I24
sa(dp16079
g2
VIf we haven't found our way back by then, we will be stranded forever.
p16080
sg4
I14
sa(dp16081
g2
VAll right, I think I got something. In fact, it was staring me in the face the whole time, I was too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice it.
p16082
sg4
I31
sa(dp16083
g2
VSee, my mistake was focusing on the navigation system. I should've known that was never going to work.
p16084
sg4
I18
sa(dp16085
g2
VSo, in a spectacular feat of multi-dimensional mathematics, I have discovered a way to send the ship back along the path it's previously traveled, bypassing the navigation system altogether.
p16086
sg4
I29
sa(dp16087
g2
V(pleased) Exactly.
p16088
sg4
I2
sa(dp16089
g2
VAnd naturally, I dismissed it out of hand. But then I realized, that including the original designer, not one, but two versions of myself have failed to make this thing work. I had to think not like me. In fact, I had to think like the opposite of me, and it doesn't get much more opposite than you.
p16090
sg4
I58
sa(dp16091
g2
VWell, not directly. It's impossible to calculate the relative position of our original starting point from where we are now. But we can retrace our steps, passing through each reality in turn until we reach the right one.
p16092
sg4
I38
sa(dp16093
g2
VNot necessarily. Look, we know that the ship carries its momentum in real space from one reality to the next. Now, we may not have sub-light engines, but we do have maneuvering thrusters. You know, one long continuous burn along the right trajectory, from now until the next jump should be enough to allow us to establish a-a higher, more stable orbit around the sun.
p16094
sg4
I65
sa(dp16095
g2
V(reluctantly) Well, I wouldn't go that far, but at least it'll be, uh\u2026not quite as deadly?
p16096
sg4
I16
sa(dp16097
g2
VOkay, that's it. Course is already plotted.
p16098
sg4
I7
sa(dp16099
g2
VWell, I wouldn't count on it. Look, time is passing at the same rate in each of the realities, which means\u2026well, which means it hasn't been that long. To get past those aliens, we're going to need sub-light engines. And I'm going to need to fix them in time.
p16100
sg4
I49
sa(dp16101
g2
VSo, I haven't had a chance to check it out. I'm sorry, I can't do ten things at once. I already told you, the drive is going to burn out. Soon! We have to do something! Who's to say the next reality won't be even worse?
p16102

p16142
sg4

V(panicked) Look, there's no way off!
p16154
sg4
I6
sa(dp16155
g2
VWe broke orbit to get away from the fighters, remember? Look, we carry our momentum and relative position in space from one reality to the next, which means, by the time we next jump, we're gonna be, like, half a million kilometers out. They're never going to get to us in time!
p16156
sg4
I52
sa(dp16157
g2
VThat could work, or it could tear a hole in the space-time continuum, not only killing us, but destroying the entire solar system.

VHalf a dozen, tops. Then it'll be completely inert.
p16160
sg4
I9
sa(dp16161

VActually, you know, I've been thinking about that. Now, true, the navigation system was flawed to start, but, um, the basic principles of the drive are fundamentally sound\u2014
p16162
sg4
I28
sa(dp16163

V(worried) We just lost power.
p16206
sg4
I5
sa(dp16207

VOkay, good. Good! I was wrong. We still have power; it's just not getting to any of the primary systems\u2026or the secondary systems, either.
p16208
sg4
I24
sa(dp16209
g2
VI don't know. It's some kind of interference. I'm getting, uh, spikes all over the place. I mean, it's completely haywire. Thank god the inertial dampeners weren't affected.
p16210
sg4
I28
sa(dp16211
g2
VThat's displacement current. High voltage. Do not let it hit you!
p16212
sg4
I11
sa(dp16213
g2
VThat is doubtful, okay? There was nothing technological, I mean, Ancient or other on that planet. It was totally primordial. I didn't detect anything unusual in the planet's magnetosphere. Look, it-it's got to be some kind of a-of a glitch in the jumper's capacitors. Just give me a second, I'll figure out how to\u2026Oh, no.
p16214

I55
sa(dp16215

p16216

I26
sa(dp16217
g2
VWell, I-I'll try but the radio communications were affected as well.
p16218

p16222

p16224

VThat\u2026was the good news. The bad news, is we lost life support.
p16226
sg4
I12

p16262

g2
V(snappish) Yes, remarkably not unlike it.
p16264
sg4
I6
sa(dp16265

p16266

g2
V(astonished) What?!
p16274
sg4
I2
sa(dp16275
g2
VNo, no, no. I disabled the jumper's network connection for this very reason. There is no way the anomaly jumped to the city's systems!
p16276
sg4
I24

g2
VWe've got power disruptions all over the city. Nearly every system's affected.
p16278
sg4
I12

g2
V(more cautious) It's one of several possibilities we're looking into.
p16280
sg4
I10
sa(dp16281
g2
VIt's a possibility, all right? The point is, we have no idea what's going on here.
p16282
sg4
I16
sa(dp16283
g2
VLook, the energy builds up in one area, and then discharges in a-in a high-voltage displacement current. Very erratic. Very lethal.
p16284
sg4
I21
sa(dp16285
g2
V(impatient) Look, don't worry, all right? I will figure it out. I just gotta\u2026run a few diagnostics, narrow down things\u2026
p16286

g2
V(startled) Hey. The laptop just booted up.
p16288

g2
VOkay\u2026fingers crossed.
p16300
sg4
I2
sa(dp16301
g2
VWell, whatever this entity is, it's completely overwhelming the city's systems. It-it's spread out, like, uh, dozens of fragmented programs that are fouling up power management, communications, you name it. Now, I've managed to merge them, to, uh, patch them together into one incredibly large program that will A) hopefully render our systems slightly more stable, and, uh, B) allow us to better communicate with whoever or\u2026 whatever it is that's claiming to be Doctor Weir.
p16302
sg4
I76
sa(dp16303
g2
VWell, hell yeah. But it's no more dangerous than allowing this thing to continue wreaking havoc on the city's systems.
p16304
sg4
I20
sa(dp16305
g2
VOkay, so, let me see if I can synthesize a voice to communicate with. Elizabeth\u2014if I make the proper calibrations\u2014she should be able to hear us too.

sa(dp16325
g2
VReally? In-in this galaxy?
p16326
sg4
I4
sa(dp16327

VWhich is why you came here. You knew that Atlantis's computers were big enough and powerful enough to house your entire program.
p16328
sg4
I22
sa(dp16329
g2
VBut what if it is her? Look, we still have the Ancient machine I used to build Fran. I can easily build another Replicator to house\u2014
p16330
sg4
I26
sa(dp16331

p16332
sg4
I24
sa(dp16333
g2
VWell, she can't stay where she is. She's frying the city's computers.
p16334

p16346
sg4

p16350

p16354
sg4
I21
sa(dp16355
g2
VOh, I'm just saying that if we keep her under constant guard, it'll minimize any threat she poses\u2014if she even poses a threat. And it'll give us more time to study her.
p16356
sg4

p16358

V(upset) What if it is Doctor Weir? Look, this is my fault. I'm the one who reactivated the nanites in Elizabeth. True, to save her, but\u2026look, I'm the one who created this mess. I think I should be the one to, you know, fix it. I owe it to Elizabeth.

VA firewall won't work; you can't block them. They just pop in and out of subspace. They're here, they're there. It's impossible to predict. (inspired) \u2026I could write program that immediately quarantines any anomalous behavior in the system, like an anti-virus software. It's going to take some time though.

VWait a second, um, building humans\u2026that's going to take time, isn't it? I mean, first you have to create the technology to do it. We're talking nanites\u2026I mean, organically assembling each body inside out, starting at the molecular level. Well, then, you have to create the machine to transfer the consciousness. That's going to take god knows how long!

I25

VIt fits. The Ancients don't put Stargates on a flood plain, and I certainly don't think the tide just came in. It explains why the water's so\u2026freezing. (sneezing) Oh. Aw. Okay. Okay, so now I'm hot and I'm still shivering.

V(caustically) You said "hmm"?
p16668

I4
sa(dp16669
g2
VOr a superheavy element the Ancients used to use as an energy source. I've never seen it before.
p16670
sg4
I18
sa(dp16671
g2
VWell, who could tell what that is? It must be thousands of years since\u2014
p16672
sg4
I14
sa(dp16673
g2
VWhoa! See that spike?
p16674
sg4
I4
sa(dp16675
g2
VHey, for me, this is fun! Just\u2026save me some ham. Whoa, there it goes again. It's like some kind intermittent gamma that's\u2014
p16676
sg4
I22
sa(dp16677
g2
VWhat? Why?
p16678
sg4
I2
sa(dp16679
g2
VWhere are we going?
p16680
sg4
I4
sa(dp16681
g2
VAbsolutely not!
p16682
sg4
I2
sa(dp16683
g2
VLook, my brain is not some new deck off the back of your house!
p16684
sg4
I14
sa(dp16685
g2
V(spinning to Keller) Yeah, and as my parting advice, you need to stop letting these guys talk you into doing stupid things!
p16686
sg4
I22
sa(dp16687
g2
VReally?
p16688
sg4
I1
sa(dp16689
g2
V(petulant) Yeah, with my help\u2026
p16690
sg4
I5
sa(dp16691
g2
VLook, this isn't one of those\u2026PBS brain surgeries where my\u2026skull is wide open and we're having a conversation?
p16692
sg4
I18
sa(dp16693
g2
VYeah, it's probably a hammer.
p16694
sg4
I5
sa(dp16695
g2
VLook, obviously I'd get around to consenting. It's just you\u2026you've thrown an awful lot at me all at once.
p16696
sg4
I19
sa(dp16697
g2
VAll right, well let me have a little ham. We'll uh\u2026

g2
V(voice slurred) Bye, Jeannie. Sorry I was mean sometimes.
p16700
sg4

sa(dp16701
g2
VBye. Bye, Teyla. Bye, Ronon Dex.
p16702

I6
sa(dp16703

VBye, John.
p16704

sa(dp16707
g2
V(groggily) Who can sleep with all the talking?
p16708
sg4
I8
sa(dp16709
g2
VHi.
p16710
sg4
I1
sa(dp16711
g2
VWell, there was so much to spare.
p16712
sg4
I7
sa(dp16713
g2
V(to Keller) Thank you.
p16714
sg4
I4
sa(dp16715
g2
VThat was scary.
p16716

sa(dp16717
g2
V(brightening slightly) Peckish.
p16718
sg4
I3
sa(dp16719
g2
V(looking towards Keller) Jennifer, there's s-something I wanted to, um\u2026while I remember. While I still can. Something I wanted to say before uh\u2026
p16720
sg4
I23
sa(dp16721
g2
VI, uh\u2026I love you.
p16722
sg4
I4
sa(dp16723
g2
V(on video) I've loved you for some time now. Okay, where was I?
p16724
sg4
I13
sa(dp16725
g2
VI can't believe you're leaving. I mean, you know, you're sick, we cure you, you go away for six months to recover, you finally come back and now, what, you're here a week, you're leaving again?
p16726
sg4
I36
sa(dp16727
g2
VWhat? Of course it is. What are you, kidding me?
p16728
sg4
I10
sa(dp16729
g2
VC'mon, you cannot blame yourself, all right? Look, Michael forced you to help him. He was the one disseminating the drug.
p16730
sg4
I21
sa(dp16731
g2
VCan't believe you're leaving already. You've been here, like, less than two weeks.
p16732
sg4
I13
sa(dp16733
g2
VWho?
p16734
sg4
I1
sa(dp16735
g2
VWho's Porter?
p16736
sg4
I2
sa(dp16737
g2
VFine, you know what? I don't even want to know! Don't tell me!
p16738
sg4
I13
sa(dp16739
g2
VOkay, come on, tell me!
p16740
sg4
I5
sa(dp16741
g2
VI still say we should've brought backup. Another jumper or a marine unit, something.
p16742
sg4
I14
sa(dp16743
g2
VWell, a strong one, hopefully.
p16744
sg4
I5
sa(dp16745
g2
VEasier said than done.
p16746
sg4
I4
sa(dp16747
g2
V(absently) Well, you never forget your first.
p16748
sg4
I7
sa(dp16749
g2
VApparently. We're receiving a transmission.
p16750
sg4
I5
sa(dp16751
g2
V(sarcastic) What, no "hello, greetings, weary travelers?"
p16752
sg4
I7
sa(dp16753
g2
VWell, if history has taught us anything, this is the part where we get double-crossed and taken prisoner.
p16754
sg4
I18
sa(dp16755
g2
V(grumbling) And that makes a difference?
p16756
sg4
I6
sa(dp16757
g2
VWell, let's not forget that Michael spread the modified Hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more. I mean, no one knows for sure, right? Which means that every time you feed? You're taking a risk.
p16758
sg4
I36
sa(dp16759
g2
VI don't know, from where I was sitting, things seemed to go pretty well.
p16760
sg4
I14
sa(dp16761
g2
VWe've been trying to do that for four years. They're still here!
p16762
sg4
I12
sa(dp16763
g2
VWait a minute. I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.
p16764
sg4
I13
sa(dp16765
g2
VThe uber-queen?
p16766
sg4
I2
sa(dp16767
g2
VWhen are we going to get to see her?
p16768
sg4
I9
sa(dp16769
g2
VI can't. I've had, like, three cups of coffee. I'm completely wired.
p16770
sg4
I12
sa(dp16771
g2
VHow long is this going to take anyway?
p16772
sg4
I8
sa(dp16773
g2
VShe's already too convincing if you ask me. Creeps me out.
p16774
sg4
I11
sa(dp16775
g2
VSo, what's the plan?
p16776
sg4
I4
sa(dp16777
g2
VOh, your proposal?
p16778
sg4
I3
sa(dp16779
g2
VWell, we'll be right here. If anything goes wrong\u2026 (clicks his tongue) \u2026we'll get you out.
p16780
sg4
I16
sa(dp16781
g2
VWell, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does\u2026
p16782
sg4
I11
sa(dp16783
g2
V(meekly) Which it won't.
p16784
sg4
I4
sa(dp16785
g2
VWhat?!
p16786
sg4
I1
sa(dp16787
g2
VUh, Ronon?
p16788
sg4
I2
sa(dp16789
g2
VWho?
p16790
sg4
I1
sa(dp16791
g2
VWell, since when did we start calling him that?
p16792
sg4
I9
sa(dp16793
g2
VSeriously, the next time we have to name one of these guys, we should take a vote.
p16794
sg4
I17
sa(dp16795
g2
VWe can't stay here, we're stuck on a hive, surrounded by Wraith. Not exactly our strongest position.
p16796
sg4
I17
sa(dp16797
g2
VWell, we get to a 'gate, we gate back to Atlantis, and then we\u2026figure out where they took Teyla.
p16798
sg4
I19
sa(dp16799
g2
V(weakly) Okay, so I haven't quite worked out the details yet. But, uh\u2026
p16800
sg4
I13
sa(dp16801
g2
VIt's Todd's subspace transmitter.
p16802
sg4
I4
sa(dp16803
g2
VWell, what are they doing out there?
p16804
sg4
I7
sa(dp16805
g2
VSo what, uh\u2026what kind of a diversion?
p16806
sg4
I7
sa(dp16807
g2
VWhat are you talking about? What-what order? Oh, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, you're-you're not thinking about attacking the other ship?
p16808
sg4
I23
sa(dp16809
g2
VBut it's also incredibly risky. Look, I mean, either of these ships could be destroyed!
p16810
sg4
I15
sa(dp16811
g2
VWhat else can we do? We go after them.
p16812
sg4
I9
sa(dp16813
g2
VPretty much. Todd's locator beacon doesn't work in hyperspace.
p16814
sg4
I9
sa(dp16815
g2
VAll right, we should be coming up on them\u2026now. Wait a minute\u2026there's two of them.
p16816
sg4
I15
sa(dp16817
g2
V(puzzled) And they're fighting! They're not pulling any punches either.
p16818
sg4
I10
sa(dp16819
g2
VUh\u2026yeah.
p16820
sg4
I1
sa(dp16821
g2
VAll right, it's that one. They're not doing so good.
p16822
sg4
I10
sa(dp16823
g2
VThey must've lost some of their weapons. I mean, they're seriously outgunned.
p16824
sg4
I12
sa(dp16825
g2
VYou know, just last week I was talking to Zelenka about trying to reverse-engineer a Daedalus beaming system for the jumpers?
p16826
sg4
I21
sa(dp16827
g2
VOh, well, no, we're nowhere near close. I mean, the Asgard technology's incredibly complicated\u2014
p16828
sg4
I14
sa(dp16829
g2
VI'm just saying that this would be the perfect situation for\u2026something like this.
p16830
sg4
I13
sa(dp16831
g2
VWhat are you doing?
p16832
sg4
I4
sa(dp16833
g2
VAre you nuts?! They can see us!
p16834
sg4
I7
sa(dp16835
g2
VDarts are heading back. Bay doors are open.
p16836
sg4
I8
sa(dp16837
g2
VI don't know.
p16838
sg4
I3
sa(dp16839
g2
VIt's hard to tell. I think we're on the wrong level\u2026plus, the signal keeps moving around.
p16840
sg4
I16
sa(dp16841
g2
VAll right. It's this way\u2026I think.
p16842
sg4
I6
sa(dp16843
g2
V(whispering) Oh, great. I gotta figure this out all over again?
p16844
sg4
I11
sa(dp16845
g2
VSo what are we gonna do?
p16846
sg4
I6
sa(dp16847
g2
VOh\u2026
p16848
sg4
I1
sa(dp16849
g2
VNow what?
p16850
sg4
I2
sa(dp16851
g2
V(flatly) Very reassuring.
p16852
sg4
I3
sa(dp16853
g2
VIt's Teyla. She's alive.
p16854
sg4
I4
sa(dp16855
g2
VWait\u2026what?!
p16856
sg4
I1
sa(dp16857
g2
V(reciting as memory exercise) Neuraminidase inhibitor. Neuraminidase inhibitor. Neuraminidase inhibitor.
p16858
sg4
I10
sa(dp16859
g2
V(guiltily) Hey.
p16860
sg4
I2
sa(dp16861
g2
VI'm, uh, assisting with a, uh, medical follow-up on M33-985, yes.
p16862
sg4
I11
sa(dp16863
g2
VRight again.
p16864
sg4
I2
sa(dp16865
g2
VWhat, I can't go off-world in my free time?
p16866
sg4
I9
sa(dp16867
g2
VWell, I'm turning over a new leaf. It's a whole new, uh, you know, kinder, gentler Rodney McKay.
p16868
sg4
I18
sa(dp16869
g2
V(with false brightness, to Ronon) You\u2026coming too, are you?
p16870
sg4
I9
sa(dp16871
g2
VHmm.
p16872
sg4
I1
sa(dp16873
g2
VNo, no, no, just, I was\u2014I was just\u2026no, it's nothing.
p16874
sg4
I10
sa(dp16875
g2
VRight. I got this. I'm good. I got it. I got it. I'm good.
p16876
sg4
I14
sa(dp16877
g2
VYou want it? You-you take that.. I got\u2026my own stuff, that I'll bring.
p16878
sg4
I13
sa(dp16879
g2
V(casually) Oh, a, uh, neuraminidase inhibitor?
p16880

V(stammering) Oh\u2026you want to\u2026sure.
p16882
sg4
I4
sa(dp16883
g2
VOddly enough, I don't, actually. But, if you need to get back, then um\u2026
p16884
sg4
I14
sa(dp16885
g2
VOf course you are.
p16886
sg4
I4
sa(dp16887
g2
V(nervously) You think we've given them enough time? I mean, I don't want to interrupt if they're in the middle of medical\u2026
p16888
sg4
I22
sa(dp16889
g2
V\u2026stuff.
p16890

g2
VHi. Um\u2026is Doctor Keller done?
p16892
sg4

VOh right. Very good. Thanks.

p16898
sg4
I9
sa(dp16899
g2
V(into radio) Doctor Keller, please respond! (to Ronon) Well, either her radio isn't working or she's turned it off.
p16900
sg4
I19
sa(dp16901
g2
V(worried) Then what happened to her?
p16902
sg4
I6
sa(dp16903
g2
VAnything?
p16904
sg4
I1
sa(dp16905
g2
VThat doesn't make any sense. I mean, she wouldn't take off without telling us where she's going.
p16906
sg4
I17
sa(dp16907
g2
VMaybe you're right.
p16908
sg4

p16918
sg4
I3
sa(dp16919
g2
VSo what happened to Keller's?
p16920
sg4
I5
sa(dp16921
g2
V(sighing) Oh, god.
p16922
sg4
I3
sa(dp16923
g2
VMaybe we should wait. All right, I'm almost to the 'gate. I-I-I'll radio ahead, get a-a team here. Do a proper search.
p16924
sg4
I22
sa(dp16925
g2
VYeah, I'm here.
p16926
sg4
I3
sa(dp16927
g2
VOh, great! That's great! All right, I'm at the 'gate. I'll get the search teams mobilized, join you shortly.
p16928

VOh, crap!

sg4
I2
sa(dp16931
g2
V(into radio) Ronon!
p16932
sg4
I3
sa(dp16933
g2
VWe got Wraith!
p16934
sg4
I3
sa(dp16935
g2
VFour of them just came through the 'gate, and one of them's about to kill me!
p16936

p16938

VOh!
p16940
sg4
I1
sa(dp16941
g2
V(breathless and relieved) Oh, finally! Oh\u2026what took you so long!?
p16942
sg4
I10
sa(dp16943
g2
VWhat?
p16944
sg4
I1
sa(dp16945
g2
VI thought runners were extremely rare, like, only a few in the galaxy!
p16946
sg4
I13
sa(dp16947
g2
VYeah, so a few years we run into you, and now another one? I mean wha-what are the odds of that?
p16948
sg4
I21
sa(dp16949
g2
VI don't know. They-they spread out into the forest.
p16950
sg4
I9
sa(dp16951
g2
VWhere are you go\u2014? Where are you going? Hey wait!
p16952
sg4
I10
sa(dp16953
g2
V(out of breath) Hopefully not. It's just a few of them. We think they're looking for someone else.
p16954
sg4
I18
sa(dp16955
g2
VLook, have you seen anyone different in the village recently? Any-any newcomers? Anyone that looks\u2026uh\u2026uh\u2026like that?
p16956
sg4
I16

VThat's it. That's it. Mind your step, sir.
p16958

sa(dp16963
g2
VOr me!
p16964
sg4
I2
sa(dp16965
g2
V(to Ronon) Hey, maybe we should go back to the 'gate?
p16966
sg4
I11
sa(dp16967
g2
VWha\u2014I do not think it is wise for us to split up right now. We have no idea where the Wraith are.
p16968
sg4
I22
sa(dp16969

VRonon? Ronon! I\u2014oh, dammit! Would you just\u2026Ronon!

g2
VHey! If you\u2014 (sees Ronon concentrating) What?
p16972
sg4
I7
sa(dp16973
g2
VThe runner.
p16974
sg4
I2
sa(dp16975
g2
VWell, at least the tracks are clear, though. Easier to follow, right?
p16976
sg4
I12
sa(dp16977
g2
VActually, we have two hours, forty-three minutes, and seventeen seconds. This planet's sun currently has a very gradual angle of descent and a very short night. I always make it a point to download the planetary data on every address I dial, even goodwill missions. You know, things like, uh, atmospheric conditions, soil consistencies, available water supplies. What?
p16978
sg4
I58
sa(dp16979
g2
VOh, you know, I think you'd be surprised, you know? I mean I may not be exactly what you would call an "outdoors person", but that doesn't mean I don't [sic] find the whole "man versus nature" thing uninteresting. Hell, I joined a scouting organization when I was a child. Lodge 14 of the Fort McMurray Eager Beavers.
p16980
sg4
I58
sa(dp16981
g2
VYep. Large rodent. Big teeth. Uses them to chop down trees and build dams. Very industrious. I was with them for a few months before they asked me to leave, but, uh, I got the manual. Still have it\u2014Scouting for Beavers. Invaluable resource. So, I think you'll find in a pinch, I handle myself very well, thank you very\u2014

VYeah, I know. But maybe he's carrying her again. Or maybe they were attacked by the Wraith. Jennifer was stunned\u2026and then the runner kills the Wraith and disposes the body\u2026and then carries Jennifer on up the trail. Look how deep these tracks are. I say we follow these.

V\u2026Thanks to this handy gadget!

VI'm sorry, but I guarantee, at some point, you're going to need my help. You'll see. There'll be some problem you can't solve. Then you'll turn to me. I'll figure it out in the nick of time, you'll say "good job," or just grunt, or slap me on the back harder than necessary. Anyways, the point is\u2026we both have our gifts. So you need to stop resenting my presence here, and start realizing we're on the same team, both trying to achieve the same goal. All right? Are you listening? You got the tracker face. Can you hear what I'm saying here?

VWell, he's dead ahead. So either he climbed this thing, or he figured out how to get around it.
p17004

sa(dp17005

VWell, so they must've had a rope or something, unlike us. Look, how are we going to get up there?

VOkay, nightfall, seventeen minutes. But like I said, it's very brief. Like, uh, Whitehorse in June. Oh, not that you have any idea what Whitehorse is\u2026or June for that matter\u2026

p17034

VSo the Wraith got to them before we did?
p17036

sa(dp17037

VWell, so what happened? What, they killed each other?
p17038
sg4

sa(dp17039

VAh, so she killed him. Probably in the process of disabling his tracking device.
p17040

sa(dp17041

V(dubious) So, what, she brought him here unconscious, revived him, and they left together?

sa(dp17043

VHey, wait a second. You said there were two bodies. So what, she took a nap?

p17080

sa(dp17081

VI don't know about "fixed", it's more of a "patch" really. It's incredibly complicated technology. I'm not sure if it'll actually\u2014

sa(dp17085

VLook, just-just-just, wait a second. All right? Look, I'm not sure if I've actually fixed it. You'll need to test it before you actually.

p17092

VI'm not going to fight you for her, if that's what you're thinking.

VI'm not going to step aside either! So\u2026we're just going to have to\u2026let her decide.
