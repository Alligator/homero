<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Excerpts from 2.18 "Michael" and 2.20 "Allies Part 1" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>END EXCERPTS</b>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> is under attack by two hive ships, its shields taking most of the energy.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell is in command. Sheppard stands beside between him and Marks, hanging onto their chairs as the ship rocks from the blasts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
With some 302s, we might be able to take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Shields are at sixty percent!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Four F-302s launch from the hangar bay of <i>Daedalus</i>. The pilots speak to each other over their radios.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
I've got incoming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dagger 3 and 4, let's try to keep these darts off our six.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
Roger that.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard moves forward and fires on one of the Hive ships. After a moment, many darts come out to face them, then split up to follow each pair of 302s. As each speak, they are shown in their cockpits.]
</p>
<blockquote>ANDERS<br />
Half the bogies are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4. We've got the other half hot on our tail.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
I'm taking fire. I've lost the generator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stand by to break left on my mark. Mark! Fox Four.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's ship fires two missiles at one of the Hives. They explode amidst the swarm of Darts, destroying many.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're in the clear. Continue to target.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Shields are under twenty percent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship. We need to jump out of here as soon as possible.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's F-302 moves in very fast, very close to the Hive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Unless you can shut down their weapons, it's not going to do us much good.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;F-302 COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sees two boggies move around behind his ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Damn it. Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run to the target hyperdrive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
Roger that, leader. I'm on my way.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[She takes out the two boggies. She and Sheppard speak over the radios.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
The remaining darts are returning to the hives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you go to max thrust?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
Negative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Head back to the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
Roger that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Both Hives enter hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell gets up and approaches the forward viewscreen.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Why the hell'd they do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Three of our 302s are returning to <i>Daedalus</i>, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
His fighter isn't one of them. The only contacts I have on screen are wreckage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What about his locator beacon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Nothing, sir. He's just gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;F-302 COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard removes his air mask and looks upward through his window.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. This is new.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's F-302 is attached to the top of one of the Hives as it speeds through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell climbs the stairs to the control room, where he meets Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel Caldwell. What's the status of the repairs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Ongoing. We lost a few key personnel in the attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them. I've just briefed General Landry. We're to check in in an hour and advise him of our response to this.</blockquote>
<p>[The walk to Weir's office, Zelenka and Teyla following.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I've got a broken ship and serious casualties. I don't know what sort of response you have in mind, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I want you to redeploy immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
As long as they're still in striking distance, we have to at least try.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Radek?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives using the information they were able to steal from our database. The <i>Aurora</i> mission reports&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Obviously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
However, their ships are organic in nature. They will need to make brief pauses to recover from the effects of hyperspace radiation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Where and when?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Uh, yeah, uh, it will take some time to calculate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Look, Dr. Weir, I want to go after these bastards as much as you do, but the <i>Daedalus</i> is in no position to fight right now. Our shields are severely depleted. Several decks are inaccessible. Even if we could catch up with them, I don't know how long we'd last.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Which is why I'm committing the <i>Orion</i> as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It was recalled the moment the Wraith computer virus was revealed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
And it's in no better shape than <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It will fly, and by the time you reach the hive ships, it should also be able to fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
And if it isn't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth. They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You know what you're asking me to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
There's still repairs that need to be made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do what you have to do.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. Weir and Teyla exchange concerned looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;HYPERSPACE</b>
</p><p>[The two Hives move through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay are trapped beside each other inside Wraith pods, stored there as future food. McKay's face is partially protruding from the webbing. Ronon is pushing hard on the webbing of his pod.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They couldn't have. Even if they somehow deduced the location of Earth, they still wouldn't be able to get there, not unless they&#8230; They downloaded something along with the hive ship plans, something like spyware. It's like when I stupidly downloaded por&#8212;Music. When I downloaded music. I asked them to do it. I did this. I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If anybody was going to do it, it'd be you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you. Thank you so much for that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Stop worrying about it now. Just focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Focus on what? What is there to focus on? I'm stuck in a cocoon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Getting out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, right. Of course. Now, why didn't I think of that? Of course. Here goes. Um, nope. Still can't move. I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof, there, big guy.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;HYPERSPACE</b>
</p><p>[The two Hives move through hyperspace. Sheppard's F302 sits on a surface on the underside of one. His ship is tiny compared to the Hive, merely a speck on the hull.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;F303 COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, can't sit here forever.</blockquote>
<p>[He brings up a control panel that asks if he wants to disengage docking clamps. He hesitates.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hit them while they're in hyperspace. They'll never know what happened. Is that even possible?</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CAFETERIA</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka argue as Sheppard eats and looks between them at an attractive female crew-member.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There is no reason to believe that their hyperspace field is any different from ours, and we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus while in hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, I'm simply talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it. What do you think?</blockquote>
<p>[The woman smiles back at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm? What? Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's not listening.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;F303 COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've got to pay more attention to those guys.</blockquote>
<p>[He pushes the "no" selection on releasing the docking clamps.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Michael approaches the Queen of the Hive.]
</p>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
Yes, Michael?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
You should have told me that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
Are you feeling sympathy for them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
No. But I don't understand why I wasn't told. I told you of their plan because I believed it was a viable way of&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful. But I fear, Michael that the lingering stench of what they've transformed you into will never fade.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael hisses at her, then turns and walks away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The gate is active. Weir speaks to Landry over a video link.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace
(showing a map)<br />
here. It's just outside of the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir speaks into a laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There they will pause for 15 hours. If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule, they should be able to reach those coordinates in just under fourteen hours, best possible speed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Narrow window.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's the only window, sir.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between the two control rooms.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Understood. Now, the International Oversight Advisory want you to brief them on this matter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
When would you like me to dial in again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
You misunderstand me. I mean in person, and I mean right now. The president himself assigned&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I can't just leave, not now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I'm afraid that's not up to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There is far too much going on here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Doctor&#8230; You've done all you're going to do for now. I need you to step through that gate. They're waiting for you in my briefing room&#8230; Dr. Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<p>[She signs off and stands up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(upset)<br />
Teyla&#8230;we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions. Once that happens, I'd like to suspend all gate travel till this whole thing is over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And I'll need you to dial in once the <i>Daedalus</i> is ready to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know what to do, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of course you do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will see you when you return.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sits in Weir's chair. Weir walks down to the gate room and through the active wormhole, carrying only a laptop.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE</b>
</p><p>[The travel is much longer than an intra-galaxy trip.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir walks through. Landry awaits her at the bottom of the ramp. The walk and talk, making their way down the corridor and up to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Welcome back to Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you, general.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's wonderful to be here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I can see that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You know, I considered disobeying your order. There wouldn't have been too much you could do about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
You made the right decision in coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We're in the middle of a crisis, General. This is absolutely&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Don't bite my head off, Elizabeth. The recall order didn't come from me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Who it came from doesn't matter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
What if I told you it came from the President?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I wouldn't believe you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
And you'd be right. But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race. The President had no choice but to accede to the I.O.A.'s demand that you be brought back to explain yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(looking up toward briefing room)<br />
So, what do they really want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
To point fingers, cover their asses&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
They're bureaucrats, Elizabeth. You'll have them for breakfast.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;HYPERSPACE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Michael walks down a corridor. Two Wraith drones step in front of him and block his path.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
There is work I must attend to&#8230; Stand aside&#8230; Am I to sit quietly in my quarters?</blockquote>
<p>[They ignore him. He hisses at them strongly, then walks back the way he came.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH HIVE SHIP POD SECTION</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, these things are actually quite comfortable. Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine&#8230; I suppose they're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity as we know it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're wasting your energy talking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out? Then what, huh? We're still on a hive, we're still traveling through hyperspace, probably in the massive void between our two galaxies&#8230;where there aren't even planets, let alone Stargates. What then, huh? Do we fly home on the wings of imagination? Is that what we do, Ronon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You can sit here and die if you like, but I'm not giving up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, fine. I will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Fine!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Hives exit hyperspace and come to a stop in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;F302 COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Time to do some damage. Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB ABOARD HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Michael has Ronon and Rodney's gear, including their radios, which come to life with Sheppard's voice.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney? I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond. If you're near a radio, I need you to come in. I need to know your location. Guys?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Colonel Sheppard? Is that you?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard's F302 and Michael's lab.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who's this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
You know me as Michael.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry&#8230;I got the wrong number.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Ronon and Dr. McKay are still alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you going to do with them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
If you want them to live, listen to me&#8230; If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships in order for them to reach us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If you really want to help, why don't you just do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
They would know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Aren't you "they"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, I don't know. I was pretty deceived.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
It seems, Colonel, that because of what you did to me&#8230;the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(falsely sympathetic)<br />
Oh, that's why you want to help, because you don't feel welcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
We don't have time to discuss this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure we do. I've got a&#8230;good three hours of air left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, wouldn't you like to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I need to know what level you are on so I can guide you from there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean, trust you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Are you in a position not to?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh&#8230;I've got you right where I want you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer&#8230;and yet I very much want to continue living. If you want to survive as I do, then I suggest you tell me where you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship. You still want to help?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive generators would be most effective.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(confused)<br />
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN COMPLEX, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[An array of familiar IOA officials sit opposite Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint. To speed up the problem solving, we distributed the file&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
And played right into their hands.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
And we supported her recommendations, I know&#8230; but clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
So, what measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I was coordinating a strike against the hive ships when you recalled me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRITISH IOA REP<br />
With what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
With everything we've got.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Is that wise?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori, the weapons platform in Antarctica, powered by a pair of Mark II generators, would be Earth's only defense. Now, I believe it would be far better to stop them while they're still within reach of Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on the <i>Daedalus</i> ensuring successful operation of the Antarctic weapons platform when the Wraith arrive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The <i>Daedalus</i> suffered severe damage during the first battle. A long journey at full power was out of the question. And there is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
You would risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake?</blockquote>

Meaning that in a little under nine hours, we're all going to suffocate.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and McKay walk with Kleinman.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
As l&#8212;As long as we don't have to worry about shields and weapons, we may be able to cannibalize parts from some of our other systems, in order to create, at the very least, a-a CO2 filtration system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
By the time we got something like that up and running, the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we'd be able to concoct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
But, it's worth a try.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yeah, but regardless, we need more electricians and welders than are technically certified on the ship's roster. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
There are teams assembling on every deck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good, good.</blockquote>
<p>[The arrive at a supply room and see sets of personal survival packs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, now we're talking. How many more of these do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Twenty in total.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How many people on board?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
In and around the two hundred mark.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, so, I guess buddy-breathing our way through this one's out of the question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
I'm afraid so, sir, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, fine they're reserved for people working on getting life-support systems operational. We need those people as clear-headed as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
And by "those people"&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I will be one of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
How many levels are inaccessible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Seven.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay, we need to find out if there are any pockets of breathable atmosphere in there. We may be able to squeeze another hour or so out of regions that have been sealed off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can't exactly transfer the Oh-two where we need it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but we could be&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We will be able to access key panels that have been closed off to us. Let's get Sheppard in a 302. He can eyeball it from the outside. I'll take this.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes one of the packs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard flies an F302 around the ship, shining a light on it to see the damage and atmosphere escaping from many places.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;F302 COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
These sections are completely open to space Rodney. There aren't even pockets you could beam into. What about an E.V.A.?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> POWER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Rodney works on panels filled with crystals.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The space suits were stored in those sections.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
All right. I'm heading back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Copy that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Have you tried routing the power through the initial&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes, yes. We have tried everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Subspace communications?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shakily)<br />
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek. Atlantis has no ship to send, and even if we were somehow able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth, it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I wasn't thinking of rescue. I was thinking simply of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith, and perhaps letting someone know the sacrifice that we've done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.<br />
(inspired)<br />
Wait a second.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay speaks to Caldwell, Michael and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The only breathable air within light years is on the Wraith ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
There're also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So we take them. Beam an assault team in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
You would be far out-numbered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we're dead here. I'll take my chances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I admire your courage, Colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here&#8230; Unless we send over the gas.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes, yes. That could work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do we still have it on board?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Yes, we do. And now that Michael's disabled their jamming codes&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We finish the plan we started.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We beam over the gas and wait. We wait long enough, they won't even want to put up a fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because they'll be humans with no memories. I can't believe I might actually survive this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We're almost out of breathable air now, and the retrovirus takes a minimum ten hours to run its course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the 302s. 
(to Michael)<br />
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I could.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you say, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEAPONS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Landry knocks on the doorway of Weir's SGC office. The door is open.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(concerned)<br />
Anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
No. No contacts yet. Our tests of the Mark Two generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
"Promising." That doesn't sound very promising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Yeah, we're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships, but doing so will probably require the last of our drones, and there goes our secret weapon. We'd really rather not have to do that. How'd it go with the I.O.A.?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh, you know. I mean does anyone ever come out of an I.O.A. deposition saying, "That went well"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
No, I don't suppose they do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It was what it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Well, at least most of the time you're a galaxy away. That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.</blockquote>
<p>[Landry sits across from Weird.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think they're going to ask me to step down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Well, if they're just going to ask, you can always say no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I messed this one up, General.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Yeah, you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And I lost some of the best people I've ever&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
But you proceeded with the blessing of the I.O.A and Stargate Command, as I recall.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
"Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It's the courage to continue that counts." And I think you've got that in spades.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Churchill?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Yeah except for that last part about you. That was all me. Get some sleep, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Landry leaves, and Weir contemplates his words.]

It's all right.<br />

Hello? You all right?</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
It's okay. You're going to be all right now.</blockquote>
<p>[The Queen, still a Wraith, grabs Lorne at the throat and lifts him off the deck. She yells and prepares to feed on him. McKay and the others shoot her, and she drops Lorne on the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
It didn't work on her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.</blockquote>

Yeah. Something you might have mentioned before she almost killed me,
Rodney.</blockquote>

I only thought of it now.</blockquote>

Go ahead.</blockquote>
