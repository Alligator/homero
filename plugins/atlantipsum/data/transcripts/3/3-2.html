<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[Scenes from SGA 2.20 "Allies Part 1" and SGA 3.01 "No Man's Land Part 2" are shown.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir waits anxiously in the busy control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Incoming wormhole.<br />
(to Weir)<br />
Opening the iris. Receiving video transmission.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla appears on a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over transmission)<br />
Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm here, Teyla. Any word about our people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over comm)<br />
Unfortunately&#8230;no. But the hive ship we have been tracking is still on course for Atlantis. We expect its arrival shortly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into comm)<br />
Activate the cloak.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to Chuck)<br />
Proceed.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Atlantis disappears from view.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Cloak is engaged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over comm)<br />
What about our defenses?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into comm)<br />
All rail gun positions are manned and operational, and Doctor Beckett is in the drone control chair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over comm, nodding)<br />
Patch me through to him.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[A tense Beckett sits in the active chair. Several personnel are around.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over comm)<br />
Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(nervously)<br />
Elizabeth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over comm)<br />
How are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh just peachy, thanks. You?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between Weir's and Beckett's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sorry to put you in this position, but you're the only person besides Colonel Sheppard and General O'Neill who've actually fired a drone from that chair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ironically, they're the two people I nearly killed when I did that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You'll do fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Is this even necessary? I mean, we've got the cloak up. Chances are, they won't find us and they'll just be on their way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Normally, I would agree with you, but this ship is moving much faster than we've ever seen a hive ship move before, which means either it's one of the ships the <i>Daedalus</i> is chasing, or they shared the information they stole from us with other Wraith. Either way, the cloak might not do us much good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith ships jumps out of hyperspace and moves toward the Atlantis planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Hive ship just jumped out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor Beckett, stand by.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett gulps and waits.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Harriman listen intently for news.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everyone nervously watches.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Receiving a signal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over comm)<br />
Atlantis, this is Sheppard. Come in.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone breathes a suprised sigh of relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over comm)<br />
They made it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over comm)<br />
We're out of food, water, and we haven't slept in days, but, yeah we made it. So&#8230;now would not be a good time to fire on us.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[A smug Sheppard and McKay are on the bridge. Michael works the controls behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
After all, we wouldn't want to damage our new hive ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> undocks from within the hive ship and flies down to the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Beckett walk through the corridor. Sheppard moves confidently, Beckett looks shocked.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over comm)<br />
This is <i>Daedalus</i>. We're clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comm)<br />
Understood.<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Sorry to sneak up on you like that, Doc. Subspace communications were down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I came this close to blasting you out of the sky!</blockquote>
<p>[He holds his index finger and thumb very close together.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You showed remarkable restraint. Makes me all the more confident in you next time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Next time?! Oh-no, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(ignoring his protests)<br />
Oh yeah. The retrovirus worked great!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(distracted)<br />
Really? How many are there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the ship didn't have a full complement to begin with, but, uh, still&#8230;there are a few.</blockquote>
<p>[They reach a door at the end of the corridor, which opens. Just inside is a Wraith trapped in stasis. Beckett touches the barrier. He steps forward to see level after level of Wraith in stasis.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(flabberghasted)<br />
This&#8230;is a few?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Official count is just under two hundred. Lot of them were killed in the battle. Lot more of them killed each other when the gas started changing them.  We should consider ourselves lucky. A hive ship like this could carry thousands.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(weakly)<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir has been set up in a temporary office on the base. Woolsey sits in a visitor chair, sipping coffee.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Don't misunderstand me, Doctor Weir. I'm not here to lecture you on the moral complexities of your situation. Ultimately the IOA has no official position on the matter one way or the other.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir smiles ruefully, studying Woolsey.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Cause when there's a tough decision to be made, they "suddenly" have no opinion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The lives of two hundred former Wraith are not high up on their list of priorities. But the way you dealt with the recent crisis, and quite frankly the manner in which you responded to their authority&#8230;<br />
(Weir starts to protest)<br />
<i>And</i> there's still the issue of whether the intelligence that allowed these hives to get as far as they did was passed to any other Wraith colonies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
According to Michael, it was not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I don't have to tell you that your willingness to trust this particular Wraith is not going to make for a strong defense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I didn't know I was on trial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Look. Pegasus is so far away, they never thought the Wraith would be a threat to anyone outside the members of the expedition itself.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir shakes her head in disbelief.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It was their objection to having Atlantis under military control that put me in this position in the first place!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Nothing renews your appreciation for the military like the threat of invasion from life-sucking aliens.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla passes the several guards outside Michael's door and enters. He stands at the window, looking out at the city.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Michael?</blockquote>
<p>[Michael turns and studies Teyla. She forces herself to face his scrutiny.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Even though I saved Colonel Sheppard's life and helped him stop the hives from reaching Earth&#8230;you still place me under guard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You have betrayed our trust in the past.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Trust?! I was your prisoner then. And despite what I've done for you, here I am once again.<br />
(he chuckles ruefully)<br />
I can't say I'm surprised. I wasn't welcome among my own kind. Why should I be welcome here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
She looked at me as if I was some kind of unclean "thing." I may appear as a Wraith again on the outside, but as far as they're concerned, I'm&#8230;that is why I need your help?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla takes a deep breath.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What do you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I can't stay here, and I can't return to the Wraith, which means I need to make my own way. And to do that&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to step closer. Teyla backs up a step and the guards raise their weapons. Michael smiles humorlessly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
&#8230;I need supplies and a ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are grateful for your help, but we can never release you. Not with the information you possess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Then kill me now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is another way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Take the treatment again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
What I am is not a disease you can cure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Your life as a human could be long and full.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
And if I remember nothing of what or who I am&#8230;if this consciousness is erased&#8230;.what is the difference between that and death? And if I do remember and revert back to my true nature? What will happen then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor Beckett has made significant advances. The treatments are more effective now and eventually he may find a permanent solution.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael approaches. This time Teyla does not back away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
If you really believed that, those Wraith you transformed wouldn't be in stasis on the ship. They'd be here, reveling in your hospitality.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir does paperwork at her desk. There is a knock at the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(calling)<br />
Come in.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Weir?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir grimaces, but stands to greet him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The IOA has decided that for the time being, you should continue to head the Atlantis expedition.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir cannot conceal her surprise.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You're surprised?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes. I am. I guess this means that international mistrust of the U.S. military is far more powerful than their fear of "life-sucking aliens."</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey smiles at the quote. He starts cleaning his glasses.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The truth is, the delegates are split. In order to avoid a deadlock, they decided on a temporary reinstatement pending a detailed report on the situation in Pegasus.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Written by&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(shrugs reluctantly)<br />
Me. I'll be going back to Atlantis with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Have you ever been offworld before, Mister Woolsey?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Sure. Once.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And how did that go for you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I was nearly killed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we will do our best to make sure that doesn't happen&#8230;this time.</blockquote>
<p>[They share a small smile. Woolsey turns to go, but pauses.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I understand that Stargate Command has put in a request to the Asgard for transportation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know they don't have an awful lot of ships to spare right now, but that will shave almost two weeks off our travel time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I've never met an Asgard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(with deceptive enthusiasm)<br />
You, I think will love them. They've got a great sense of humor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(brightening)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir takes pity on him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Crestfallen, Woolsey nods and leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith ship flies in orbit above Atlantis.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard arrives to the bridge. It is full of Atlantis personnel, including McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did you figure out how to fly this thing yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh yeah, fly, shimmy, spin like a top. You didn't think it'd be hard, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just proves my confidence in you wasn't misplaced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So far, we can't get the ship to respond to anything but the most basic commands.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That doesn't do us much good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really. Look, all the more sophisticated systems, like navigation, respond to Wraith neural interface in much the same way that the puddle jumpers can be only controlled by people with the ATA genes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So we still need a Wraith to fly it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm working on a manual override! I just haven't had much luck yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(pointing excitedly)<br />
What about Teyla? Teyla's got the&#8230;Wraith gene thing. Maybe she can fly it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's worth a try, but that's not the only problem. At least half of the ship's power generating capacity is gone.  So even if I had access to spare parts, which I don't, I doubt I could fix it. Now, if we're gonna fly this thing and hope for weapons, we need to cut down on our curent power consumption.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Meaning what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Meaning the two hundred prisoners we've got in stasis? Well, we can't keep them in there forever.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reacts with concern.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Ronon strides in, priming and aiming his weapon at Michael, who stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Are you my executioner?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I wish.</blockquote>
<p>[He stuns Michael. Beckett arrives with a syringe ready and injects Michael in his neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm just glad he's not gonna remember this.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ALIEN PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard walk through an established military camp. Atlantis personnel and very pale humans (former Wraith)<br /> wander the camp.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right. This is weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why? It's just a bunch of guys.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I know what they really are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(warning)<br />
Keep that to yourself, and try to act normal.</blockquote>
<p>[A former Wraith, Lathan, taps Sheppard on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
Colonel Sheppard, I need to speak with you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard jumps, and makes an effort not to raise his weapon at the man. Ronon moves to a more protective position to the other side of Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
Oh, my name is Lathan. At least, that's what I've been told.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
Many of us have questions, Colonel. Like, how long we're going to be kept here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's up to Doctor Beckett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
He said he doesn't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which means he doesn't know the exact date. I'm sorry, this is a medical situation, and he has medical reasons. You people are under quarantine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
Why only the men?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Your women are immune to the strain. So are most of my people. Um&#8230;we've been over this a few times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
I know. I'm&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(talking over him)<br />
But until Doctor Beckett can clear you, there's nothing I can do.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon enter a tent, leaving a frustrated Lathan outside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY TENT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard watches as a Wraith assistant leaves with some test vials. When certain they're alone, he approaches Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm going to need more time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're better off conducting this research back on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And what? Just leave them here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was the plan. You remember that, Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But they're not ready yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're supposed to teach them to administer the drug themselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I have trained several of them to act as my assistants.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well good. Then there should be no problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(with frustrated sigh)<br />
Colonel, there's more here to what I'm doing than just sticking needles in their arms. For one, I have to make sure there's no signs of reversion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This planet has no gate. They've got no way off. Whatever happens, we're covered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's not what I meant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Have any of them started to remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't think so. The drug seems to keep them stable as long as they get a daily dose.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard grabs Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We don't have the manpower or the resources to babysit them forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Are you telling me if I can't come up with a permanent solution, that eventually we'll have to abandon them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nodding)<br />
Eventually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And then what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They'll turn back into the Wraith. And without any other food supply, they'll start feeding on each other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, I'm not ready to give up just yet. And like it or not, for the moment they are human and they're my responsibility. Take the ship back. I'll stay until the first resupply mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
That won't be another week at least. We've got to bring back enough food to last them until they can harvest their own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'll be perfectly safe.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns back to his work.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm leaving a security team with you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ENCAMPMENT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Lathan pauses outside a tent, then enters.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TENT</b>
</p><p>[Lathan joins several human-Wraith sitting in the tent. They appear to be waiting for him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MERRICK<br />
What did he say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
Nothing. He won't tell us anything. He's hiding something.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael sits up on a cot. He looks fully human.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
I only know that something's not right. Everything they've told us about our homeworld, the plague, how they rescued us&#8230;I don't remember a single part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Because memory loss is one of the symptoms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
How do you know that's true? We don't know them. We don't even know ourselves.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael sighs, thinking.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
They're helping us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
By keeping us trapped here with barely enough food? And no idea when or if we'll ever be allowed to leave? I say that's not good enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
What are you suggesting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MERRICK<br />
They only have a handful of soldiers. We outnumber them ten to one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
And then what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
They have some sort of ship. That's how we got here. If we have hostages&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(interrupting)<br />
What if they're telling the truth? And we are really carrying some kind of deadly plague? Even if we somehow survive and get away, all we'll be doing is spreading this disease wherever we go. Do you really want to risk that?</blockquote>
<p>[Others nod in agreement with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>LATHAN<br />
(standing)<br />
If we don't act before that ship leave, we'll be stranded on this rock forever!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MERRICK<br />
Michael's right, Lathan. It's too risky.</blockquote>
<p>[Lathan looks around, seeing that he has no supporters. He angrily leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY OUTSIDE OF MESS HALL, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey grabs an orange and a cupcake from inside the mess hall, then spots Caldwell leaning on the balustrade outside, drinking coffee and studying a report. He walks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Colonel Caldwell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />

As commander of the <i>Daedalus</i>, I have standing orders to help out around here whenever possible, but&#8230;I'm not a member of this expedition. I don't answer to the IOA, and unless otherwise directed by my superiors, I don't have to answer your questions.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey shoots Caldwell a humorless smile.]
</p>

The only reason that you're not the military commander of Atlantis is that Doctor Weir insisted that post go to Colonel Sheppard. If she were to leave&#8230;you would be the most likely candidate to take over.</blockquote>
<p>[Now Caldwell is the one to study Woolsey, flashing a humorless smile.]

I was so caught up running tests on Lathan's tissues for my research, I almost didn't notice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MORRISON<br />

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There isn't enough blood on the ground, which indicates that his heart wasn't pumping when he fell. Now, he definitely died when his neck was snapped. But I'm beginning to think the rest of injuries occurred post-mortem&#8212;presumably to make it look like an accident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sober)<br />
There's nothing we can do for them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I suppose we could not incinerate them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If Michael got his memory back, they could all know about Atlantis by now and how to find Earth. We can't take that chance. Once we get our people out, we'll give you the signal, you set off the nuke.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts flying the puddle jumper out of the bay.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CAMP, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The inhabitants have more fully converted into Wraith. From behind some barrels, Sheppard watches two stride by. He signals behind him for the others to move up, then heads forward himself. They approach from behind two Wraith hybrid guards in front of the infirmary tent. Teyla attacks one, breaking its neck, while Sheppard stabs the other. They rush into the tent.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY TENT</b>
</p><p>[Carson still lies strapped to the table. He is alone.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<p>[She checks his vitals.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He's barely conscious.</blockquote>
<p>[They both work to free Beckett. Ronon enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did you find the others?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon holds up dogtags.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They were fed on. There's not much of them left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uhn. Help me get him up.</blockquote>
<p>[They maneuver Beckett off the table.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[McKay paces nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, come on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla has Beckett hooked up to oxygen. Sheppard flies the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
We've got Carson. Morrison and his team are dead. We're heading back.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies away from the planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We're clear. Light it up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[McKay moves to the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Understood. Failsafe detonation in&#8230;three&#8230;two&#8230;one&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The Mark IX has all stages lighted, but nothing happens. Michael and others are crouched beside it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Now you see what they really think of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MERRICK<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
The bomb is receiving a detonation signal. If I hadn't deactivated it, we'd all be dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into comm)<br />
I don't understand it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into comm)<br />
You mean, what didn't happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
You're telling me the bomb didn't go off?!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He got to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We cannot leave the Wraith here to be found by the hive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get back to work on those weapons, Rodney. We're not going anywhere.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CAMP, DAWN</b>
</p><p>[The hybrids arrive back in camp to find the ones Teyla and Sheppard killed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MERRICK<br />
Should we search for the prisoner?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
There's no point. He's been taken up to their ship by now. In any case, he served his purpose. There's nothing left for us to do but wait for our brothers to rescue us soon.</blockquote>
<p>[He watches the others all go. Michael pauses and looks around the camp.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The others join McKay on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How're you doing with the weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We couldn't hit the side of a barn!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hive ships are a hundred times&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(clarifying)<br />
A giant, flying barn! We couldn't hit that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about hitting a stationary target?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All motion in space is relative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm talking about on the planet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that I might be able to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Target the camp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Wait just a minute!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've had this discussion before, Doc. There's no choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We could go down in a jumper and take as many as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We have no time. The other hive ship's gonna be here any minute, and we won't survive a battle. It's my call.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There's still over a hundred men down there that believe that we are their saviors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They're about to become casualties of war.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It has to be done.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett looks horrified. The others exchange troubled looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Fire.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay hits the controls.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship starts firing on the planet below. Another hive ship exits hyperspace. It immediately starts firing on the team's hive ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Explosions rock the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the other hive! We're taking multiple hits!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the target?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's hard to say for sure how accurate our fire has been!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Blanket the entire area! We can't afford a mistake.</blockquote>
<p>[More, louder explosions rock the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Engines are off-line! We're venting atmosphere! Power's about to fail!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Atlantis team's ship continues to fire on the planet while the other hive continues to fire at them.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell enters the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Report?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
We've just about reached the planet, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell takes his seat.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Drop us out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> arrives at the planet to find themselves flying through a large debris field.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell stands and moves closer to the window to look out at the debris.]
</p>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
It's debris from the hive ship, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Life signs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
No, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What about the planet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
I'm not getting anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(quietly)<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, this is Sheppard. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into comm)<br />
Sheppard, where the hell are you?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla looks knowingly at Sheppard. He looks at her blankly before realizing.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh! Right. Sorry.</blockquote>

</p><p>[The puddle jumper uncloaks where it hovers over <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
We're picking up a jumper, sir. Five life signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

You got here in good time, Colonel. We were looking at a long ride home.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits across from Weir. He is reading a report.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You're still not certain if any of the Wraith on the planet survived.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Not certain, no. My people were concerned about their own survival at that time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(nodding)<br />
Understandably.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But of course, it's my fault they were in that position in the first place. If I had just disposed of those prisoners, none of this would've happened. Isn't that what you're gonna write in your report?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Quite the contrary, in fact. It was your decision to fire on the camp from orbit that eliminated the threat&#8212;at least, we hope it was eliminated&#8212;and allowed your team to escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(confused)<br />
I didn't make that decision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
But you would've. If, hypothetically, Doctor McKay had managed to get the hive subspace communicator working and you'd been apprised of the situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Well, I&#8230;I might have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Close enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But that's not what happened!</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey tosses the report in his briefcase and closes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The IOA doesn't need to know that. In fact, they don't want to know that. You see, in my business sometimes it's more important not to let inconvenient facts get in the way of the greater truth. And the truth is, you should remain here, in charge of this expedition.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir is taken aback. She looks down.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
&#8230;for the moment.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves before she can respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(to gate room technicians)<br />
Dial Earth, please.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir goes to the window in her office to watch him leave.]
