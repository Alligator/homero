<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard watches from the balcony as a MALP enters an active wormhole. McKay sits a station. Weir is nearby, as well as other personnel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wormhole's established. MALP is on the way.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks over to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What kind of facility is this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Some sort of research outpost. Database has very little information about it, other than whatever work was being done there was completed and the place was apparently abandoned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, sounds promising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
We have MALP telemetry. Environmental sensors indicate viable life support. Visuals coming in now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Put it on screen.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay, Weir, and Sheppard approach a monitor on the far wall. The image is full of static at first, then reveals several human looking people very close to the MALP staring into the camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe it never was abandoned.</blockquote>
<p>[One of the people, Niam, holds an Ancient scanner, examining the MALP.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Huh. Ancients?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They've got one of their scanners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Well, so do we. Just because they know how to use Ancient technology doesn't mean they're&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
(over video, clearly enunciating)<br />
I am speaking to whoever sent this machine to our home. If you intend us harm, proceed no further. But if you come in friendship, please know you are most welcome here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The wormhole is active. Teyla is geared up and waiting when Ronon arrives twirling his pistol. Sheppard and McKay arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Put that thing away. I told 'em we were friendly.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon holsters his pistol and holds his arms wide, innocently.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm friendly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is that thing set to stun?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon unholsters the pistol flamboyantly and resets it before holstering it again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Friendlier.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir joins the group, also outfitted for offworld travel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Are you coming too?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, Ancients or not, they are obviously an advanced society, and I would like to establish diplomatic relations with them immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you're the boss. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team and Weir enter the wormhole.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team exits the wormhole and look around at the familiar surroundings. It appears as if they have returned to where they started.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did we make a U-turn?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls out his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. This is the place. We're here.</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate shuts down behind Weir. She turns, instead of a window, like on Atlantis, she sees a long corridor behind the Stargate. Niam and the others walk towards them.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look.</blockquote>
<p>[The others turn around.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So&#8230;not exactly like our Gate Room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(cautiously)<br />
Hello. We're the people who sent the machine to you earlier. We come in friendship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
I am Niam. Welcome to Asuras.</blockquote>
<p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Niam leads the group down a long corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to McKay)<br />
I'm still waiting to meet an Ancient race that's invented a car.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Our destination is not much further. The High Council is eager to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How long have your people lived here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
We built this city thousands of years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, you actually built it? You didn't just find it this way?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And you've had no trouble with the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Any particular reason?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
The Wraith do not concern us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Ah, see, he didn't answer my question.<br />
(louder, to Niam)<br />
I'm sorry, you didn't actually answer my question.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam leads them to an outer balcony. They look at their surroundings in awe.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh my&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No kidding.</blockquote>
<p>[The Ancient city-ship sits in a lake, dwarfed by a city scape that surrounds it from all sides.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How many people live here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Millions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the-the power requirements for a city this size must be enormous! Well, plus, uh-uh, shielding from the Wraith, we're talking, what, three zero point modules, maybe four?</blockquote>
<p>[Niam looks at McKay blankly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um, sorry. ZPMs. Uh, um, uh a device that taps vast amounts of power from vacuum energy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Oh, yes. We have many of those.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Exactly how many is "many"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Exactly" doesn't matter. "Many" is plenty!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Truthfully, I do not know the exact number. More than enough to suit our needs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I assume that you, um, built them yourselves?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(giddy)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispering)<br />
Easy Rodney, you're slobbering.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
(smiling)<br />
Please. The Council is waiting.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam leads the way down the corridor. McKay quickly follows. The others hang back for a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, we have our answer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
To what question?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Whether or not they're Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In which case, I've got a bone to pick with them.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to follow Niam.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBERS</b>
</p><p>[The Atlantis team stands before a group of people seated around tables set in a horseshoe pattern. Four people are on either side (including Niam). At the center, slightly higher table, sits Oberoth.]
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Where did you come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We are explorers. We come from a world very far from here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really far. In fact&#8230;you can't get there from here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
How did you happen to discover us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We came across an Ancient outpost that listed this 'gate address in its database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But no other information, I might add. Oddly, the database neglected to include any information on a society of millions of Ancients, such as&#8230;yourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
We are the last of those you refer to as "Ancients". We were once a race united in our pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment. But our paths diverged after a disagreement tore the fabric of that unity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What kind of a disagreement?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Suffice it to say, they chose to disregard our counsel during a time of great conflict, and they suffered the consequences at the hands of a relentless enemy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Oberoth nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
We parted ways with our brothers and sisters and came here, where we have thrived for many thousands of years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(dryly)<br />
Yeah, you've been doing a lot of "thriving."</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
May I ask, what counsel did you offer that the others chose to disregard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Our Ancient brothers were arrogant. Which led them to greatly underestimate the Wraith&#8212;an enemy inferior in intelligence, yes, but vastly superior in numbers and ruthlessness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They wouldn't have been so outnumbered if you had helped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low to Weir)<br />
There's that bone I wanted to pick at.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You said they were your brothers. Where we come from, we take care of our family.</blockquote>
<p>[Oberoth glares at Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Um&#8230;what my friend is trying to say is&#8230;there's still a lot of Wraith out there, and we could sure use your help fighting them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Eradication of them is among our goals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(excited)<br />
You mean you have a plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
We do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great! Let's hear it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's smile falters at Oberoth's stern expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Your plan, I mean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(condescending)<br />
I doubt you would be able to grasp its complexity and scope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chuckling with false humility)<br />
Fortunately, I'm very good with complexity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And scope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
All you need to know is that one day soon, the Wraith will exist no more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All we need to know&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
There are matters of importance for me to attend to.</blockquote>
<p>[He nods to Niam, who stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
In the meantime, you are explorers, and presumably in need of rest and sustenance. We've made arrangements for you to spend a <i>short</i> time among us.</blockquote>
<p>[Security herd the Atlantis group out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Niam leads the group down another corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
He says the <i>other</i> Ancients are arrogant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
I apologize if you thought Oberoth was condescending in any way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How about in every way?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
It is difficult for him to see you as capable of understanding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well how many PhDs does he have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Er, Niam, I was wondering, your people have been here for thousands of years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, in that time, most Ancients we know have ascended.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam stops short.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
(intrigued)<br />
You know of ascension?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, yes. In-in fact, we always thought that Ancients were no longer around&#8212;that most of them evolved to the point of transforming into beings of pure energy&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
(excited, interrupting)<br />
This is true!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But I take it your people aren't interested?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Oh, ascension's the goal of many of us. But Oberoth feels there is still much to do. We must become all that we can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You don't agree with him, do you?</blockquote>
<p>[Niam looks around, disturbed by what he has revealed.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Your guest quarters are this way.</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries down the corridor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS GUEST QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[The team lounge impatiently in the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It must have been quite a serious falling out for the Ancients to eliminate any reference to them in the entire database?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Unless they are lying. Might it not be possible that these people merely&#8230;discovered this city, as you discovered Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wouldn't be surprised. They don't seem very&#8230;Ancienty to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Ancienty?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Yes, that's the word I was looking for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You think they could be deceiving us?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I think Teyla's right. They could'a found the city the way it was and moved in years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I feel they are hiding&#8230;something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(wryly)<br />
Other than their plan to defeat the Wraith, you mean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
There's no plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, I don't think so either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why would they say they had a plan if they don't have a plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They figured out a way to hide from the rest of the galaxy, including the Wraith, and they're happy to go on with their lives just&#8230;minding their own business.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then, whoever they are&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think that is what we need to find out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[A security guard escorts Weir in. Oberoth is alone.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you for taking the time to see me. I thought we might achieve more in a one-on-one meeting. Leader-to-leader.</blockquote>
<p>[Oberoth nods, dismissing the guard.]
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
What is it you wish to achieve?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The establishment of diplomatic and trade relations between our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(scandalized)<br />
Trade?! Do you really believe that you have anything of value to offer us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(amused)<br />
It's possible, Oberoth. And there is only one way to find that out. But I do know that there is something you could offer us: that is assistance with our fight against the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
As I said before, we will commence our plan at a time of our choosing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Would you at least consider sharing with us the tools so we can better protect ourselves, until that time comes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Tools? Such as&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What we call Zero Point Modules, they're our power source. We are in urgent need of as many as you can spare.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(interested)<br />
Then I am to assume that this settlement of yours is of Lantian design?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir pauses, considering her answer.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes. We discovered it on our travels. It was uninhabited, so we decided to establish a base there. But as I'm sure you know, sufficient shield generation requires tremendous amounts of power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Where is this settlement of yours located?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's on the outer edges of this galaxy, in an area teeming with Wraith hive ships, which is why we need the power modules.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
We are unable to part with any of our power modules. Our energy needs require the use of all of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, would you consider offering your city as a place of refuge to my people if&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Many of our citizens are amused by the occasional visitor, such as yourselves, for a short time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But not you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(half to herself)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
And the very idea of greater numbers over a protracted period of time is entirely out of the question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Now we have had some success fighting off the Wraith, and that has been with limited supplies and personnel. I truly believe that with your assistance, we might be able to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(interrupting)<br />
I am unaccustomed to repeating myself! However, leader to leader, I will say this once again. We will eliminate the Wraith at a time of <i>our</i> choosing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you don't care how many of my people or anyone else dies while you make up your mind to act? You said earlier that your brothers' greatest weakness was their arrogance. May I suggest it runs in the family?</blockquote>
<p>[Oberoth watches her leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR AND GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Niam escorts the group through the corridor towards the Stargate. They are now dressed in their tac vests and gear.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
I'm sorry you feel you must leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, so am I.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Oberoth can be&#8230;intractable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not exactly the word I was looking for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(deadpan)<br />
Un-Ancienty?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not that word either.</blockquote>
<p>[They reach the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We will send you a message through the Stargate soon. Oh, hopefully this is just a stumbled beginning&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Several armed Asurans surround the team. McKay raises his hands as Sheppard, Ronon and Teyla raise their weapons. Weir stands in shock. Oberoth approaches. Niam goes to stand beside Oberoth, looking disappointed.]
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Lower your weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard lowers his aim from chest level, still pointing it at Oberoth.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How much lower would you like them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Do you really wish to challenge us?</blockquote>
<p>[The guard directly behind Sheppard nudges Sheppard with his own weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uhn. Maybe the floor? Heh.</blockquote>
<p>[He lowers his rifle. The others follow suit.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Now I thought you didn't want us here, Oberoth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
I don't. But you possess information that I simply must have.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS PRISON CELL</b>
</p><p>[The team share a cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
These trade negotiations can be real murder.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon receives a shock from the shield as he tests the enclosure.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to find a way out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
With a cell as similar to ours, is there something in the design that could offer a possible escape?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you serious? It's a jail cell!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the only way out of here would be to first disable the force field around the bars, which is only accessible from the&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The force field lowers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
&#8230;outside.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam enters, pushing a cart full of food. Two guards follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
I brought you food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh thank god. I'm starving.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands and heads to the cart, but Ronon puts a hand on his shoulder, stopping him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, no. I can't think on an empty stomach!</blockquote>
<p>[An unsympathetic Ronon merely gestures with his thumb that McKay get behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why are we being held here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Oberoth wishes to speak to you further, and he feels that he no longer trust that you'll remain in your quarters.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon casually munches on some crackers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, he's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, if he wants to talk to us, why doesn't he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
He will. Very soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's nice. Isn't that nice?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Teyla nod.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Here's a question. Who the hell are you people?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And don't tell us you're Ancients! We know enough about them to know they would never treat people this way.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon bends down as if to spit out a cracker. While crouched, he exchanges a poignant look with Sheppard, indicating the guard behind him. Sheppard gives a barely perceptible nod.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
I am sorry about this. But I am certain once Oberoth is finished his discussions with you, you'll all be released unharmed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dryly)<br />
I'm sorry, but all your credibility was lost when you locked us up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
You left us no choice.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon spits a cracker at the guard, catching him unawares. He proceeds to attack. Sheppard and Teyla use the distraction to fight the others. They easily get the upper hand. Before Niam knows it, he's lying on the floor, Sheppard and Ronon now holding the guards' weapons on him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Neither did you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leads the way out. The others follow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS STAIRWELL OUTSIDE JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[The team head up a stairwell, Teyla holding one of the confiscated weapons on Niam, who's being kept with them.]
</p><p>[Sheppard opens the door to the jumper bay, then turns to face Niam.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're the one we like, so don't take this personally.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam starts to turn around, but gets struck by a punch to the face by Ronon. They drag him out of the doorway and run to a jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[They all race inside. McKay pauses in the rear compartment to manipulate a panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Preventing the jumper from communicating with the control room. Element of surprise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

This is how we were born. We took the image of our creators, yet we were far different from them. The aggression programmed into our core remained, fueling a rage we could not contain. We implored them to have this violent nature removed from our programming, but the Ancients wanted a weapon. And since their scientists included a directive prohibiting us from ever harming them, they continued the experiment. When the Ancients had concluded that the experiment had gone too far, that we would never become the weapon they desired to create, they decided to end it.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What about Niam? Are we not exploiting his trust?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Even if he's able to honor his end of the deal, there's no guarantee he can stop Oberoth from attacking Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We will offer him the chance to come with us, but we cannot leave this city intact.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Asuras city-ship flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GUEST QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on a small Ancient hand computer. Sheppard hovers over his shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure this'll work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(holding in his irritation)<br />
Please. Of course it will work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why's it taking so long?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, why do you always have to&#8230;? Look, I need to properly calibrate the frequencies. I want to make sure that when I freeze them, I freeze them all, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All would be good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay&#8230;ju-&#8230;let me finish?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard immediately hovers over the other shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, here we&#8230;<br />
(he looks for Sheppard over the wrong shoulder at first)<br />
Here we go, in five&#8230;four&#8230;three&#8230;two&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Replicators walk the hallways outside the guest quarters, which are guarded by two Replicators. Everyone suddenly freezes. The door opens, and the team cautiously exits.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! It worked!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Interesting.</blockquote>
<p>[He pickpockets the guard's weapon. Ronon does the same with the other guard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, we should move to the ZPM room.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon points his weapon at a bewildered Niam wandering the halls towards them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why isn't he frozen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
His code's changed. Until he's distributed it to the others in the next merge, he'll be different from the rest of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<p>[A flash of light passes throughout the area with a whooshing sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We just dropped out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Niam)<br />
Come with us. I'll explain on the way.</blockquote>
<p>[He follows her.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS ZPM ROOM</b>
</p><p>[A Replicator is frozen over the controls as McKay and the others enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now, Ronon? I could use, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures dismissively at the Replicator. Ronon stares deadpan at McKay and knocks the Replicator down with one hand. McKay heads to the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam heads over to where the ZPMs are out of their slots, still glowing with power.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
You want me to go with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(sighing)<br />
You must understand our situation. If you can't stop Oberoth&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
(resentful)<br />
I said I would do everything in my power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But can you promise that you will succeed?</blockquote>
<p>[Niam shakes his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Our lives and the lives of all of our people are at stake here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If you merge through a subspace connection, even if you're with us, you should be able to spread the new code amongst the others.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam looks troubled.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Come with us, Niam. Ascension is within your grasp. You can't turn back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Damn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In order to do this, I need to utilize all three ZPMs. I was hoping to bring at least one of them back with us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do what you can. We only have three minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I already told you, it&#8230;never mind
(snapping at Niam)<br />
Need an access code to remove the failsafes.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam looks at Weir, then nods and heads over to the console and enters the access code.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now, how bout our weapons?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
We can recover them on the way.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads them out of the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[As the group round a corner, they find Oberoth standing amongst the other frozen Replicators.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa!</blockquote>
<p>[They all point their weapons, Sheppard breathing nervously, but Oberoth too is frozen. McKay draws closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hah! Not so arrogant now, are you?</blockquote>
<p>[In that instant, Oberoth breaks free of the freezing glitch and grabs McKay by the vest.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon runs forward as Oberoth tosses McKay aside. He deflects Ronon's attack as well, throwing him to the floor with one hand. The other Replicators are slower to act. They still reach for their weapons as Sheppard and Teyla open fire with their P-90s. Ronon strikes with his pistol. The Replicators still don't seem to be able to move their legs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on!</blockquote>
<p>[The team runs out and heads up the steps.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So much for seven and a half minutes!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It was an arbitrary number!</blockquote>
<p>[They run into another corridor, sealing the door behind them with a weapon's blast. Two Replicators are already aiming weapons at them. They stop at a standoff, Teyla guarding their rear.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns to see what she's noticed. The door warps and a humanoid figure seems to bulge and stretch the door. Oberoth eventually pushes his way through the sealed door. Ronon is able to stun the guards and Oberoth.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go!</blockquote>
<p>[They run again.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Asuran city-ship approaches Lantia.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The team hold at the end of a corridor, Sheppard checking if the way is clear.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon, set your gun to kill.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon adjusts his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Okay, start the overload.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? No-no-no. Not yet. We need to be in a jumper, or clear of the city, or-or&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Jumper bay's not far. We're almost there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no. You don't understand. Look, I didn't want them to be able to stop it. Hey, look, as soon as I trigger the overload, there'll be practically zero lag time before it blows.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Practically?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, fine, so like a few seconds for it to build up power, but not&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How many seconds?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Five? Ten?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Again with the arbitrary numbers!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Okay.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Start the overload, now!</blockquote>
<p>[The others run by as McKay pulls out his handheld computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This way!</blockquote>
<p>[A klaxon blares.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is that?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(while rushing by)<br />
The sound of the city about to blow! Move!</blockquote>
<p>[They reach the jumper bay area, shooting cover fire before rushing inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[They rush inside the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get the roof open, Rodney, or this is gonna be a short trip.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't wait for me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm just saying, if we can't get out of the jumper bay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It doesn't matter. The overload's happening now. We're about to explode.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is the roof open!?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks his controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Go.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The city ship explodes under them as the puddle jumper flies away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS PIER, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[A sentry patrols an outer pier of the city. He is distracted by a sudden bright light appearing in the night sky. The light quickly fades.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Everyone cautiously looks for signs of pursuit, but they only see the fading light of the explosion.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Nice work, all of you.<br />
(turning to Niam)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Niam smiles shyly, then tilts his head, seeming distracted.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
Something is happening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Niam continues to crick his neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
The others on my planet. They know what I've done.  I'm being reset!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(panicked)<br />
Rodney, do something!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches for his handheld computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>NIAM<br />
It's too late. They're&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He suddenly reaches forward and starts choking Weir. Teyla and Ronon try and pry him loose as Weir gasps for breath. Sheppard's added efforts are able to knock Niam into the rear compartment. Sheppard seals the door shut.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's not going to hold him!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reaches forward and slams a button on the pilot's control panel.]
</p><p>[In the rear compartment, the hatch blasts open, immediately decompressing the compartment and sweeping Niam into space.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies away as Niam's body tumbles into space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla helps Weir sit as she coughs and tries to regain her breath. Weir nods she's okay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm so sorry. I-I didn't&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The team exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(smiling in relief)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sighs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters. Zelenka and McKay are sitting at computers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Still nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Either the Ancients chose to purposely conceal every record, extremely well I might add, or they simply deleted them from the database. I'm leaning towards the latter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Perhaps they think they truly destroyed them all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Either that, or they didn't want anyone to know they had failed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Again. There is nothing more annoying than people who won't admit their own mistakes.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka slowly turns and stares at McKay in disbelief at the irony. Sheppard looks at Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(deadpan)<br />
True.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Weir stands at the balcony staring at the water. Sheppard joins her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay and Zelenka are scouring the database for any information. So far, not much&#8230;as in, nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm. These Replicators, they are probably already at work building themselves another Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now they know all about us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(with false brightness)<br />
Well, we beat them this time. Maybe we scared them off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah&#8230;maybe.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Niam floats in space. He is still alive and conscious, staring down at the city.]
