<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is in a cockpit, wearing a spacesuit, including helmet. The cockpit is vibrating intensely.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Initiating separation maneuver in three&#8230;two&#8230;one&#8230;mark!</blockquote>
<p>[He presses a button. An alarm sounds.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Separation is negative, switching to backup. Disengage, come on.</blockquote>
<p>[The alarm sounds again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dammit! The bolts will not work. I repeat, the explosive bolts will not fire! Unable to separate ship! I don't know if you can hear me, but it looks like I'm going to have to ride this one down!</blockquote>
<p>[He struggles to keep control of the joystick.]
</p><p><b>EIGHT HOURS EARLIER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The team is inside a space station that is inside a lifeless moon.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay, wearing space suits, walk through a darkened corridor, using flashlights to light their way.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you wanted to take a look, now you have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? We just got here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've been here long enough. There's nothing here of any use to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can't know that until we've explored deeper into the station.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guarantee, you're gonna see pretty much the same technology that you're looking at here, which I'd call vintage 1967.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustically)<br />
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, we hollowed out a lot of moons back in the sixties.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if we did, this is what it would it would look like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What about that shuttle, huh? You know, the one we saw when we docked?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was very 007.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, see? Even you were intrigued.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(admitting)<br />
A little bit.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay spots something on a side corridor and takes off. Sheppard continues forward, not noticing McKay has left him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, Elizabeth gave us the go ahead to explore this station, if, and I underline the "if" there, we find anything we can use against our many and sundry bad guys. This technology's antiquated at best. These containers are just full of supplies.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rejoins Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Building a place like this <i>inside</i> a moon must've taken tremendous resources. Whoever built it, must've had a damn good reason. And if we want to find out what that reason is, we need to look further inside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla, Ronon, you listening to this?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION DOCKING AREA</b>
</p><p>[An alien space craft sits at one of the darkened docks. The only lights come from inside the puddle jumper, which is docked at another spot. Teyla and Ronon are inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
Yes, yes we are, Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You guys care what's inside this place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(diplomatically)<br />
Perhaps it would be more appropriate for a team of scientists to return.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good idea. We're out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait, wait, wait, wait! "I<i> need to find out what's inside. I'm the same way with Christmas presents and pinatas. One more compartment, other side of this door.</blockquote></i>
<p>[He points out a closed door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Just one more!</blockquote>
<p>[They open the door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Looks like some kind of control room.</blockquote>
<p>[They look around. Sheppard looks outside a window at the alien spacecraft in the docking bay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look at that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Heh, heh, heh. Intrigued?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like it was built for re-entry.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It looks like some kind of rudimentary computer system, but it's locked up. Let me see if I can reboot it&#8230;get power online.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at other controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(concerned)<br />
You think that's such a good idea? Didn't you say this station's probably powered by a nuclear reactor?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay throws some switches.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, it's definitely powered by a reactor, and&#8230;I just increased its power output.</blockquote>
<p>[The level of lighting increases.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angry)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unrepentant)<br />
You said you wanted to take a closer look at that shuttle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I did not!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay continues to work controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, well you were thinking it. Besides, I'll have life support online in no time. Closing outer doors&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried)<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So we can re-pressurize the hangar, so we can get out of these suits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not our job to satisfy your curiosity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, we can't stop now. We just cracked open the pinata!</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, what's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm picking up an energy spike from one of the other compartments.</blockquote>
<p>[The alarm suddenly ceases.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
Now it's gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not good. There's something frighteningly familiar about that energy signature. Check your life signs detector again.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at the device.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've got company.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay enter the room. There are two long tables; one is empty. On the other a large chamber has lights on. They cautiously move through the room, finding a man lying sprawled on the floor, unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Who the hell is this guy?</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate is active. Weir speaks into the radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You reported that there were no life signs. How did he get there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We don't know yet.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is out of his space suit. McKay has removed his helmet. Teyla treats the unconscious man.]
</p><p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard's team's location and Atlantis.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Some kind of a energy spike right when his life signs popped up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I recognized the energy signature. It's very similar, virtually identical to Wraith beaming technology. I-I-I think he was automatically reintegrated when life support systems started up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Beaming technology?! A minute ago, you said the station was antiquated!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eh, other than the one upgrade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And the artificial gravity.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks out of the jumper and looks around the station again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'd say early Apollo program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I'll need to take a closer look, but I am pretty sure that that device is modified Wraith technology. Probably from a crashed dart. If you think about it, it's actually a brilliant fusion of&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(interrupting)<br />
And what do you intend to do with this person we've now assumed responsibility for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I don't know. I didn't think that far ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, obviously not, but if one person beamed out of nowhere&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There may be others where he came from. I was thinking the same thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He is regaining consciousness!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reenters the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. We'll find out in a minute. Our little boy's waking up. We'll call you in one hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
One hour it is.</blockquote>
<p>[The connection to Atlantis shuts off.]
</p><p>[The man, Herick, groans as he sits up. He looks at the team in alarm.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(reassuring)<br />
It is all right. You are among friends.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at them all again.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
(hoarsely)<br />
The war is over?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not from here. I'm Sheppard; this is McKay, Teyla, Ronon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Herick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am sorry, Herick, but we have scanned the surface of your planet. If your world was at war with the Wraith, the war was lost, many years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm, more like centuries. I mean, there's nothing down there but ruins and plant life.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shifts uncomfortably at McKay's comments.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dial up the sensitivity a notch, all right?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks startled.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Defeat was expected, but&#8230;but the computer was supposed to extract me automatically&#8212;in order to restore the others.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Unfortunately, the computer froze. It was completely locked up. You probably should've used a Mac.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What-what others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
The others in storage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You used Wraith beaming technology for long-term storage? That's crazy! Well, the energy patterns couldn't possibly stay stable that long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Our engineers found a way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Back up a second. How many others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Each module was to store over a thousand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then&#8230;this place was&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Created to save the last of my people. Once the Wraith were gone, and the planet was once again habitable, I was to fly one of the two shuttles back to the surface, but&#8230;obviously something went wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On that subject, uh, there's only one shuttle out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
No, that's impossible.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands wobbly and tries to leave. Ronon holds him back with a hand on his chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Please! I must get to the pattern storage room! The second storage pattern module was to be stored on the other shuttle. Half those chosen for the sanctuary were to be on board, including my wife and son.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Yeah, let him go.<br />
(to Teyla and McKay)<br />
You two stay here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon run after Herick.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[They arrive seconds after Herick, who's very distraught.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
They were to launch within hours of us. Jamus gave me his word.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe the Wraith got to them before they could get to it.</blockquote>
<p>[Herick starts handling the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
No, they were ready. I spoke to the pilot myself. They were just hours behind us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sheppard, I'm getting another power spike. What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Getting answers.</blockquote>
<p>[And older man is re-materialized. Sheppard and Ronon raise their weapons automatically. Herick attacks him, bunching his fists into the man's shirts.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
They were to be here when I awoke. You gave me your word!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
Herick!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pulls Herick off him. Jamus collapses onto a seat.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, take it easy! Let the man take a breath!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Where is the second storage device?</blockquote>
<p>[He points to the empty table. Jamus's expression changes to understanding, and sadness.]
</p>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
(still breathless)<br />
They waited too long to launch the second shuttle. Herick, I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
I worked every day of my life to complete this place, with the promise that when it was done, my wife and son would be among the ones saved. You made me that promise when you stored my pattern in the device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
Shortly after you were stored in the device, word came from the planet that the last group had not yet made it to the second shuttle. With the launch of the first just hours before, the secret was out. There were riots on the street! Much of our leadership was in that last group!</blockquote>
<p>[Jamus rises, and paces, frustrated.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
You delayed the launch. How long did you wait?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
A day. But in that day, the Wraith came, Herick. Through the portal. We knew it was the beginning. We knew it was an advance scout. It had happened far too many times in our history. We knew!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
Why didn't you order them to launch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
Because the second shuttle would've led the Wraith straight here! It was the only way. You must understand that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It sounds to me like you did it to save yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
No. To preserve the others who are already in storage. If the Wraith had followed the second shuttle, if they had discovered what we had done, they would've blasted this moon from the sky! It was the hardest decision I have ever made. But if I had not made it, your life's work would've meant nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Another life sign just appeared on the shuttle's HUD.<br />
(he spots Jamus)<br />
Oh. Hi. I'm McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay. I was the one who powered up your station.</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches out his hand to shake. Jamus nods politely.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
And&#8230;you're welcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
(politely)<br />
My people are grateful for your assistance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
We don't need them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(insulted)<br />
We do have a ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smugly)<br />
One that, no offense, is better than that, uh, shuttle you've got there? We could get you back down to the planet and restoring your civilization in no time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
(bitter)<br />
Does your ship have an internal power supply attuned to the storage device?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange looks. Jamus holds out his hand reassuringly and moves closer to Herick.]
</p>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
Herick wishes to finish the task that will complete his life's work. And when you've flown our people back to the surface, then the new era we have dreamed of will begin, free of the Wraith for all time!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
(flatly)<br />
For all time. Forgive me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon studies the exchange. Jamus claps Herick on the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
I must prepare the shuttle for launch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Herick leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, if you want a hand with the, uh, control room, I could um&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Herick keeps moving, ignoring McKay, who pops his lips several times, recognizing the snub.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or maybe not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll leave you folks to it.</blockquote>
<p>[Jamus nods. Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon start to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Uh, Sheppard, I wouldn't leave this guy with that guy right now, not unless you want this guy dead.</blockquote>
<p>[He points towards Jamus. The trio pauses at the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You really think he would, uh&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I would.</blockquote>
<p>[They look at Jamus, who's working the controls, oblivious to them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Jamus, we're gonna&#8230;stick around for a while, make sure everyone gets safely back to the planet&#8230;happy to give you a ride if you need one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
(with wan smile)<br />
Thank you, I-I'm most grateful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Why don't you head up to the control room?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts off. Ronon hangs back.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Teyla, we're going to stay a little longer.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Herick enters and activates some controls. In the hangar, the shuttle begins to power up. He leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION</b>
</p><p>[Herick runs through the corridors, slamming open half-way closed doors in his haste. He reaches the shuttle docking bay.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE</b>
</p><p>[Herick enters the shuttle, opening each section on his way. Teyla intercepts him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sympathetically)<br />
Herick, I understand how difficult this must be for you. I too have lost&#8230;many loved ones to the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
(emotional)<br />
What I feel was not caused by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Still, if there is anything&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
(interrupting sharply)<br />
You've done enough!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I&#8230;do not understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERICK<br />
If you had never come, if I had never awoken, my last thoughts would've been of hope for the future and the love I had for my family. I never would've had to feel what I feel now. Gather your team and leave this place.</blockquote>
<p>[Herick storms away. Teyla chases after him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Herick! Herick!</blockquote>
<p>[Herick brushes past McKay on his way. Teyla stops chasing him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted)<br />
Oh, he's not doing so good, is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing, frustrated)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[She heads in another direction.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Jamus works on the storage device.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is everyone still in there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
It appears we spent far longer in the device than was ever intended, but yes, it seems our engineers did very well.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard, I'm concerned about Herick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
There's nothing we can do for him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(concerned)<br />
He just warned us to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
(dismissively)<br />
He's understandably distraught. He'll be fine when he gets to the planet.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon do not look appeased; they take Teyla's concern seriously.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just the same, I'm going to go see what he's up to.<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
You stay here.</blockquote>
<p>[Jamus looks up, surprised. Sheppard and Ronon leave Teyla with Jamus.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE</b>
</p><p>[Herick runs through the shuttle, leaving open every door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay notices alarms starting to beep. ]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is he doing?</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to the window to look at the shuttle. Herick stares back at him from a full length window in the corridor. Herick starts to run back down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Herick, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE</b>
</p><p>[Herick climbs a stairwell to the cockpit and sits in the seat, powering things up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
Sheppard, you need to get Herick out of that shuttle, now!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon run towards the shuttle.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're on our way.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Herick continues to operate controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Herick, if you're doing what I think you're do&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Herick shuts off the radio. He presses more buttons and the engines start up. He leaves cockpit.]

</p><p>[McKay watches as the shuttle rockets fire, but the ship remains docked inside the closed bay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's fired the engines! Hang on!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE</b>
</p><p>[Looking desperate, but determined, Herick walks back to the window.]

What's happening?</blockquote>

We came to realize that if there were no more survivors, the Wraith would not return. We built weapons to ensure that when the war was over, there would be no more survivors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(appalled)<br />
You killed your own people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
We killed Wraith. Every ship that landed was struck by our atomic weapons. We knew that the radioactive clouds would spread over every continent. We knew the planet would be uninhabitable for many years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
And so you built this place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
That we could rebuild without fear of the Wraith ever returning. So you see, these souls <i>must</i> survive. If they do not, the many hundreds of thousands lost in the war will have died for nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla reaches towards Jamus, but he waves the pistol, keeping her back.]
</p>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
Don't! Don't! Your life is all I have to bargain with, I do not wish to take it.</blockquote>
<p>[The station shudders even more violently, but Jamus keeps his hold and distance.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The moon is starting to burn in the upper atmosphere.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
This is taking too bloody long!</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne has his P-90 at ready.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going as fast as I can!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Jamus backs over to the module device.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Any moment now, Colonel Sheppard will cut through that door. If you shoot me, they will surely kill you. Perhaps, the only way to preserve your people now is to preserve their memory! If you die, they will be forgotten; their deaths will go unrecorded, and the Wraith will have won. Or leave here with us now, and keep the spirit of your people alive inside you. Document their achievements! Their struggles&#8230;and triumphs. Tell their story to anyone who will listen. The choice is yours.</blockquote>
<p>[Another shudder rocks the station. Jamus presses some more buttons on the module.]
</p>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
I never intended to take your life. My only hope is that Colonel Sheppard is sincere in his statement that he will leave no one behind.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla's eyes widen as she stares at Jamus's efforts.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDOR JUNCTION</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is almost through.]
</p>
<blockquote>JAMUS<br />
(yelling through door)<br />
Colonel! Colonel! You can stop what you're doing now. I'm ready to open the door.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stops. Ronon raises his gun so it's no longer pointed at the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now he's ready.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes off his equipment and stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we're going to open up the door. I want to see your weapon on the ground and your hands in the air.</blockquote>
<p>[The wheel slowly turns from the inside as Sheppard unholsters his pistol and waits with the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sheppard, what's going on? I'm picking up another power surge.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard exchanges puzzled looks with Lorne. He kicks the hatch open.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[The module is just shutting down as they enter. Neither Teyla nor Jamus can be seen. Sheppard stares in horror at the device.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The moon's orbit continues to decay, rubbing against the atmosphere.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay has joined Sheppard and is now studying the module.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you going to be able to get her out of there or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have no idea how to determine who's who in this thing. Look, maybe if I had a few hours&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you don't!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I know. But short of randomly beaming people out one-by-one&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's a thousand people in this thing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(tightly)<br />
I am aware of that!</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne arrives just as another violent rocking moves across the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
It's time to go, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just give us a minute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I'm sorry, sir. We don't have a minute. As soon as this rock hits the atmosphere, it's going to start to break up. We've got to go now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Can-can you get this thing disconnected?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, but I've already told you there's no way I can rig up a compatible power source for the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not talking about the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was always wanted to fly a space shuttle. Now's my chance!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts heading out with a quick determined gait. McKay follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just get this thing disconnected and help these guys get it to the jumper while I suit up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I know how much you love to think you can fly anything, but it is not&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard doesn't stop or turn back.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(yelling)<br />
Listen. Just get the thing disconnected. That's an order!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The moon begins to break up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, McKay, and Lorne wheel the module through the corridor. Ronon still cradles his injured arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I think he's crazy. The thing's how many hundred years old? <i>And</i> it's out of fuel!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
The man said he could fly it.</blockquote>
<p>[Behind them, Beckett helps Sheppard into his space suit.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You do realize you're out of your bloody mind, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Probably.</blockquote>
<p>[The station rocks again. McKay returns from where they've sealed up the device.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, you're all set. Once you're inside the shuttle, it should be fairly easy to get the device into the receptacle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just&#8230;can I say one more thing?</blockquote>
<p>[The station shudders again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
As long as you say it as fast as you can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't do this, it's impossible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Willing to bet a week's wages on that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(anguished)<br />
Yeah, how you going to pay up if I win, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, thanks for caring.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(despondent)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Radio Atlantis as soon as you're clear. Keep a safe distance with the jumper, I'll try to maintain radio contact.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stops him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey, remember. You still owe me a fight to the death.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard closes his helmet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I look forward to that.</blockquote>
<p>[He claps Ronon on his shoulder. Ronon winces in pain. Sheppard opens the shuttle door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Beckett, Ronon, and Lorne enter the puddle jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Get us out of here, Captain!</blockquote>
<p>[The captain starts to power up the jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard finishes hooking up cables to the module.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I've got the device locked in place. Looks like internal power switched on automatically. Closing rear hatch now. See you guys on the ground.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks out the window at the rocks flying off into space, and the puddle jumper leaving, as the moon enters the atmosphere.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Will do, sir. Good luck.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE STATION DOCKING BAY</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper leaves the station.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We're clear, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits in the pilot's seat.]
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the shuttle and the jumper.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The moon's decelerating in the upper atmosphere. You've only got a few minutes to familiarize yourself with those controls.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's pretty straightforward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're going to lose radio contact as you pass through the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(emotional)<br />
No, but, I'm saying that&#8230;if you have anything that you'd like to say, now would be a good time to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, not really.</blockquote>
<p>[The moon/station shudders continuously.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Taking some chop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now would probably be a good time to disengage.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls up the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hopefully the explosive bolts will throw him clear of the moon.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The moon is breaking up in the atmosphere.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Initiating separation maneuver in three&#8230;two&#8230;one&#8230;mark!</blockquote>
<p>[He presses a button. An alarm sounds.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Separation is negative, switching to backup.</blockquote>
<p>[The team on the shuttle exchange concerned looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Disengage. Come on!</blockquote>
<p>[The alarm sounds again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dammit! The bolts will not work. I repeat, the explosive bolts will not fire! Unable to separate ship! I don't know if you can hear me, but it looks like I'm going to have to ride this one down!</blockquote>
<p>[He struggles to keep control of the joystick.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If he can't separate the ship, he's going to burn up inside the moon.</blockquote>
<p>[They watch the HUD.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The moon breaks apart.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard struggles with the controls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DOCKING AREA</b>
</p><p>[The station comes apart around the shuttle.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The moon disintegrates into a fireball in the atmosphere.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[They all peer at the HUD. Finally, the shuttle appears on the display.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There it is!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sighs in relief.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The shuttle coasts into the atmosphere, surrounded by intense heat from reentry.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Klaxons continue to blare as Sheppard shakes from the entry, barely holding onto the joystick.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The shuttle appears as a white cloud streaking across the sky.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Everyone watches worriedly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard struggles to guide the ship in for a landing.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET DESERT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The shuttle glides into a controlled crash in the desert.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard collapses, unconscious, in the pilot's seat.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Get as close to the crash site as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Can you tell if he's alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not yet. Wait.</blockquote>
<p>[A control beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm detecting one life sign.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard awakens and groggily looks around.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
That's one week's pay you owe me, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, technically, I-I didn't take that bet.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Ronon laugh.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Hang tight, sir. We're on our way.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHUTTLE COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(tired)<br />
Take your time, Major. Take your time.</blockquote>
<p>[He opens his helmet to the air.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DUSK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters. Weir sits by Teyla's bedside as Teyla is examined by Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, I have the hard landing, but she gets the bed rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, I tried to tell Carson that I was perfectly fine, but he insisted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
A number of people reintegrated from the storage device experienced a small amount of memory loss. I just want to make certain that you're&#8230;all there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She does look a little thin.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla mock glares at Sheppard. Beckett claps Teyla on the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Just until the morning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
And I assume you've come to the infirmary in order to have your head examined.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, I pulled it off, didn't I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(unconvinced)<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla pats Sheppard's arm gratefully .]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, you did.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir heads out.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm going to head back to Stargate Operations. Major Lorne is about to return to drop off supplies to Jamus's people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, what are you going to do with him, anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Uh, his injuries were such, he didn't survive the reintegration. Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't break my heart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(admonishing)<br />
He only did what you or I would've done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you kidding? He held you hostage and almost got both of us killed!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He tried to save his people, and he succeeded&#8230;through you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(gently)<br />
That's not the reason I did it.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't go feeling special, now. I'd have done it for any one of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Except for maybe McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(grinning)<br />
Yes, I think even for Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe.</blockquote>
