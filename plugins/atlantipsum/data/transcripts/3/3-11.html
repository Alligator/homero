<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[Excerpts from 3.05 "Progeny" and 3.10 "The Return Part 1" are shown.]
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey cowers in a corner of a darkened corridor. He hears a noise, gets up, and cautiously approaches, holding a pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(whispering)<br />
General?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks around the corner.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
General!?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
And if I'm a Replicator?</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey jumps back, startled, then looks chastened.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Then I've just exposed my position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill and Woolsey move back to where Woolsey had been before. O'Neill pulls out a power bar from his pocket and hands it to Woolsey.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Thank God! I'm starving!</blockquote>
<p>[He starts eating the bar ravenously, then peers at O'Neill.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Was this all you could find?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
No. Actually there was a lovely buffet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How did the recon go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, the Stargate Ops is crawlin with `em. There's no way we're gonna get across to the Jumper Bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Are they looking for us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I plum forgot to ask.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill and Woolsey sit on the floor, against the corridor wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, as long as the life signs detectors aren't working in these damaged areas, we should be able to hold out until they rescue us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Uh, Richard, there's not going to be a rescue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Landry has standing orders to nuke the city if there's any sign of a foothold situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What kind of a standing order is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Mine.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STARGATE OPERATIONS</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
What's happening? Activate the shield.</blockquote>
<p>[Cetus works some controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
I can't.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOSIAN PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper hovers in front of the active Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's confirmation. The Gate shield is lowered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hope this little plan of ours works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, you and me both.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOSIAN PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies through the active wormhole.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies into the Gate room via the wormhole. Its shields are active. Replicators immediately begin to fire on the ship from various positions.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Authentication code Alpha Six Delta Charlie Niner. General O'Neill, Woolsey, do you copy?</blockquote>
<p>[The scene switches between Sheppard's and O'Neill's locations as they communicate by radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Sheppard? Is that you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, sir. I need to know if you're anywhere near Stargate Operations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
No, we're not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
That's good. Can't talk right now, sir. Get back to you in a couple of hours. Sheppard, out.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Drop the package.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay presses some buttons.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Package is away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hold on.</blockquote>
<p>[The puddle jumper goes into reverse. The event horizon has already shut down, so the vessel flies back through the inactive Stargate and through the glass behind it.]
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
Follow me.</blockquote>
<p>[Two replicators approach a black box sitting under where the puddle jumper was. It emits a beeping sound that becomes more rapid.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[As the puddle jumper flies away, the tower housing Stargate Operations explodes into a fireball.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Everyone looks on in amazement, and Ronon smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That went well.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir winces and shrugs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies away from Atlantis.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That sounded like an explosion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Because it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Is Sheppard attacking the city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
He'd better be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Why can't he get back to us for two hours?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Harriman sits at his station. Landry paces behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
It's coming up on 2300 hours, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I can see that, Chief.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I have to assume Sheppard heard my message and chose to ignore it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
There's no way to be a hundred percent certain, sir, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
He heard me alright. They're already in Pegasus doing goodness knows what. Which leaves me no choice but to lock out their IDCs and invalidate their personal authentication codes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
But, sir, if they're successful in rescuing&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
We have no way of knowing whether they've been successful or if they've been compromised. I have my standing orders, and I'm damned well going to follow them. Now, when you're done locking out those IDCs, have Doctor Lee report to my office.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS PLANET</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies in space around the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's good to be back, however briefly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I feel like I'm gonna be ill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, just take some deep breaths, Carson.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sighs and nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Should we not have informed General O'Neill of our plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He knows we're here. We'll contact him again as soon as we get closer to the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that is gonna be easier said than done. With all those hits we took, it's gonna be impossible for me to convert the shield back to a cloak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And by "impossible", you mean &#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean "not possible". What do you think I mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, hopefully we took out the sensors when we blew the tower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, you said they could rebuild remarkably fast. How long before they restore critical systems?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Who knows? A couple of hours?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's the painting and redecorating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(inspired)<br />
If we time this right, this could work to our advantage.</blockquote>
<p>[A panel beeps and the HUD appears in front of them, displaying something in space nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Got him! Right where we left him!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks his laptop computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who else would it be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
True. His power levels are barely registering. It's no wonder the Replicators didn't find him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I'll swing around and pick him up. Watch yourselves, I'm closing the bulkhead.</blockquote>
<p>[The bulkhead door closes behind Teyla and Ronon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper approaches Niam floating in space. The cargo door opens.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Will we not be vulnerable to the same nanovirus with which Niam infected Elizabeth?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla, Ronon, and Weir exchange nervous looks. Beckett still looks ill.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's been floating in space for over a month now. He's resting in such a harsh environment, direct solar radiation has severely diminished his power levels. We're fairly certain he's almost completely incapacitated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is he dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's mostly dead. Besides, we don't have a choice. He's the key to our whole plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(nervously)<br />
All right. But if he even twitches&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't worry.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon brandishes his weapon. Weir smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you!</blockquote>							
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Got him. Closing the rear hatch.<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Take the seat.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins Teyla and Ronon. Beckett replaces him in the pilot's chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The compartment's re-pressurized.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns, a handheld computer at ready. The bulkhead door opens and Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon all point the anti-replicator weapons at Niam. Niam lies sprawled on his back, looking frozen. They turn back to McKay, who winces and gets up to join them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, okay.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard move closer to Niam. McKay starts scanning Niam.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Okay, this is good. His power levels are minimal but not too minimal. I'm fairly sure he doesn't have the juice to regain consciousness.</blockquote>
<p>[Two of Niam's fingers move.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wh-whoa!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stumbles back as Ronon and Sheppard stand at ready. Niam's fingers settle back. His chest rises and falls as if breathing.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was fairly sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just&#8230;load the program.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay more cautiously approaches with the handheld device.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS WORK STATION</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
Repairs are under way in Stargate Operations, but we have lost all main sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
We are trying to route all the telemetry through these terminals but they were not designed to take on so many systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
We have stationed several observers around the city. If the gateship returns, we will detect it visually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
They communicated briefly with someone within the city. We'll send search parties here and here.</blockquote>
<p>[He indicates places on a glass schematic of the city.]
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
All of the Ancients were killed. Their commander attempted to conceal that fact as I probed her mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
There may have also been a small number of humans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
We would have detected them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
They may be hiding where the sensors are inoperable. If we want to capture the ones who attacked us, we must first capture those they came for.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is crouched near McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well? Done yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think we're good to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. I'll take us back.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gets up and moves to the pilot chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why don't we do this from here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do what from here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Render the Replicators helpless, Rodney? Remember the plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course I remember the plan. It's my plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, actually, using Niam was Elizabeth's plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It was mostly my plan.<br />
(muttering petulantly)<br />
It was my freezing program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You said they'd be frozen in place six or seven hours. Why not do it now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because I've gotta keep Niam at nominal power levels, otherwise we risk him waking up. Look, low power means short range. Short range means we need to get closer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How much closer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
With no cloak?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No cloak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good to be back home, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmph. There's no place like it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LANDRY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Landry is seated behind his desk. Lee enters and sits in one of the chairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
I realize I was duped, General, but they were incredible. It was like a scene out of <i>The Sting</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Calm down, Bill. That's not why I brought you in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(continuing)<br />
In my defense, this was obviously something they had planned for a long time&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Forget about it. I'd like to know your opinion on the best way to disable the Gate Bridge between galaxies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(blankly)<br />
We just finished building that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I'm aware of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Okay. Uh, well, umm, I-I suppose if one were to detonate a Mark Nine at the midway station, that'd pretty much do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I thought so. I'd like you to supervise the preparation of a Mark Nine to keep our options open.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee slumps back in his chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Ah. You know, you could always dismantle it. Of course, it would take a bit more time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Which we may not have.</blockquote>
<p>[Landry stands, but Lee remains slumped in the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(shocked)<br />
Wow. Th-that is such a shame.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee stays seated in the chair, lost in thought.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Doctor, why are you still in my office?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(abashed)<br />
Uh, right.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee quickly exits.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies towards the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we're about a mile out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I'll start broadcasting the virus now, but, uh, we're gonna need to get closer than that.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[A replicator standing guard on a balcony spots the ship. In another part of the city, a hatch opens, and five drones fly out, heading towards the puddle jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Drones!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're still not close enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hang on!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard flies the puddle jumper through the city in an evasive pattern, dodging the four drones chasing them as they maneuver past the various buildings. Sheppard is able to have some detonate against other buildings, but some are still on their tail.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey and O'Neill can hear the drones exploding.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That sounded like another explosion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes. Yes, it did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Something exploded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
But is it Sheppard attacking the Replicators, or the Replicators attacking Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
We'll find out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How did they even get here? Through the Gate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I've been sitting next to you through the whole thing. Why do you think I have more information?</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey drops his pistol and shrugs off his loosened tie in frustration.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Look, I told you I wasn't good at this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
He said he'd be back in a couple of hours. That gives him a good&#8230;<br />
(checking watch)<br />
&#8230;eleven seconds.</blockquote>
<p>[Another explosion happens, rocking the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If we keep this up, there won't be much of a city left to save.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
I'll try to run the drones into your least favorite buildings. McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It should be working.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, it's not working!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, if I give him any more power, he'll wake up and kill us all!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(bitingly, to McKay)<br />
Sheppard can't keep this up forever.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[One of the drones strikes the puddle jumper on its starboard side, though shields cushion the impact.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Shields have been damaged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Alright, I've had enough. I've got a different idea.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper engines retracts and it dives into the ocean. The drones do not follow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
They're overdue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It's been well over eleven seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes. But you've been ignoring the dramatic element of&#8230;suspense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
General O'Neill, are you there, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
See?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Oh, thank God!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, we're here. You're late.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry, sir. Had to go into space and pick up some&#8230;frozen goods.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill and Woolsey exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Whatever. Where are you now?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not exactly inside the city yet. We're headed toward an underwater Jumper Bay.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;OCEAN, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The jumper moves through the water.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, what we think may be an underwater Jumper Bay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Is that Doctor Weir I hear?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, General. It's good to hear your voice too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(over radio)<br />
I didn't say it was good, Elizabeth. Please, don't be offended as I express my "surprise" that Landry would send you on a mission like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, sir, General Landry didn't sanction this mission.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
So, am I to assume you are not surrounded by heavily-armed SG teams and young strapping marines?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You've got Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, Teyla, McKay, myself, and Doctor Beckett.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
Woo! Doctor Beckett, is it? Well, I'm comforted.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's that supposed to mean?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir shakes her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

</p><p>[Teyla enters and destroys the four guards there with two ARGs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Clear.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett enters and approaches the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you, dear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hurry.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits in the chair and activates it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The hole in the window is still present where the Puddle Jumper escaped, but another window has appeared behind it. Everything else looks fine. The Replicators return to the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
They've taken out the guards in the Chair Room.</blockquote>
<p>[They notice a display lighting.]
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
What are they doing?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett scrunches his face in concentration.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAWN</b>
</p><p>[Drones come out through a tube in the city. The three drones rise and then fall.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett concentrates.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAWN</b>
</p><p>[The drones go underwater and head underneath the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The room rocks from an explosion. Talus indicates some Replicators should go respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
They've hit the stardrive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
A search and destroy team is on their way to the Chair Room now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
Make sure they understand we need them alive.</blockquote>
<p>[Telus leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Beckett!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett fumbles to get out the chair and raise his sidearm, but by the team he positions himself, Teyla has been stunned, and Beckett is outnumbered. He slowly lowers his sidearm and kneels in surrender.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Okay, lads, easy. Easy.</blockquote>
<p>[Replicators grab Beckett and manhandle him and Teyla out of the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Weir finish as Replicators arrive. One grabs Weir as Ronon loses a fight with two others.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANOTHER ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay finish up and are instantly surrounded by Replicators.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And I was so sure we were gonna survive this one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Me too.</blockquote>
<p>[They surrender and are led away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard are thrown into a cell where the rest of the rescue team are.]
</p>
<blockquote>REPLICATOR<br />
Bring the prisoners from the other cell.</blockquote>
<p>[Some Replicators leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Everyone okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why aren't we dead yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Probably saving us for a little recreational mind-probing. Did everyone get the&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(quickly speaking)<br />
We completed our task.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So did we. In the nick of time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Just under the wire.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey and O'Neill are led into the cell. Talus stands at the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
Did you really think you'd be able to stop us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, of course we did. Why else would we be here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Colonel? Am I gonna have to fire you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, sir. I think you'll have that to look forward to when we get back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
I'm afraid your plan has been discovered, Colonel Sheppard. It is over.</blockquote>
<p>[Talus glances at Woolsey, and everyone stares at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(protesting)<br />
He put his hand in my forehead. How can you resist that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, I like to close my eyes and think of England.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
Mr. Woolsey informed us of everything we need to know. All of your C-4 has been removed from the emitters. I'm afraid they won't be destroyed when the <i>Daedalus</i> arrives&#8230;which should be in any moment. Your plan has failed.</blockquote>
<p>[Another Replicator holds out the C-4 they've collected. Weir looks disappointed.]
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Talus. The <i>Daedalus</i> is approaching the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
(over intercom)<br />
As expected. Activate the shield.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER, EARLIER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(snapping his fingers)<br />
C-4. How much do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A bunch. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's desperate&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, so are we.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We need to split into groups.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was gonna suggest that anyway. Why? What are you thinking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If we're gonna destroy these guys using Replicator disruptors, we have to hit them all at once. We'll probably only get a dozen or so shots off before they manage to figure out the frequency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, what, you gonna get 'em all to stand in one place at the same time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Clever, yes. Or we could figure out a way to send one massive blast through the city. Look, follow me.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS SHIELD EMITTER, EARLIER</b>
</p><p>[McKay is showing the inside of an emitter to the others, demonstrating while he speaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Atlantis has ten of these emitters with which it creates the city's shields. So, if we can interface the crystals from the disrupter weapons with those of the shield emitters, we should be able to trigger a massive anti-Replicator wave throughout the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, that's where splitting into teams comes in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly. Now, I need to show you how to do this, so listen carefully. You slide out the crystal tray, you take the crystal from the Replicator weapon, you place it in the third slot from the right. Third symbol from the left activates the crystal tray. Clear on that? Great.</blockquote>
<p>[While McKay speaks, he replaces the crystal and activates the tray.]
</p><p>[The team starts walking away from the emitter.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They are bound to find one of our groups working on the shield emitters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I already thought of that. That's what the C-4's for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We blow them up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. We feed them misinformation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right.<br />
(holding up an ARG)<br />
Once you guys have made all your alterations, avoid using your shiny new toys even if that means getting caught, okay?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG, EARLIER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If we plant charges in all ten of the shield emitters before the <i>Daedalus</i> arrives, that way when the Replicators try to activate the shield&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(realizing)<br />
The C-4 detonates, the <i>Daedalus</i> beams a warhead into the city, and we all get vaporized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
That sounds more like a Plan F, doesn't it?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ATLANTIS BRIG, EARLIER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay move away from the brig.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
General O'Neill didn't buy it, but I think Woolsey did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I did win a Sears drama festival award when I was a kid. Could have made it a career if I wanted to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wish you would've.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG, EARLIER</b>
</p><p>[Cetus and Talus again probe Woolsey's and O'Neill's minds.]
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
We need to get to the shield emitter stations. Remove the C-4 explosive you find there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Way to resist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I said I wasn't good at this!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG, PRESENT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
(over comm)<br />
Talus, the <i>Daedalus</i> is approaching the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />

<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OPERATIONS CENTER</b>
</p><p>[Cetus activates the shield.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The shield raises, and also sends an anti-replicator wave flowing down through the levels of the city. Everywhere replicators disintegrate, including those in the brig.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ha! It worked! I can't believe it worked!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(proudly)<br />
Rodney, amazing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it was-it was a group effort.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good old Plan D. Works every time. You guys stay here a sec.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon leave to investigate.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Excuse me, but what just happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We turned the shield into a giant Replicator weapon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I knew that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You knew?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, I've seen Carter crack enough codes to know that McKay was faking the door thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
He was? I bought it completely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe that was the point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Wait a minute, you-you used me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're alive, and you're welcome.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon reenters the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey, we're clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, we've gotta get to the Control Room and contact the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[The start leaving.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
You see, Richard? You were good for something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(mildly comforted)<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>

<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Atlantis? Is it Replicators?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
No, sir. It has Colonel Sheppard's authentication code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Open a channel.<br />
(into comm)<br />
Colonel, I'd like to believe this is you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it is. Authentication code Alpha Delta Charlie Niner Six.</blockquote>

That code is no longer valid, Colonel.</blockquote>

We're lowering the city's shields, Steven. You can send a team to come check us out if you need to. We'll explain everything.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Get a team of marines ready to beam down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />

</p><p>[Weir looks around the empty room. O'Neill enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Getting all settled in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Easily. Although their decorating..? Little bit spartan for my liking. But the Replicators did do a fine job on rebuilding Stargate Operations back to its original state. How about yourself? Do you check out okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Apparently I don't have any little tiny robots floating in my bloodstream, which is always nice to hear.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill and Weir share commiserating looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Huh! That it is. So what now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Oh, a jumper ride home to the SGC, followed by a hot shower, followed by a hot toddy, followed by&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I was thinking a&#8230;little more selfishly. What are the chances of my team staying here in Atlantis?</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Oh. Elizabeth, if it were up to me, I'd&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It is up to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Right.<br />
(after a pause)<br />
You can stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
You're probably still gonna have to get the rubber stamp from the IOA, but since you saved Woolsey's ass and you did a fair job on mine, I don't think that'll be a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say thank you very much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Hey, you came back to rescue me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm! Yes, we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Of course, next time, consider bringing Carter with you.</blockquote>
<p>[She smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Welcome home.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir is overcome with emotion and hugs O'Neill. O'Neill is taken aback at first, then hesitantly returns the hug.]
