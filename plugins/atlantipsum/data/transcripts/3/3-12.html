</p><p><b>END EXCERPTS</b>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies through the air.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard flies Zelenka and Ronon back to Atlantis.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well? How'd the camping go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, splendid. I was able to run several ground-penetrating radar tests.  You know, to test the dielectric permittivity of the region's subsurface.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(blankly)<br />
Sweet.<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
What about you? How was the hunting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(annoyed)<br />
If there was any game, it was all scared off by the noises his stupid machines made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I said I was sorry. It was necessary for the tests.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're the one who volunteered to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, if I do something like that again, shoot me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(low, to Sheppard)<br />
He was like this all night, you know. Very agitated. Had me scared.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He'll be alright. Get him home, get him a nice warm bath, a hot meal&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka sits up and stares out the window.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Where's Atlantis? It should be right in front of us.</blockquote>
<p>[There is only open ocean in front of them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, why isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Uh, I-I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is it cloaked?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, no, no. They would have radioed us about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So what are you saying? We're lost?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Wait-wait-wait-wait. Adjust your heading forty degrees south.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard complies.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The navigation system is off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I-I don't know. It could be any of a number of reasons, you know&#8212;clock drift, the fluctuations in the magnetosphere from the sunspots&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(pointing at the city in the distance)<br />
There it is.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka says something in Czech]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See? No harm, no foul.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks back at Ronon, who still sulks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You might wanna take Teyla up on her offer for meditation lessons. Looks like you could use a little unwinding&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sharply)<br />
Just land this thing!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S PRACTICE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits cross-legged in the room. Ronon sits similarly behind her. Both have their eyes closed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
&#8230;And then slowly exhale, allowing each breath to cleanse you, restoring your body and spirit. Feel your mind clearing, open to all that surrounds you&#8230;Embrace the silence.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon snores loudly. Teyla's eyes snap open.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[She turns around, looking at Ronon, who continues snoring. She appears quite annoyed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, NEAR CREW QUARTERS ATRIUM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla heads down steps and into the corridor, lost in her own thoughts. She stops when she sees a woman in a long flowing gown walking towards her.]
</p><p>[The woman looks directly at Teyla with an intense expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANTIAN WOMAN<br />
<i>Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sorry. I do not understand.</blockquote>
<p>[The woman walks right through Teyla like a ghost. Teyla freezes in shock, then looks everywhere. Nothing is around her.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM AND NEARBY CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Weir heads out of the Gate Room. McKay catches up to her and they walk quickly through the corridors side by side.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Elizabeth. Did you get my e-mail?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(sighing)<br />
Which e-mail? One of the seven today, or one of the eighteen yesterday?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know, I'm being unusually persistent about this, but, uh, that should only underscore its importance, yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We cannot keep all three ZPMs from the Replicator takeover, Rodney. We get one. Now, I don't know how to make it any clearer for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I felt if I could just, um, outline the reasons for keeping them. You know&#8212;bullet point, very brief.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It was twenty-six pages!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know, but if we hope to, uh, persuade Stargate Command &#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, so tell me. Who would you deprive of the other ZPMs? The Antarctic outpost?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, no, because they need it to power the chair to protect Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, how about the <i>Odyssey</i>, then? They're getting the other ZPM to help in their fight against the Ori. Rodney, we have enough power now to raise the shield, and cloak the city, and dial home. Please, can you start seeing the glass as half-full?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulantly)<br />
Well, you mean one-third full.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(annoyed)<br />
No more e-mails.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir turns away. McKay makes a face, then turns and walks away into the other direction.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S PRACTICE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla spar with the sticks. Teyla presses her advantage and hits Ronon hard with her body, twice. He struggles to stand up straight.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am sorry. You weren't expecting that?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon grimaces as Teyla smiles broadly, having gotten her revenge.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR CREW QUARTERS ATRIUM</b>
</p><p>[Workout over, Teyla and Ronon walk down the steps. Both are chuckling.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I was tired. It a long day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
To be honest, I &#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(interrupting)<br />
You don't care much for meditation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Never could sit still long enough for it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
All the more reason for you to consider&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She stops and stares down the corridor, frightened. The woman has returned, exactly as before. Ronon looks at Teyla in concern. He sees nothing in corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANTEAN WOMAN<br />
<i>Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That woman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What&#8230;woman?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANTEAN WOMAN<br />
<i>Speaks Ancient in a distorted voice.</i></blockquote>
<p>[Teyla moves quickly as if to get out of someone's way. Ronon still sees nothing, and Teyla notes it. Teyla starts to follow the woman. They reach the end of a passageway. The door opens to reveal a heavily burned man stumbling out. Teyla jumps back with a cry, startled. Ronon grabs her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey, hey&#8212;what's wrong?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks around but there is now nothing there: no burned man, no open door.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay looks out at the ocean with binoculars. He doesn't notice Sheppard come onto the balcony behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay puts down his binoculars, eventually realizing Sheppard is there.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey. How long have you been standing there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hour or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?! Why didn't you say anything? I feel like a&#8230;Oh. It's the kidding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What did you wanna show me?</blockquote>
<p>[He hands his binoculars to Sheppard, who looks through them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right there.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks where McKay indicates and only sees ocean.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Hmm!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All that&#8230;water!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
Just wait for it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sees a whale breach the surface.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's my friend. He's back.</blockquote>
<p>[Rodney and Sheppard smile at the site.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett scans Teyla. Ronon and Weir are nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The scan's clean. No sign of any physical abnormality.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, we've seen devices that mess with people's minds &#8212; caused them to hallucinate things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, but they've always had corresponding neural activity to indicate a problem. No, I'm afraid, for the moment anyway, there doesn't appear to be any physiological reasons for her hallucinations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Then why did she see what she saw?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't quite know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Many Ancestors died here recently. During the Replicator invasion, the crew of the <i>Tria</i> were all murdered. Perhaps they attempted to ascend but were prevented from fully doing so&#8212;trapped between this plane of existence and&#8230;the next.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You mean ghosts?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You ask me, it's too much meditation.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla glares at Ronon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Sheppard walk down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is she gonna be okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't know. Hopefully she just needs some rest. We've all been through quite a lot&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay exits a corridor and spots the pair approaching.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, I told you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, not you. I mean Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(insulted)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I mean, not that I don't wanna talk to you. Well, you can be a part of this conversation. In fact, I think you'll probably find it every bit as interesting as&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
What are you saying?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay holds up the display on his tablet computer showing a marine animal species.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Check it out. Found it in the Ancient database. They have a whole subsection on indigenous Lantean animal life. Did you know that there was a lobster-like crustacean down there the size of a Buick?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm! And&#8230;what is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's Rodney's whale friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, but not actually a whale. Whale-like, but not a mammal. It's a fish. It's a big, big fish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did the Ancients have a name for it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Flagecallus. I know, they were terrible at naming things. I-I've just, um, I've just called it "whale" for now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And why are you studying this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, 'cause he's out there right now, circling the city. Sheppard and I saw him. Probably the very same whale that saved me last year when I was trapped in that submerged jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought Zelenka and I saved you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you did&#8230;technically, but only after Sam led you to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Sam?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, it's the whale. I named him &#8212; after Sam&#8230;antha Carter. It's personal reasons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You named him after Samantha Carter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Well, Sam's a boy's name too.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard bites back further retort.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And how do you know he's a "he"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, because I cross-referenced the renderings in the database with the whale outside and, you'll see the males have a rather prominent&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts bringing up another display on his tablet.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(interrupting and looking away)<br />
Oh, it's okay, never mind. I'll take your word for it. I trust this little diversion isn't actually cutting into your work time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, no. No, of course not. No-no, I-I'm just, um, dabbling in my free time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, then, boys, dabble away!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard smiles at the whole exchange. Weir slaps Rodney on the arm and walks away. After a moment, Sheppard and McKay continue walking.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, these, uh, whales. Did the Ancients say they're good eating?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, you wouldn't!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I would.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla gets into bed. She hears the strange voices again. She gets up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla walks out into the corridor, once again spotting the woman in the white dress, who clearly looks afraid. She follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[The woman continues walking swiftly through the corridor. Teyla hurries to catch up.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla slows down as she realizes the woman is once again reaching a doorway. Again, it opens and the burned man stumbles out. The woman grabs to catch him from falling, then turns to Teyla, as if pleading for help.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANTEAN WOMAN<br />
<i>Screams Ancient in a distorted voice.</i></blockquote>
<p>[Teyla claps her hands over her ears from the high pitched screams.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla meets with Heightmeyer.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
You don't understand what the woman is saying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. I believe she is speaking in the Ancestral tongue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Mmm. You said she's afraid? Of the burned man?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. It is my sense that she's trying to&#8230;help him. Whatever it is she fears, I do not know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Did you try to talk to her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, but she seems unaware of me. It is as if I'm&#8230;not even there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
If these are apparitions, why do you think they're appearing to you?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shakes her head in ignorance, then chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Too much meditation.</blockquote>
<p>[Heightmeyer looks confused.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(shaking her head)<br />
Something Ronon said to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Oh. Well, there are those who believe that meditation is a way of opening a door to the spiritual world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If these are Ancestors trapped between planes of existence, perhaps they are trying to communicate something to me. Maybe they believe I can help them to move on.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Heightmeyer walks with Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
I don't know why she's experiencing these visions, but she's always been one to shoulder a lot of emotional responsibility. She may be carrying some guilt over what happened to the Ancients here recently.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, why? It certainly wasn't her fault.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
No, no, of course not, but somewhere deep inside her she may somehow feel complicit in the actions that led up to their murders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
I'll continue working with her and see if I can sort things out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. I'll make sure she gets some rest, even if it means taking her off the next mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Ugh, she does seem tired. She hasn't been sleeping well, and the last few days she's been complaining of headaches.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Huh, Doctor Beckett gave her a clean bill of health.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Well, we'll just keep an eye on her. Hopefully it'll all pass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Let's hope so. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Heightmeyer walks away. Weir goes to a doorway and passes her hand over the control to open it. The door opens and the burned man stands before her. Weir jumps, startled, looking around to see if anyone else also notices it. When she turns back, the burned man has disappeared.]
</p><p><b>LATER</b>
</p><p>[Along a different corridor, Heightmeyer, Teyla, and Weir walk together.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
So now both of you are seeing them? Why do you suppose that is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, that's why we've come to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps they believe that appearing to two people will increase the chance their message will be heard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If in fact, they are trying to communicate something to us&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Or maybe it's just the power of suggestion. It's been documented that when one person sees a ghost, it won't be long before others around them see it too. You said it yourself. You've all been through a lot recently. When's the last time you took a day off?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Teyla both sigh and exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Exactly. Have you seen any more apparitions?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Not recently.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
How are the headaches?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Still have them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Have you been able to sleep?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shakes her head negatively.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Perhaps Doctor Beckett can prescribe something for you.<br />
(glancing at Weir)<br />
For both of you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard joins McKay in his lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah. There you are. You are not gonna believe this. I've been monitoring Sam on the underwater scanner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stop calling him that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's creepy!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No it's not. Look, here he is, circling the city. He's been doing it for a while. Won't leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You didn't feed him, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No! Look, now if I widen the scan&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He does so. A sonar image shows two creatures outside the original range.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Another whale.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Probably the mother.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That guy's the size of a football field!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A <i>Canadian</i> football field.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So the first one was a baby.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, wanna take a closer look?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rushes out, and McKay follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters a jumper to find Zelenka already inside, running a diagnostic.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, Radek. Didn't know anyone was here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Do you need to use the jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Gonna check out some whales. Rodney's on his way. He's just taking some Dramamine but, uh&#8230;yeah, we can take another jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh-oh, just be careful. I'm not too sure if I've fixed the navigational glitch. Uh, the other jumpers might be affected as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we won't go far. We'll stay within sight of the city. Plus you'll be tracking us from the Control Room.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves to find another jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(calling after him)<br />
I will? Oh, yes, yes, I will. Did you say whales?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett takes some medicine out of the cabinet and turns to a waiting Weir and Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
These should help, but don't take them until you can have at least eight hours of uninterrupted rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Huh! Around here?! When does that ever happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, both Doctor Heightmeyer and I think you should take the time to make it happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right. Thank you, Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />

No. I-I mean, it doesn't sound like the language. The phonetic rhythm is similar, but I don't recognize any of the words.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's because it's gibberish. Well, to be more accurate, it's an attempt at mimicry. Look, it turns out the receiver is also a transmitter. The Ancients weren't just trying to learn the whales' language; they were attempting to teach them theirs by sending them auditory and visual signals. And while they were doing that, they experienced a traumatic moment which the whales then stored in their genetic memory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And that's what the images we've been seeing are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly. Reruns. Now, unfortunately, these whales are several generations removed from the incident, so they're, um, finding the language a bit of a tough go. It's kind of like trying to sing the lyrics to the macarena. You can sound out the words, but you have no idea what you're singing.</blockquote>

Ah. Interesting thing is, the Ancients seemed to be aware of the whales' deficient mimicry skills, and so they incorporated a kind of, um&#8230;acoustic language filter into the receiver. That's what's been taking me so long to figure out.</blockquote>

Meaning Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, I don't think so. "Adaris"?</blockquote>

What's "Adaris"?</blockquote>

I don't know.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Zelenka reports to Weir. They are both in the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
They've arrived &#8212; hundreds of them.</blockquote>
<p>[<i>The following conversation switches back and forth between the control room and Daedalus bridge.</i>]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Doctor Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go ahead, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
The sick patients have been beamed up. Our infirmary's filled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you. Unfortunately, more people are falling ill down here, so it's not really making much of a dent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Listen, whether these creatures are trying to communicate with you or not, at some point you're gonna have to deal with them. If they don't leave&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sure there are options besides killing them.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard rush in.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Sheppard and McKay)<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We figured it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, actually, I did most of the figuring, but, uh &#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
<i>Adaris</i> is a ship we found in the Ancient database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's an Ancient science vessel. About, uh, fifteen thousand years ago, it ran into some trouble. The entire crew was killed except for the pilot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The burned man. Teyla noticed the uniform. He was an Ancient pilot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which would explain the burns.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What does?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The ship got hit by a blast of radiation from the sun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a coronal mass ejection on a scale that dwarfs anything our sun has ever emitted. Apparently the sun in this solar system goes through an unusually turbulent sunspot cycle every fifteen thousand years or so. The Ancients have records of this class of CME occurring twice before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The ship was very close to the sun when it happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a massive prominence. It arced up and then collapsed when the magnetic field surrounding it weakened. We're talking an intense proton stream traveling at over four thousand kilometers per second.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Most of the crew was killed instantly but the pilot managed to open up a hyperspace window just as they were hit. He flew the ship back here, jumping ahead of the radiation wave just in time to warn everyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And the Ancients were able to raise the shield and extend it far enough to protect a large portion of the planet from the blast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So what are you telling me? This is going to happen soon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not soon. It's happening right now.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shows his laptop screen indicating the sun has already had a giant flare.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon comes to Teyla's bedside, pulling up a stool.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How're you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(weakly)<br />
I have felt better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You need any more pain medicine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. It does not seem to help any more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, just hang on. You're gonna be fine.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla keeps her eyes closed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla? Look at me.Look at me. You gotta hold on. Gotta teach me those, uh, meditation lessons.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla chuckles slightly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are hopeless.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(grinning)<br />
Yeah. I know.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla passes out.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla? Nurse.</blockquote>
<p>[A nurse approaches.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The magnetic field around it is already beginning to weaken. When that prominence collapses, the coronal mass ejection will occur. It'll erupt from a very small area &#8212; a mere pinprick in comparison to the total sun's surface. But it'll immediately begin to fan out. Within a few million miles, the blast wave will cut a swath wide enough to take out this entire planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How much time do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The prominence will collapse any moment now. After that, we have less than an hour before the radiation wave hits us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why didn't we notice this before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, because these things happen very quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
This kind of sunspot cycle is extremely chaotic, im-impossible to predict. No doubt that's what caused the glitch in the jumper's navigational systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not to mention our focus was on attack from the Wraith, not the sun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yet the whales were aware this was happening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, a lot of animals: whales, dolphins &#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Pigeons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
&#8230;are affected by the tiniest anomalies in the magnetosphere. It's as if their, uh, internal compasses are somehow, eh&#8230;Pigeons?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, homing pigeons. Er, I used to raise them before coming here. We used to consult solar charts before our pigeon races.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Pigeon races?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's still somewhat of a mystery how they're able to sense this trouble, but they do, often well before we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whatever. What are our options?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the Ancients were able to raise the shield and stretch it wide enough to protect a significant portion of the planet&#8212;attenuated, to be sure, more of a thin bubble&#8212;but it was able to, uh, block out enough of the radiation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
That's interesting, because we have found evidence of mass extinction on other parts of the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wow! Well, now we know what caused it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, so our shield is already activated. What else?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah. Small problem. The Ancients had three ZPMs at their disposal. We, as you know, only have one. Well, maybe I was so insistent on keeping them, because I too am able to sense trouble on the horizon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just like a pigeon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So, we just need to get the other two ZPMs back here&#8230;temporarily.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Not enough time. Look, the Odyssey's away from Earth. In the time it would take them to return, the blast wave would almost certainly have hit us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So how far can we extend the shield with one ZPM?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, enough to cover the city and perhaps a little bit of the ocean surrounding it, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We should evacuate, just to make sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, we can't gate to Earth. Look, we need the ZPM's power for the shields.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the Intergalactic Bridge?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The midway station isn't completed yet. We'd need to ferry people by jumper. Again, no time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, well, we'll send everyone to the Alpha Site and pick 'em up when this is over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think you understand. Look, the shield will protect the city from the initial blast, yes, but the entire ecosystem of this planet will be damaged beyond recovery for hundreds of years. Look, we're talking no plant life, which means no breathable air. We're&#8230;</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard carries Weir into the infirmary and places her on a gurney.]

<p>[He hurries over.]

(unconvincingly)<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Look at them. Seeking shelter underneath the umbrella of the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No-no-no-no-no-no-no. We don't have nearly enough power. Look, we can extend the shield twenty kilometers beyond the city, maybe. But it'll be dangerously thin and there's no way of knowing whether we can sustain it, especially in a radiation blast of fifty thousand REM.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard thinks quickly, getting an idea.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(keying radio)<br />
Colonel Caldwell, this is Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Go ahead, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
I think we have a plan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We do?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ZPM ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay are there. The ZPM is removed from its chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
This is not a good plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You realize just how close we'll have to get to the sun?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pretty damned close, I'm thinking.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pulls out a case with which to transport the ZPM.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, suicidally close. I mean, we'll be toast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's why we're taking the ZPM, to give the <i>Daedalus'</i>s shield an extra boost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, okay. You want to deflect the coronal mass ejection away from the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ah. Like an umbrella.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts drawing circles and lines on his tablet computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, listen to me. This. This is the sun; and this. This is us. A bolt of energy unlike anything you could possibly comprehend is gonna shoot out of the photosphere at a tremendous velocity, Okay? It is immediately gonna start fanning out, like so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatiently)<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which means that we will have to be really close to the surface of the sun if we wanna intercept that stream and deflect it before it can start spreading out.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances up from where he is working.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, I don't think you do. I don't think you fully grasp the reality of just how damned hot it gets that close to the surface of the sun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's why we're taking a ZPM&#8212;to strengthen the shields.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
From the blast wave, yes. But even with the shields at that strength, the-the build-up of residual heat behind it could cause serious problems for the <i>Daedalus</i>, and everyone inside it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Could." Could cause.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Tell me, if this is such a great plan, why didn't the Ancients do it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They were in the middle of a war! They probably didn't have a ship available at the time. And, like you said, they had three ZPMs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
