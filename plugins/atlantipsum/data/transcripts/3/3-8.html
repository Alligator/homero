<p><b>INT&#8212;LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Toys and stuffed animals are scattered everywhere. Four year old Madison plays with a train set. Jeanie is crouched near her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
The princess is going to play.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Where's the princess? Where's the princess in the tower?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Right there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Which one? Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Put this one&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie starts moving the train while Madison moves a dragon.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
This is how they get around, right? Chugga-chugga. Chugga-chugga.</blockquote>
<p>[Madison puts the dragon in a building and starts pushing the train herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Go inside the train. Choo choo. Choo choo. Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie watches the train go over the bridge in the playset. Inspiration hits her. She pulls off a picture of a house from Madison's drawing pad and then starts to write in finger paints.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;FOYER, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Miller enters the home and puts down his briefcase.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[He sees Madison standing transfixed at the edge of the living room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Madison?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Madison doesn't answer, so he goes over and crouches next to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Honey?</blockquote>
<p>[He turns and looks at what Madison is staring at. The living room is scattered with pages of filled with finger painted physics equations. His wife is in the center of them, still writing, oblivious to all.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Hi&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie starts.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh! Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
So&#8230;how was your day?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie looks around the room at all her drawings, seeming to notice them for the first time.]
</p><p>EXT&#8212;MILLER HOME, VANCOUVER, B.C., CANADA, NIGHT
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MASTER BEDROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Miller and Jeanie get ready for bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Send it to Graeme Peel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Graeme Peel has better things to do than to do than look over my nonsensical scribblings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Well, they didn't look nonsensical to me.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie gives him a look. He grins.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Okay, fine, they did. But I'm an English major. What the hell do I know? Send it. What have you got to lose.</blockquote>
<p>[She kisses him.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Good night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
G'Nite.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn out the lights, but Jeanie lies with her eyes wide open.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KITCHEN, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Jeanie sits at the table refining the calculations with pen and paper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Miller juggles some beverages into the living room, where Jeanie and Madison play by the train table. There is a knock at the door. Jeanie gets up to answer it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;FOYER, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[She opens the door to find Carter and two Air Force officers standing outside. All are in Class A uniform.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(smiling)<br />
Jean Miller?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(cautiously)<br />
Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter of the United States Air Force.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Did you send a math proof to Professor Graeme Peel of the California Institute of Technology?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(nervous)<br />
Was I not supposed to?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SCIENCE LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka work on their laptops. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry to interrupt, kids, but you need to pack your toothbrush. Head back to Earth.</blockquote>
<p>[He points to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I do? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Carter needs help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(preening)<br />
Ah. With what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Your sister.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's expression turns serious.]
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter enters to greet McKay coming through the wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Welcome back to Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes. What has my sister done?</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(dryly)<br />
Good to see you too, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatient)<br />
Greetings, salutations, pleasantries&#8230;what's she done?</blockquote>
<p>[He keeps walking out of the room, taking a quick look at her backside. Glaring, Carter follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[The remains of a sandwich sit nearby while McKay reads over the proof. Carter paces, snapping her fingers and looking bored. She leans over his shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I thought that&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He holds up a finger to silence her. He finishes reading and sits back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Well, it's certainly some&#8230;uh&#8230;very interesting stuff. But uh, huh, it can't be her work. I mean, she's been out of the game for years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
"The game?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm, yes. She hasn't published a single theoretical physics paper in, like, four years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh. That game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. She was on the fast track to some, uh, pretty exciting grants, doing some interesting work. I mean, she was no me, of course. But, uh, she was at least a "you."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(unimpressed)<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. Anyway&#8230;she got herself knocked up by some&#8230;"English major", and her priorities shifted overnight. Tried to talk some sense into her, but, uh, she's a tad on the stubborn side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
When was the last time you spoke to her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm, four years, maybe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Four years?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Not that I didn't check to see if she'd published!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter huffs in disbelief.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You realize what this proof means, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chuckles)<br />
Yes, well, if the math checks out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh I've been over it. It checks out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, well, no offense, blue eyes, but, um, I'd like a little more time with it, myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(firmly)<br />
It checks out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(jealous)<br />
Aw, and she said it just came to her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah. She was playing with her kid, and she got a notion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A notion. That is just beautiful. She's gonna love this&#8230;wait, you didn't tell her I've been trying to prove something like this myself, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Not exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, good. Because she would just&#8230;wait a minute. Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
See, that's part of the reason I asked you here. She's been cleared by the Pentagon, but she refuses to sign the confidentiality agreement. She says she wants nothing to do with us. To be honest, she's been a bit of a pain in the ass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Well, forget her, then. I mean, she's made her choice, we'll just have to you and I figure out how to implement it on our own. Let's see&#8230;Now, upon first glance, there are certainly some&#8230;missing pieces that aren't exactly spelled out in the proof, but um&#8230;What?</blockquote>
<p>[While he's been speaking, McKay shifts more uncomfortably under Carter's steady gaze.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You and I both know this would go a lot faster if your sister were on board.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what do you want me to do? She's not gonna listen to me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You're her brother!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;FOYER, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[There is a knock at the door. Jeanie answers to find McKay standing there with a bouquet of flowers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(surprised)<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Long time no see?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
To say the least.</blockquote>
<p>[There is an awkward silence.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aren't you going to invite me in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Why are you here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I can't just stop by, say hi to my little sister?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Well, we haven't spoken in four years, and you've never done anything like this! So&#8230;no, you can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I've been kind of&#8230;busy&#8230;with work&#8230;you know, doing a lot of traveling, and such, and I-I was called back on business, so um&#8230;I was in town&#8230;and-and I thought I'd um&#8230;you know, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He holds out the flowers.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(suspicious)<br />
Wait a second.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You're not here because of the physics proof, are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
What? No. No-no I-I mean, I'm sure that's part of the reason why I'm here, but, uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You work for the U.S. government?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No! No, I work for a multi-national&#8230;er, oversight advisory that, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You know what? I don't care. I already told that-that colonel person that I don't want anything to do with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do you have any idea what you've written?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
A math proof. Some-some theoretical physics. I am willing to wager it has no practical application at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll take that action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just sign the damn agreement!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
No! Getting all proprietary about our research and-and ideas is everything that's wrong with science today.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here we go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Do you know that one fifth of our genes, the very building blocks of our being, have been patented by major pharmaceutical corporations? One fifth! If there's any benefit at all to what I've written, it's that it'll spark an idea in someone else. I am not going to sign away my rights, least of all to the U.S. military.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But it has sparked an idea in someone. A big one!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah! Can't tell you. Not until you sign the agreement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I'm not signing the agreement until you tell me.</blockquote>
<p>[Miller comes down the hall, carrying Madison.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Is everything okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Look who showed up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<p>[Miller looks at McKay without recognition.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
It's&#8230;my brother.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Oh, right! Hey.</blockquote>
<p>[Miller puts down his daughter. Madison comes over and hugs McKay's legs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
Uh, hello, little one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Did you bring me a present?</blockquote>
<p>[Miller and Jeanie laugh. Jeanie pulls Madison away.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(scolding)<br />
Madison!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? No. I didn't know that was a rule.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
It is!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I guess I broke that rule.</blockquote>
<p>[Madison giggles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Uh, I just made some dinner. Would you care to join us?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie turns and glares at Miller.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, that would be great, exactly. I'm starving. You have no idea what time zone I just came from.</blockquote>
<p>[Miller leads Madison into the kitchen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Well, I, uh, sure hope you like tofu chicken.</blockquote>
<p>[He chuckles, McKay joins in half-heartedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low, to Jeanie)<br />
I sure hope he's kidding.</blockquote>
<p>[He passes off the flowers to Jeanie and enters. Jeanie sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KITCHEN, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Jeanie clear plates from the dining room and enter the kitchen.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Not a fan of vegetarian cuisine, eh?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay carries his mostly full plate in.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pitifully)<br />
Hmm, yes, well&#8230;I suppose I was just in the mood for, um, well&#8230;food.</blockquote>
<p>[Miller enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
I'll give Maddie her bath. You two catch up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Okay, hon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Hey, pop your head in before you leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervous)<br />
What? Uh, why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Children like to, uh, say goodbye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh! The, uh&#8230;uh&#8230;sure. Sure.</blockquote>
<p>[Miller leaves. McKay scrapes his plate into the trash.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Boy, uh, Madison's sure grown, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(caustically)<br />
Since she was born? Yeah, yeah she has.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, look I don't want to waste any more of your time. You-you need to come with me right now! Your-your proof could lead to something&#8230;groundbreaking!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
How long would I be gone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well it's like, a couple months, tops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(laughs in disbelief)<br />
A couple of months?! Are you joking? I&#8212;Madison has her first ballet recital next Tuesday.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's four. How good could she possibly be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
That's not the point!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, she's not gonna remember you not being there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I'll remember me not being there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is bigger than your-your "responsibilities."</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Okay, we've, uh, we've had this conversation before. Uh, you belittle my choices, I get furious at you, and we don't talk for four years. I'm not all that anxious to do that again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is not what dad would've wanted.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie gasps in outrage.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, he would've wanted us working together, side by side, toppling problems, and-and sharing credit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh, uh, you-you share credit now, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is important, Jeanie. I mean, it's much more important than you could ever imagine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
For you, I am sure it is. But this, me being here, this is important for me. Why can't you accept that?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, you leave me no choice.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches into his pocket and walks over to Jeanie.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just give me your hand.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie clutches both hands to herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Please, just give me your hand.</blockquote>
<p>[She reaches out then pulls her hand back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Will you just&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie finally holds out her hand. McKay grasps it and presses the controller in his other hand.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HERMIOD'S LAB, <i>DAEDALUS</i></b>
</p><p>[McKay and Jeanie beam into the room. Carter is already there, working the Asgard controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(frightened)<br />
Uh, okay. Wha-what the hell just happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's okay. You're perfectly safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(still upset)<br />
Uh, I don't feel perfectly safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you've just been teleported to an interstellar vessel in orbit above the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Please. Teleportation is about as likely as time travel.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay exchange awkward looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm, yes, well&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns Jeanie around to have her look out the window. She sees Earth below her.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh&#8230;my.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Is-is that&#8230;? Why aren't we weightless?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Artificial gravity. And yes, that is North America, and you are in geosynchronous orbit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We work for something called the Stargate Program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, it's a device that, uh, creates stable artificial wormholes that allows us to travel between other planets, even&#8230;other galaxies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What have you gotten yourself involved in here, Meredith?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay groans. Carter turns to him, alert.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Meredith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a long story.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
It's his name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(fighting not to laugh)<br />
Your name is Meredith McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's Meredith Rodney McKay, yes. But I prefer to go by "Rodney." Look, can we just stick to the point here? Look out the window&#8212;much more interesting than my name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Your name is Meredith?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie finally turns away from the window and walks around, gesturing wildly.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
So, this-this is like a&#8230;like a spaceship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
This is a U.S. Air Force vessel called the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Your equation has real world applications I'm certain you've never even considered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You see, there are some&#8230;very bad creatures out there that want nothing more but to destroy this planet and everything that you hold dear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Uh, did you say "creatures"? Like&#8230;like alien creatures?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie walks back over to the window.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, the work we could do is important, Jeanie. Not just to you or me, but to every living being down there, and that includes Madison and, um,&#8230;uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Kaleb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Kaleb, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We can't do this without you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let's not go overboard. I mean, she'd be an asset, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(admonishing)<br />
McKay!<br />
(to Jeanie)<br />
So what do you say, Mrs. Miller?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jeanie&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Look, it's just a lot to take in right now, okay? Just give me a second, Mer.</blockquote>
<p>[She stares out the window for a few moments.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
So, somewhere down there, my husband is giving my daughter a bath.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay smile.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MASTER BEDROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Miller awakens in bed. He looks over to see Jeanie sitting at the edge of the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
You have to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<p>[She sighs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> leaves Earth orbit and jumps into hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, <i>DAEDALUS</i></b>
</p><p>[McKay and Jeanie walk down the corridor, passing other personnel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What did you tell Kaleb?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
The truth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?! Do you have any idea what "non-disclosure" means?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Just because we don't keep secrets from each other doesn't mean we're incapable of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what did he say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(chuckles)<br />
Um, he's concerned that me telling him will get him assassinated.<br />
(notices her brother not laughing)<br />

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, I thought I could at least help you get Jeanie up to speed before you guys are out of comm range. About a year ago, your brother came across an abandoned alien experiment called Project Arcturus. It was an attempt to generate zero point energy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
That would be virtually limitless power! What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A slight problem. It was the creation of exotic particles in the containment field.</blockquote>

He destroyed a solar system.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Your brother along with many others has been trying to figure out a way to draw zero point energy from a parallel space-time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which would get us around the whole problem of the creation of dangerous exotic particles in our own space-time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
And my theory is about bridging universes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Exactly. Yeah, we're hoping to use your proof as a theoretical basis for building a bridge from a parallel space-time to ours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Uh, the energy you'd need would be enormous to the point of absurd.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Absurd we can do. We have something called a zero point module which essentially does what we're attempting on a smaller scale&#8212;extract energy from subspace time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
So&#8230;subspace is real?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You're flying in it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh. Aren't you worried about the exotic particles crossing back over my bridge?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, that's the beauty of your theory. It should not only allow us to build a bridge, it should also allow us to manage the flow rate of energy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What about the parallel universe? Aren't you just shifting the exotic particle problem to their side?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Potentially. But when you consider that the number of possible parallel universes that we could access borders on the infinite, the odds of us choosing at random one that's inhabited are&#8230;astronomically slim.</blockquote>

Huh. Wow.</blockquote>

<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters and hears laughter. He moves determinedly to his team's table, where all are laughing with Rod and Jeanie.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the hell is this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, sleepyhead!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
I had a breakfast date with Jeanie. I guess it just kind of ballooned into a group affair. Look, sit down. We're tracing back our lives, trying to find the little differences between our pasts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rod is an honorary member of the Athosian Council.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
And is godfather to his niece and nephews.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well how wonderful for him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Well, it's easier for me. Our Earth has a ZPM too, so it makes the back and forth a lot simpler.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Doctors McKay, please report to the containment chamber. Doctors McKay&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY AND ROD<br />
Excuse me.</blockquote>
<p>[Both they and Jeanie start to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey, uh, Rod! Are we still on to spar later?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Absolutely!</blockquote>
<p>[Rod and Ronon exchange a complicated handshake.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD AND RONON<br />
Boh!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTAINMENT CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[The containment chamber is active. McKay rushes past Zelenka to the control panel. Rod and Jeanie are behind.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean you started it up again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Shutting the experiment down only made things worse for us, not better. The matter bridge is still active, but we are not drawing any power, creating pressure, like a&#8212;a dam. If we didn't turn it on again, it could have resulted in a catastrophic overloaded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Oh&#8230;we should've thought of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(accusingly)<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Don't look at me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, so you're willing to take all of the credit, but none of the blame, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I never wanted all the credit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
(to Jeanie)<br />
No one is blaming you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(with pointed look at McKay)<br />
Oh really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Look, this is just a temporary solution. The Zelenka in my space-time estimates that there is at least a week and a half before the tear expands as far as the city&#8230;my city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What will happen when it does?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Zelenka each take on stricken looks of realization.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Well, imagine what would happen if you just threw the laws of physics out the window.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Entropy&#8230;chaos.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Mmm. Worst case scenario, the entropy expands as far as the subspace layers, underneath our space-time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It could travel almost instantaneously. I mean, your universe could just flash out of existence!</blockquote>
<p>[He snaps his fingers.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
We need to mend that tear before it become irreparable. Now, I have some thoughts. Is there a place we can go to work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, yes. Of course. Follow me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Oh! Jeanie, we could use your help.</blockquote>
<p>[He taps her on the arm. She smiles and follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Rod stand by a work station.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Do you mind running up these power requirements?</blockquote>
<p>[He hands McKay a disk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Done.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks away with the disk, looking annoyed. A perplexed Rod watches him go. McKay turns back, and Rod turns back to the computer. McKay heads over to where Jeanie's working.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What were you doing having breakfast with him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I don't often meet people from another universe. I found myself curiously interested.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I don't want you hanging around with him any more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I am your real brother.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
In what sense?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You haven't been a brother to me since I quit school.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffs)<br />
You were making an incredible mistake. I was just trying to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(interrupting)<br />
You were trying to control my life, Mer. I-I disagreed with you. I still do! And wh-what, because of that, you stopped being my brother?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I never stopped being your brother!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
We haven't talked in four years!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't put all that on me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
It is all on you! I had no way of getting in touch with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was doing top secret research in another galaxy!</blockquote>
<p>[Both turn to see if their raised voices have attracted Rod's attention. Rod continues to work on the computer, obviously trying not to listen&#8230;and not succeeding. They both lower their voices.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You could've sent me a message. You know, called me on my birthday, at-at Christmas. Once a year&#8230;that's all I would've needed. Just-just a: "hi, how are you? Are you happy? Are you okay?" That would've been enough, but you didn't even do that. No, no. I was wrong, and you were right, so what? I was not worth talking to?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(hurt, defensive)<br />
It wasn't like that at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You don't like me talking to Rod because it makes you realize how bad a brother you've really been.</blockquote>
<p>[Rod stiffens and turns to the pair, notably interrupting the argument.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
(with false brightness)<br />
Hey! You guys got something over there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(upset)<br />
No. We don't.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[McKay paces while Sheppard sits on his bed and cleans his golf clubs with a toothbrush.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's slowing me down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really? I thought two of you would have sped things up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, he's not me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know he's not the same person, trust me. I'm just saying, he's a genius too, isn't he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmph. Unless he's lying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(skeptical)<br />
About what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What if the people on his Atlantis were sick of him messing up all the time, huh? So when it came time to send some stooge on a one-way ticket to another universe, there was only one guy they could do without.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mm, say what you want, I know what this is about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, really, Mister Mensa in a parallel universe, what is this all about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think Jeanie likes him more than you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?! That's crazy! That's&#8230;that's&#8230;that's possibly true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(smiling in agreement)<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Jeanie and I drifted apart. I mean, that happens, I mean, it wasn't done maliciously. Do I have regrets? Yes, of course I do. But who doesn't? I mean, you know, I'm not very good at saying I'm sorry, or that-or that I'm wrong, you know, possibly because it happens so rarely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(groaning in not-quite agreement)<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So I didn't call, or write, and when I realized that four years had gone by, it was just a&#8230;you're right! Of course, you're right. I mean, she has every reason to hate me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't say she hates you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, she should!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks up and shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if you insist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well then, fair enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Doctor McKay to the containment chamber. Doctor McKay&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distractedly to Sheppard)<br />
Good talk. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves Sheppard swinging his golf club and looking a bit perplexed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTAINMENT CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay joins Jeanie, Zelenka, and Rod in the containment chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Great, he's here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, I set up a way to pick up transmissions inside the containment chamber should Rod's universe try to contact us. We, of course, still have no way of communicating with them, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatiently)<br />
They sent us a message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Yeah. Apparently their exotic particle problem is spinning out of control much faster than they'd anticipated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, boy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
But they have a solution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They do? That's great!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Well, not really. Their solution would not only destroy Atlantis, but tear a hole in the fabric of&#8230;this universe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh boy.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Jeanie, Rod, Sheppard, and Weir are all in the briefing room. Computer displays show graphics depicting the connection between both universes.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Now, I'm not saying that their attempt would be successful. But&#8230;if it was, it would flood the exotic particles that are being created on their side into this space-time all at once.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And that would, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Be&#8230;bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. I got that, but, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How bad?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, to be honest, the science gets extremely complicated. But, um, "simply put", the tear will eventually swallow up the entire galaxy, possibly the universe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So&#8230;very bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well I think we can all agree that that would be bad, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Their plan will take six hours to implement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I suggest we do something before that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Well, we have an idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, Jeanie has an idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(surprised)<br />
Uh, we think we can collapse the bridge with a massive burst of energy from this side.</blockquote>
<p>[She types on her laptop and the graphic display demonstrates her idea.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
And stop the creation of exotic particles on the other side by doing so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How massive a burst are we talking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everything we've got. I mean, enough to severely deplete our ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(sighing)<br />
So instead of creating a new powerful energy source, we'll be sacrificing the one we already have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. We'd still be able to dial Earth, but, uh, much less frequently, of course. And let's just say, I wouldn't be around here if the Wraith show up.</blockquote>
<p>[Rod gives a rueful chuckle of agreement.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't see that we have a choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right. Do it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTAINMENT CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka turns from Jeanie to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Doctor Weir gave the okay for this?</blockquote>

You'd rather the universe was destroyed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(after a pause)<br />
Not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Rodney, talk to you for a second?</blockquote>
<p>[Rod and McKay move to a more private area of the lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Look, the <i>Daedalus</i> is still in orbit. I thought, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know what you're going to say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
If I can beam into the&#8230;energy stream, protected by my personal force field&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You'd be transported back to your own universe. I know, I didn't bring it up before because if it doesn't work&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Well, I'm willing to take that risk. I've already requested the <i>Daedalus</i> to execute the transport to the coordinates inside the chamber on your mark. That is, if you're willing to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(protesting)<br />
Everyone loves you here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Yeah, but it's not home! Look, what, my Sheppard is a know-it-all, my Teyla is hard to talk to, and-and my Ronon is&#8230;well, actually, those two are pretty similar.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gives a small laugh.]
</p>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is that, for all their faults, they're my team! My place is with them. Besides, they're not looking for another McKay around here, they already have one!</blockquote>
<p>[He slaps McKay on the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's just a lesser model, hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
I envy you. You say exactly what's on your mind, no matter how it makes you look. I can only imagine the freedom you must have, not caring if people like you or not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. People don't like me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
Trust me, you've got it great here. Now, I've made some calculations. When the readings reach the levels I've indicated, you'll know whether or not I made it home.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands McKay his handheld computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I guess you just to, um, click your heels together, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
(smiling)<br />
Good luck, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs McKay's hand and gives a complicated handshake.]
</p>

Hey, I tried to talk him out of it, but you know&#8230;Rod.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROD<br />
(keying intercom)<br />
Hermiod, ready when you are.<br />
(to everyone)<br />
Guess there's nothing left to say but&#8230;there's no place like home.</blockquote>
<p>[Rod is beamed away. They all turn back to the control station.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right, all in the green. Ready for forced power output.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, and&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts towards the master control, then pauses and turns to his sister.]
</p>

Yeah&#8230;yeah&#8230;sure.</blockquote>
<p>[She presses the button. The chamber activates.]

I've never really been the&#8230;poster child for that kind of sentiment. But, when-when one's contemplating one's own demise, one tends to see things&#8230;more clearly. I really do wish you the best, you know? And I'm sorry we weren't closer. Perhaps, um&#8230;if by chance I make it out of this, perhaps one day we can be. And I would like that.

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Um, well, she wasn't too happy about the whole&#8230;"killing-the-ZPM". But, um, you know, in the grand scheme of things, we did prevent the destruction of the universe, so&#8230;you know&#8230;not fired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[There is another awkward silence.]

Yeah, Mer. I am. I really am.</blockquote>
<p>[They break away, but still remain standing close to each other.]

That's good. We found him a little, uh, creepy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, I can't stand people who are nice all the time. It makes me feel like they're trying to hide something.</blockquote>
