</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies over the fields and forests of an alien world.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sneezes and coughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(hoarsely)<br />It's nothing, just a cold. No big deal. It's just annoying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Talk about annoying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what we're doing, Rodney. The MALP detected life signs. We have to check it out. That's the protocol.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I am just saying that identifying potential space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you that eager to return to Earth, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This isn't just about me. It is about the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently&#8230;and whenever I want to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How's that work again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(turning in his chair back to Ronon, enthusiastic)<br />Okay, once we've seeded enough Stargates across the void between Pegasus and the Milky Way, we'll be able to take a jumper from one to the other to the other till we reach the other side. That way we won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the <i>Daedalus</i>, and travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to thirty minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns back to face forward, very proud.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Very clever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smugly)<br />Yes.<br />
(more reluctantly)<br />It was Samantha Carter's idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Several brightly dressed people smile and greet Sheppard's team warmly as they enter the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low, to team)<br />Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and&#8230;get out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is distracted by two particularly attractive young women who smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>WILLA<br />
Fair day to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Willa)<br />Fair day to you.<br />
(to McKay, distracted)<br />Nothing here. We should probably go.</blockquote>
<p>[They watch another attractive young woman walk by, smiling at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted)<br />Eh, it probably wouldn't hurt to, uh, make contact with the locals though, no?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ronon exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no. When you're right, you're right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, well we're here now, and uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[A man with a wide grin yells from the length of the street.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Hello! Hello, new people! Why didn't anybody tell me the new people were here yet!</blockquote>
<p>[Willa embraces Lucius with a wide smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>WILLA<br />
Lucius, I've missed you!</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius returns the hug distractedly, not breaking stride as he approaches the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh please. Well, I was just out for a walk. Have you met the new people yet?</blockquote>
<p>[Willa shakes her head negatively as Lucius arrives in front of the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We just got here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh, great! Great! Then I haven't missed anything. I hate missing things. Have you met my wife, Willa? Isn't she gorgeous?<br />
(pointing to other beautiful women behind them)<br />My other wives are just making lunch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELEEN<br />
Fair day, Lucius!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Hello, sweetheart.<br />
(blows her a kiss)<br />I love ya. I love ya.<br />
(waves to villagers)<br />Fair day, everybody.</blockquote>
<p>[The team exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGERS<br />
Fair day, Lucius.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />I'm&#8230;John&#8230;Sheppard. Rodney McKay, Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures to his teammates in turn, who nod to Lucius in greeting. Lucius's eyes light on Teyla. He pushes Willa aside to get closer to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Teyla. And you are from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(cautiously)<br />Athos.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(seductively)<br />Athos. Yeah, Athos. I've never been there. Sounds nice. Is it nice?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(unamused)<br />Until it was culled by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh, I hate them. What do you say you and me get together, we have some lunch, we talk about this, huh? Maybe have some wine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(piqued)<br />We don't even know your name.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius turns to McKay. He and the villagers start to laugh as if McKay said something hilarious.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're serious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WILLA<br />
(shocked)<br />You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELEEN<br />
Well everyone knows.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WILLA<br />
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(with mock humility)<br />Aw, people just say that. I mean, you can't prove it until you've met everybody, am I right? Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(diplomatically)<br />Well then&#8230;Lucius, we're glad we met you.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius leans closer to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
And if you aren't yet, you will be! Come on! Let's have some lunch, huh? Everybody has to eat. Right? Come on, right this way, please. Please.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius's wives escort McKay and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(gesturing to Teyla and Ronon)<br />After you, please.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ronon follow the others, looking back curiously at Lucius. He remains behind, smiling and waving at the other villagers.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Fair day. Fair day. Fair day.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a small flask out of his jacket and drinks a large swallow, wincing at the taste.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Here I come!</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Several villagers smile and watch as Lucius and the team enjoy a meal in the center of town.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I love architecture. It's all a mystery to me, really, but, heh heh, it hasn't stopped me from trying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(bored)<br />I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(low, to Sheppard)<br />Is she taken, yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sharply)<br />No! Nor does he nor anyone else speak for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh yeah! Yeah, you are definitely wife material. You gotta love a woman with spirit. And a great body.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rubs his hand over his mouth to hide his expression. Teyla turns with a look that could kill.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Excuse me, um, Lucius. Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but, uh, what is it exactly about you&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Ah-ah. I know what you are going to say, so you don't even have to ask. I have gifts.</blockquote>
<p>[The team exchange skeptical and amused looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are those, uh&#8230;gifts?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Exploration. Alchemy. Medicine. I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sneezes.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
See, I could take care of that just&#8230;<br />
(snaps his fingers)<br />like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ah, it's just a cold.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Nevertheless, I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(deadpan)<br />That's impressive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(shrugging)<br />You get used to it. We'll do a trade. So&#8230;where you all from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No place in particular. We move around a lot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
In that wonderful machine of yours. Yeah, I saw it. I was on a walk, I look up, and-and I heard&#8230;somebody said that-that you flew through the ancestral ring?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shakes his head dismissively.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, that was us!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla glares at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
How does it fly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's complicated. One has to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(interrupting)<br />I mean, where do you get a machine like that? I-it I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel. Can I get one? Are they hard to fly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes. They are hard to fly, and&#8230;no, you can't have one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(insistent)<br />But I want one. Please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers begin to murmur in dismay.]
</p>
<blockquote>WILLA<br />
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or perhaps not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(insulted)<br />What? You come all this way, you don't even want to do a trade? Look, it doesn't even have to be the ship. Forget the ship. I don't even want the ship. Okay? You gotta have some other stuff that you want to trade, right? Okay? Like-like&#8230;how do you get your hair to go like that?</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius looks expectantly at Sheppard. Sheppard appears nonplussed for a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lunch was great&#8230;but I just realized we're running late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
For what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For that important thing!</blockquote>
<p>[He rises, the others follow suit.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes! Um, as much as we would love to stay, we really must go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
No, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to go. You just got here, come on! Come on! We haven't even had the second course. Please! I want-I want you to see some of my medicines.<br />
(to Willa)<br />Go get the ointments, the good ones. Go! Run! Go!</blockquote>
<p>[She runs to get his wares.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Another time, Lucius. We gotta go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(in a tantrum)<br />No. No, I don't want you to leave!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team finds their path blocked by the villagers, who close in at Lucius's words. They turn back to Lucius.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Okay, okay, okay. All right. Let them go. We're all friends here, right?</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers break apart, letting the team pass.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tell you, what. As soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come, see what you have to offer. <i>Then</i> we'll talk about trade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(hopeful)<br />Later today, maybe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I'll have everything ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(calling after them)<br />You won't be disappointed!</blockquote>
<p>[The team leaves. Lucius smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Nice people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGERS<br />
(in agreement)<br />Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir walks with Sheppard and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think the word we're looking for is, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Obnoxious? Unctuous?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, either one of those works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sounds like a snake oil salesman to me, but&#8230;might be worth having Beckett check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer pretty quickly. So, it's back out to scout for gates?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />Yes! Right away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not a race, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LUCIUS'S APOTHECARY SHOP</b>
</p><p>[Lucius leads Beckett around his shop.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet on my walks, but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds. I have to confess, I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(skeptical)<br />Every single one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, every one in town. The sick have been cured, the lame can walk again&#8230;well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say: "Thank you, Lucius. You have cured me. You are a wise and kind man."</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(humoring him)<br />Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Young, old&#8230; women&#8230; Do you like women, Doctor Beckett?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What? Yes, of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up around the square just waiting to be with you. You know what I mean when I say "be with you", right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(dryly)<br />I think so, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I will trade you that potion, for what you are holding in your bag&#8230;right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
My medical kit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(nodding)<br />Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But I thought you cured every known ailment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Every known ailment in town. I added that, remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, it is tempting. But I'm afraid, uh, I couldn't do that, Lucius, sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(chuckling)<br />Not yet, anyway, huh? Come on, you must be starving. I have a great meal lined up for us.</blockquote>
<p>[Looking exasperated, Beckett follows him out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir enters, and heads to where Zelenka, McKay, and Sheppard are.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How did the scout go?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard coughs hoarsely several times.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we found an unused 'gate in orbit over M3R-428.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
One lousy 'gate. We're never going to meet our quota at this rate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What quota?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My quota.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
<i>Daedalus</i> is still under repair anyway, Rodney. We won't be able to harvest 'gates till it can fly.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay crosses his arms and pouts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, he hasn't returned yet. He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay a little longer. Apparently, he's found something of interest.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay scoffs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE SQUARE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lucius sits telling stories to all the villagers, who sit spellbound by his tales.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
The baby was frozen solid&#8212;like a statue. Like a frozen statue. It must've been in the water for I don't know, what must&#8212;it seemed like an eternity. I didn't know what to do. And I was a kid myself. I take the baby, and I open my coat, and I tuck the baby inside, and I start stroking the baby's back&#8230;gently. Now, I don't know whether it was warmth of my body, or the steady insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again. But beat it did.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett is just as enthralled as the other villagers. They all gasp in wonder.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
And a cry arose, piercing the cold night air, as if to say&#8230;I am alive!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett starts the applause.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(laughing in delight)<br />Oh! Astonishing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
And that baby&#8230;that baby&#8230;grew up to be&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius gestures to the side. Beckett sees a woman pouring a tankard.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That beautiful young lady?</blockquote>
<p>[She smiles at Beckett's compliment.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
No, no, no, not her. Behind her.</blockquote>
<p>[The woman leaves with her tray of tankards. A young man turns a spit over the fire. He obviously is brain damaged.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Uh, maybe a little brain damage, but just a little. But the story is true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(enraptured)<br />And thank you for sharing it with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(standing)<br />Oh, please, Doctor Beckett. That's what I like doing most. To share. To share me.</blockquote>
<p>[He helps Beckett rise.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh. And I can see that now.</blockquote>
<p>[They laugh as he leads Beckett away from the other villagers.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You see? All you had to do was get to know me. You know, Carson&#8230;may I call you Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Of course you can!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Carson, this-uh, this city that you keep going on and on about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, Atlantis. Um, on a scale of one to ten, this-this village being a three&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a ten.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
It is? Yeah. And-and those flying ships, you still have those?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You mean the jumpers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, aye, we have several.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Really? How interesting. Tell me more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, Lucius. I think I could do much better than that.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The wormhole activates. Weir comes out of her office.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Incoming wormhole. Opening the shield.<br />
(to Weir)<br />Doctor Beckett's IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's about time.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The guards wait, weapons raised as Beckett steps through the Stargate. Weir runs down the steps to greet him as the guards lower their weapons on spotting Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius arrives. A few guards re-raise their weapons as the wormhole shuts down. Beckett smiles as Lucius laughs in delight.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh my! When you said this place was a ten, I thought okay, <i>maybe</i>, maybe it's an eight and a half, but this&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Carson&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, Doctor Weir, permit me to introduce Lucius Lavin.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius comes closer, eyeing Weir lasciviously.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Speaking of stunning. You never told me anything about her. Oh yeah. Yeah, I am definitely going to like it here.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir turns angrily from Lucius to Beckett.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir, Beckett, and Sheppard watch Lucius down in the isolation room. He is studying himself on the camera monitors in the room below.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(exasperated)<br />I can't believe you brought him here without permission!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I didn't think you'd mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You didn't think I'd mind?! You know the protocols! You even helped come up with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(innocently)<br />There's so much he can offer us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is this the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns around from where he has been studying the computer. He leans against the work station and folds his arms, listening with interest.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard. He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Really? That guy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices&#8230;and gourds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did you just say gourds?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, Rodney, gourds! We don't know everything, despite what you may think. He could prove to be a very powerful ally. He's a very wise and kind man.</blockquote>
<p>[He grins. Sheppard looks skeptical as Weir studies Beckett keenly.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you feeling all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's just you're acting uh, a little&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Smitten?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I had another word in mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir huffs in agreement.]
</p>

(fuming)<br />Are you kidding me? You send a team&#8230;led by Beckett&#8230;to a planet full of Wraith! How do you expect me to react?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir nods pleasantly as everyone else exchanges giddy smiles. Lucius's smile falters, and he watches Sheppard shrewdly.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(shrugging)<br />Well, firstly, they volunteered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And secondly&#8230;we got the herb!</blockquote>
<p>[The trio hold up their bags triumphantly. Everyone laughs and applauds.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett drops his bags.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(hopeful)<br />You will?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Lucius embrace.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yes, I will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />You sent them to get an herb?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We wanted to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay&#8230;I've just about had enough!</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs for Beckett's dropped bag. Teyla snatches it away first and Ronon arms his pistol and aims it at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Whoa! Don't touch it.</blockquote>
<p>[The SFs have their rifles pointed at Sheppard. Weir holds out her hand placatingly and steps in front of Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What on Earth is wrong with you, John? We were just&#8230;helping a friend. And there's nothing wrong with that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(low, to McKay)<br />I think there's something wrong with him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(considering)<br />Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard licks his lips, thinking quickly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know what? I'm just tired. It's this damn cold.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to face Lucius.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I apologize.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(pleased)<br />Hmm. Maybe you should get some rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nodding)<br />You're probably right. I just need a good night's sleep.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir smiles and nods. Sheppard backs away, making no sudden moves as he escapes the circle of guards. He slowly heads to the exit, turning back to see everyone watching him, the wall of SFs turning to protect Lucius.]

</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
So what does this do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That engages the HUD, stands for Heads Up Display.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(chuckling)<br />Heads up. I love that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It gives me whatever information I need when flying the jumper: navigation, weapons&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You fly this thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can fly it too!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, now that you've received the ATA therapy, which I invented. I was actually born with the gene, which makes me much more proficient at operating Ancient technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It does not. He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Don't you lie to Lucius!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You don't even know&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius raises his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
All right, all right! Ba-ba! Boys, stop fighting! A gene, you say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone such as me to operate any technology on Atlantis. I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Doctor McKay, to be able to use some of it as well.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tsks in envy.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(distracted)<br />Really? A gene, eh? You said an inoculation, huh? That's great.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett giggles. McKay steps forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know what's really interesting? If you look at this down here&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay points out a control to Lucius.]

<p>[Beckett stands and looks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can I speak with you for a second?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to nurse)<br />Excuse me.</blockquote>
<p>[The nurse nods, and Beckett heads over to Sheppard, waiting expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispering)<br />I think there might be something wrong with me.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett smiles and pats Sheppard on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(speaking low)<br />It's all right, son. Admitting it is the first step.</blockquote>
<p>[More medical personnel walk by. Sheppard gestures for Beckett to join him in the empty room for more privacy.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
So, you finally came around, did you? You see, once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pulls out a Wraith stunner pistol and shoots Beckett at point-blank range.]

Oh crap.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard catches Beckett as he collapses and begins to drag him away.]

I don't know!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />Jumper Three, please identify. Jumper Three, this is Flight! Identify yourself!<br />
(to Chuck)<br />Look, close the door.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
It's too late. It's left the bay.</blockquote>

</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies across the Lantian ocean, cloaking from sight.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Beckett groans and regains consciousness to find his hands bound in front of him and sitting in one of the starboard chairs. Sheppard flies the jumper.]

Hey, Carson. Sorry about that.</blockquote>

(groggily)<br />What? Where&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm taking you to the mainland. It's for your own good. Trust me.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Weir walks with Lucius.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
How often does that happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This has never happened before. Now, we have very, very strict flight protocols.</blockquote>

I mean, you have to have a key or something like that for&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and a marine meet up with them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
A security officer saw Colonel Sheppard carrying Doctor Beckett toward the jumper bay moments before the jumper took off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
So it was them in the flying machine?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay arrives, looking in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My computer's missing! A tablet, two drives, all of my research!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I told you that man was dangerous! I have to say, Liz, I am very disappointed right now.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir bows her head and places her hands on Lucius's chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I am so very sorry, Lucius.<br />
(to Teyla)<br />Mobilize jumper teams. I want them found.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[The marine and Teyla leave. Weir nervously fusses with Lucius's cravat.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They're very good. They will find them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(distressed)<br />I hope so.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The jumper has landed in the forest. Sheppard types on some controls, and coughs a few times. Beckett sits, shaking his head. He looks pale and sweaty.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(whining)<br />I need to get back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, you don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Lucius needs me. You have no right to abduct me like this.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reaches back and grabs McKay's tablet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Call it an intervention. You probably don't realize it right now, but what you're going through is uh, kind of like a&#8230;a detox.</blockquote>
<p>[He coughs again and brings the tablet over to Beckett, clearing his throat. Beckett looks unwilling to listen, but he pays attention all the same.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now, according to the research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club, that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a&#8230;chemical, it-it interacts with the body and causes a-a secretion of a-of a pheromone, and then there's something about gamma activity in the prefrontral coretrex.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Prefrontal cortex. The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See, that's why I need you! Seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them, uh&#8230;easy to influence. And the longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You mean literally&#8230;an addictive personality?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what it looks like.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett stares at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's rubbish!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Check for yourself! I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb that you collected for him! He made you his mule!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(defensively)<br />If this is true, why weren't you affected?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, my cold! I can hardly breathe. Plus, I haven't been around him much. Look, I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere until the pheromone wore off, but&#8230;the people back on his home planet are starting to get sick, and it looks like they're going to get worse before they get better. I don't want to put our people through that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(whining)<br />You're doing it to me right now!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard punches Beckett in the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Buck up, Carson! You haven't been exposed that long.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs Beckett by the jacket lapels.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing. There's got to be an antidote of some kind!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Beckett stare at each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, you can. You can beat it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(starting to weep)<br />But he needs me!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sobs as Sheppard looks on, shocked.]

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We should head back. We've been searching for hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We just left, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis. Lucius is probably worried. Do you think he's worried?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />Jumper Two, report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />Uh, we're reading several life signs, but they might be Athosian hunting parties. We're going to go check them out.</blockquote>

(into radio)<br />Is Lucius worried about us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />Lucius? He's fine. Just keep looking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon's gun activates and is pointed at Sheppard's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't&#8230;move.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla comes out of the foliage, her weapon also aimed at Sheppard. Sheppard raises his hands and gets up slowly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That thing is set to stun, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nodding)<br />Good.</blockquote>
<p>[He makes a move to grab the pistol, but Ronon fires, catching him point blank in the chest. Sheppard collapses, unconscious. Teyla rushes to Beckett, unsheathing a knife to cut him free. Beckett stares in shock at the downed Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Carson, are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(smiling)<br />I will be&#8230;once I get back to Lucius.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay arrives.]

<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Good morning, Colonel. I want to apologize for this harsh treatment. I hate that Elizabeth had to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Cut the crap.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius leans against the bars and gives a smug smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, that herb of yours&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
One of my greatest discoveries. Well, it's my only great discovery, but you gotta admit&#8230;it's pretty great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How'd you get by before that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I was a baker! Bread mostly&#8230;The occasional muffin at festival time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So that herb pretty much changed everything.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius laughs and grabs a seat.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah. Yeah, I baked it into my own bread. I like to experiment. And I noticed that people started to like me&#8230;well, hate me less, but pretty soon it became like. So I perfected a potion. It worked great for years. Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb. I knew I could never go back there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then we showed up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(smiling)<br />I'm telling you it was fate. And everybody wanted to help, so I let them. See that's the great thing about this herb, nobody gets hurt. They just want to help me all the time. What's wrong with that? I'm a nice guy. I never make them do anything they didn't want to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Six wives?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(smiling lewdly)<br />Sometimes all at once.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks nauseous. Lucius gets up, moving his stool aside.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You know, when you get over this cold, you and I are gonna have a long chat, face-to-face. And I've got a feeling we're gonna be the best of friends. And you're gonna want to help me too, all the time. And you'll love it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just a warning, Lucius, you get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.</blockquote>

That's all right, Colonel. I'm in no rush.</blockquote>

<p>[Lucius keys his radio.]

There. All done. Now, remember, it's only effective in 47% of those who receive it.</blockquote>

Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Okay!</blockquote>
<p>[He moves to hop off the bed, but gets dizzy and has to sit back.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Whoop! It takes about an hour to be effective. In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett leaves McKay and Weir to tend to Lucius, who lies back on the inclined bed.]

Absolutely.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then maybe I'll take you back home. I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, buddy. I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.</blockquote>
