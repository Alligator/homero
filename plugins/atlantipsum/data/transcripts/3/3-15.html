<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team eats their meals together in the crowded mess hall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let me ask you a question. Say there's a runaway train. It's hurtling out of control towards ten people standing in the middle of the tracks. Only way to save those people is to flip a switch, send the train down another set of tracks. The only problem is&#8212;there is a baby in the middle of those tracks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why would anyone leave a baby in harm's way like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I-I don't know. That's not the point. It's an ethical dilemma. Look, Katie Brown brought it up over dinner the other night. Question is: is it appropriate to divert the train and kill the one baby to save the ten people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wouldn't the people just see the train coming and move?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, they wouldn't see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Well, look, I don't know. Say they're blind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
All of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(getting annoyed)<br />
Yes. All of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then why don't you just call out and tell them to move out of the way?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, because they can't hear you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What, they're deaf too? How fast is the train going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(exasperated)<br />
Look, the speed doesn't matter!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, sure it does. If it's going slow enough, you could&#8230;outrun it and shove everyone to the side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Or better yet, go get the baby.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard exchange agreeing nods before Sheppard takes a bite of his orange.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, for god's sake, I was just trying to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wh-yes. Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Major Lorne just dialed in from M4D-058. He says he's got something you'll want to see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands and starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to team)<br />
Work it out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard stand with Weir looking at a monitor which shows Lorne crouched low by a wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over video)<br />
We came through the space gate and immediately noticed a bunch of small satellites in geo-synchronous orbit above the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
An advanced civilization?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over video)<br />
That's what we thought. Then we picked up life signs directly below, so we flew down&#8212;saw several villages separated by a large river and decided to check one of them out. And as you can see&#8230;<br />
(to sergeant off-camera)<br />
Sergeant&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[The sergeant moves the camera to show the village below the wall. The people are using wooden wheelbarrows and simple tools as they go about their daily business.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(continuing, over video)<br />
These people&#8230;don't exactly look like they're ready to be launching any satellites, at least not for the next five hundred years or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ancients probably put them up there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(agreeing)<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to McKay, but heard on radio)<br />
Send a science team to check it out.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne, now back on camera, looks amused.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over video)<br />
Uh, actually&#8230;I think Doctor McKay may want to come check this one out for himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Take a look.</blockquote>
<p>[The off-camera sergeant pans the camera again and zooms its focus onto a small banner hanging from a building. It has a red stripe on each side of the banner, and in the white center is a picture of McKay's face.]
</p><p>[Weir, Sheppard and McKay stare at the image in shock. Sheppard bites his lip as he and McKay exchange looks&#8212;as if they know something about this after all and also know they're in trouble.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir storms into her office, McKay and Sheppard following.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(furious)<br />
How the hell did your face get on that flag?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, uh, I don't know.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir stares from McKay to Sheppard, aware they know more to this than they're saying.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(perplexed)<br />
Wai-wait. Here's the thing though. That flag's very similar to the one I designed in our game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(snappish)<br />
It's exactly like the one you designed in our game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What game?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The game Rodney and I have been playing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(innocently)<br />
Yeah, we didn't tell you about the game?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've been playing for a while now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, off and on in our spare time&#8212;you know, uh, at night, between missions, I could've sworn we told you about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(impatient)<br />
What. Game?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it started a while ago&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>INT&#8212;"GAME" ROOM, ATLANTIS
</p><p>[McKay and a science team enter the room. The control panels light up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Uh, a few months after we arrived here, we were exploring the city, checking out some labs on the East Pier when we discovered a room. There were several Ancient consoles and screens. It was quite an impressive layout. As usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we entered.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay goes to a monitor, which shows a landscape with a winding river.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
At first, we thought it was some kind of a geological facility. There was a screen with a map that we assumed was of the Lantian mainland.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, I remember you briefing me about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, there you go. We did tell you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You mentioned nothing about a game, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's because at first we didn't know what it was&#8230;.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GAME ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay sits at one of the panels. He punches controls and pulls up more menus on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(continuing)<br />
Then, Rodney studied it more closely. He realized it wasn't a geological lab at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
No, it turns out, it was it was in fact a-a-a kind of a&#8230;Ancient game room. The map was of a fictional civilization. It was part of a simulated world.</blockquote>
<p>[The McKay in the flashback grins at his find.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sweet!</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, what you do, is you take these countries that are already in a database and you assume control of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Two societies, separated by a river straight down the middle. Sheppard took one country, I took the other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
First thing Rodney did, besides renaming his country, is put his face all over the flag.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard chuckles and rolls his eyes. McKay also chuckles and grins. Weir looks very unamused.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think you need to check this planet out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard's grins fade. Abashed, they leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper comes through the space gate and flies around M4D-058.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So&#8230;the Ancestors created this game?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, but this is no ordinary game. I mean, it is incredibly challenging, instructional&#8230;I mean the sheer number of options built into it? Staggering.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How does one play it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You gotta figure out the best way to run your country.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, you build roads, you, uh, establish laws, mold it to your own specific ideology.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GAME ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay sit across from each other, each with a computer in front of them. Their monitors show the river landscape. Sheppard looks over at Rodney's side as if trying to guess what he's doing.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
You can control everything. Proper sanitation systems, water delivery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Transportation&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I mean, every detail can be manipulated&#8230;I mean, right down to the women's hairstyles.</blockquote>
<p>[On McKay's computer, he pulls up a computer image of a woman avatar. She wears a white dress with red trim, but there are other options. She has shoulder length red hair and green eyes. McKay changes the hair to blond and short.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello there.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So how do you win this game?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not really about winning.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GAME ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard study information on their respective monitors. They peer over their monitor to look at each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Yeah, it's more about whose society outshines the other's. I mean, who creates a better infrastructure.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing, smugly)<br />
&#8230;who's better at trade.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(innocently)<br />
What? Hey, don't start. I tried to negotiate with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Making a list of demands and not giving anything in return is not negotiating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I offered you an entire crop of beans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't need beans, I need lumber.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, right, to build defensive fortifications for your army, which he doubled in size, by the way. Surprise, surprise.</blockquote>
<p>[They glance back, making their arguments to Ronon and Teyla, who look equally amused and bemused by the conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I only did that after you started cheating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I did not cheat!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's giving his people way too much technology for their level of development. I'm not the only one increasing my army, by the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I had to do something to protect the people of Geldar from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Geldar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's the name of Rodney's country. He named it after a girl he stalked in college.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I did not stalk her. We dated&#8230;twice. Theresa Geldar. Very cute blonde. I always used to think her name reminded me of some kind of a&#8230;mythological land: the kingdom of Geldar.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles, then taps Sheppard on the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What'd you call your country?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Well, I&#8230;just&#8230;kept the name it already had.</blockquote>
<p>[The HUD pulls up an image of a hundred satellites in a square pattern, floating over the planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, there are the satellites.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Dozens of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Positioned directly above the continent. Perfect grid. Ten-by-ten. Should have a visual on one of them&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper approaches a satellite.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Definitely looks Ancient.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. And active. It's transmitting a tremendous amount of data.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's check it out.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper flies down to the surface of M4D-058.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A couple watch a primitive version of a movie on a cylindrical wheel; it shows an animation of a man who has his head pop off and go back on. Other vendors sell telescopes and other science equipment. Sheppard's team walks among the crowd. The villagers who spot McKay stop what they're doing and stare at him. Many of the women in the village have short blond hair.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is amazing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If you say so.</blockquote>
<p>[A man drives by on an early version of a bicycle, with a large front wheel and smaller rear one.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, yeah. That's something you see in every medieval village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, the&#8230;Renaissance obviously came early to these folks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What, a couple hundred years early?</blockquote>
<p>[More and more of the crowd have noticed McKay and have started whispering to each other. The team notices their interest and begins to feel uncomfortable under the scrutiny.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Um&#8230;Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon picks up a tricked-out crossbow on a vendor's table and studies it as the crowd seems to watch with awe&#8212;their attention stuck on McKay. He stares back at them, bewildered, not noticing he's standing under a painting of&#8230;himself in the same pose, complete with jacket with the Canadian flag patch. The painting has a halo over McKay's head. Nola begins to approach. Sheppard looks from the painting to McKay, nonplussed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispering harshly to McKay)<br />
Say something!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low, to Sheppard)<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to McKay)<br />
I don't know!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Hello. I am Nola.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, uh&#8230;this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and I'm&#8230;McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[He flashes Nola, who is an attractive young woman with short blond hair, a charming smile. Nola steps forward and studies McKay's features intently, glancing up to the portrait behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The resemblance is&#8230;uncanny.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay glances back, finally seeing the portrait.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
(awed)<br />
You are the Oracle!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Oracle?</blockquote>
<p>[Nola steps back and bows deeply. All the villagers follow suit.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Welcome to Geldar.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks shocked, and guilty. Sheppard shoots him a narrow look.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PORTAL BUILDING CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Nola leads the team down a stone corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Please forgive my nervousness. I never thought you'd appear to us in the flesh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why do you refer to him as "the Oracle"?</blockquote>
<p>[Nola looks to McKay for permission to speak, he shrugs and waves his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
The Oracle is a wise and omnipotent deity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Boy, she's in for a rude awakening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Thousands of years ago, he gave our ancestors life. He instructed them how to build their society, how to live their lives. His guidance was revered by all. Then one day, without warning, the Oracle ceased all communications.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
War with the Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods in agreement.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Our people were puzzled by this, but they continued to adhere to his instructions, living their lives according to his teachings which they passed down from generation to generation.</blockquote>
<p>[They pass more portraits of McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Have you not had any trouble with the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Yes. They've come periodically&#8212;culled our people, destroyed our villages. Those who survived rebuilt, but only to the level at which the Oracle had instructed before he left. We found ourselves stalled in our development, unwilling to push forward without the Oracle's guidance, hoping one day he would return to us. And two years ago, he did. The Oracle resumed communicating with us, teaching us many new things. He challenged us to think, to push the limit of our scientific endeavors. He changed the name of our country, and even revealed his likeness to us.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grins smugly at yet another portrait. Sheppard shakes his head in disgust.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Enough with the pictures.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PORTAL CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay looks down over a balcony to the floor below, where people work around an Ancient device that shows a map of the continent, similar to that of the game.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, and you communicate through that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
The portal, yes.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GELDAR HEADQUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[The team heads down the stairs to the console.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
It's through this that we receive our instructions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And the Oracle knows when you've carried them out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the satellites! They must be tracking everything that's going on and then relaying it via subspace back to Atlantis. It's remarkable!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So, not a game after all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, it's obviously some kind of, uh, Ancient experiment, uh, social development, to try out different ways to create civilizations.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard points to the symbol of an area on the other side of the river.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This country here&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Hallona.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard preens.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
A persistent thorn in our side.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's face falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Now that you've come to us, you can help us remove it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DUSK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GAME ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka, Lorne, and Weir stand in front of the console.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So this is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(awed)<br />
Yes. Yes, it is an amazing piece of technology. It appears to be a sociological experiment designed by the Ancients to help them as they were seeding various civilizations throughout Pegasus. I-I've had a chance to look at it further, and it-it's interesting, there are many more civilizations in the game's database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Really? I thought Rodney said there were only two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
That's what he thought. The actual countries that he and Colonel Sheppard are controlling are on this specific planet, but I've been able to access the codes to unlock additional levels to the game&#8230;I-I mean, to the ex-experiment. I discovered countries on-on planets throughout the galaxy. Some have been idle for the past ten thousand years, I guess awaiting instructions from the Ancients, but some have managed to develop on their own, even flourish. Some have been destroyed by war, and others have been&#8230;completely wiped out. Er, not that R-Rodney's and Colonel Sheppard's societies are on this path.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare at the civilizations shown on the monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(concerned)<br />
So much power at one's fingertips.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(enchanted)<br />
It's amazing the attraction of this&#8230;game.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir shoots him a worried look.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GELDAR VILLAGE SQUARE</b>
</p><p>[Nola sits at an outdoor table with McKay. Helkin unfurls a blueprint for a dirigible.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
We've managed to achieve propulsion through hand powered propellers, but now we're undertaking tests of steam-powered propulsion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELKIN<br />
Only this morning, I completed a test that proved quite promising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Really, that's great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
(anxious)<br />
You're pleased?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Yes! I mean, this is quite an achievement.</blockquote>
<p>[The rest of McKay's teammates arrive with a man dressed in chain mail, Baden. The villagers watch warily as he approaches. Nola stands when she spots Baden, looking angry.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
What's he doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BADEN<br />
It wasn't my idea.</blockquote>
<p>[A bewildered McKay looks between them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doctor Rodney McKay, meet Baden.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disdainfully)<br />
Oh, your guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, it figures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
I should have you arrested for trespassing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BADEN<br />
Go ahead and try.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Easy now. I brought him here because we need to have a little discussion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
I have nothing to say to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BADEN<br />
Fine with me.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to leave, but Ronon blocks his path, looking menacing.]

Uh&#8230;what are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Preparing our counterattack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What counterattack?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELKIN<br />
From&#8230;information you gave us about high temperature and energetic materials technology, I have constructed a tactical explosive device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait&#8230;a bomb? You actually built a bomb?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
I told you we'd always be several steps ahead of Baden.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How come I didn't know about this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
We have yet to test it, so it still appears to not exist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELKIN<br />
We will target one of Hallona's outlying villages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How are you going to deliver it, huh? I mean, the-the catapult couldn't possibly reach that far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELKIN<br />
I will deliver it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOLA<br />
Using one of the airships you taught us to build.<br />
(to Helkin)<br />
Go.</blockquote>
<p>[Helkin nods and leaves, taking the plans.]

No! I mean&#8230;not specifically. Look&#8230;okay&#8230;maybe I provided them with the list of ingredients&#8230;but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Gah! I don't believe this!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How much damage can it cause?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Enough to take out an entire village?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(panicked)<br />
Well, then you must tell them to stop!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I tried that! It's already on the way!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How are they delivering it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
Dirigible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You just had to cheat, didn't you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I did not cheat! Look, nowhere in the rules did it specifically outlaw the development of flying machines, only the&#8230;degree and speed of technological advancement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, they advanced pretty damn fast, didn't they!?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do we still have time to shoot it down?</blockquote>

Yes. Yes, I think so.</blockquote>

Absurd!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What are you talking about? It's a personally reasonable request.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, yeah. Perfectly reasonable. I give you all of my food, and my people starve.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(talking over Zelenka)<br />
I am not asking you for all your food!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(talking over Lorne)<br />
Yeah, that's perfectly reasonable to me, all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I did say that we would make a deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(scoffing)<br />
A deal. Oh yeah, baskets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Big baskets! Two dozen of them, hand woven, and very nice!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh very nice? What am I going to put in them, huh? Certainly not food!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You know what? I think you're holding out on me. I think you have plenty of food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Are you calling me a liar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
No, I think you're trying to squeeze me for a better deal. That's what I think!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Ach! I have got nothing to hide! Now I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Okay, okay, then maybe I should send some of my army troops down, and we'll have a look, then.</blockquote>

(shouting)<br />
What the hell are you two doing?!</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne straightens to parade rest. Zelenka stares, mouth agape.]

I thought I gave specific orders to stay away from this device?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(abashed)<br />
Yes, yes you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(contrite)<br />
We just saw that there was some&#8230;people in trouble, and we thought maybe that we could&#8230;uh&#8230;help.</blockquote>
<p>[He exchanges looks with Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No! No more help. Clearly, we are not qualified. Now, turn this thing off, disconnect the power, and seal the room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, okay, but we&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(firmly)<br />
Now.</blockquote>

Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>

Yeah, don't worry, no one was hurt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He-he just&#8230;punctured it. It sank harmlessly to the ground.</blockquote>

I had no idea they were capable of delivering such a device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with sidelong glance at Teyla)<br />
Tell me about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BADEN<br />
I've issued orders to make certain they don't try again.</blockquote>

What kind of orders?</blockquote>

So I gotta get Nola to call off the attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(scoffing)<br />
You couldn't do it before. What makes you think you can now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How about a little encouragement, huh? You know, a "go get 'em, Rodney? I have faith in you?"</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, whatever. Look, I am not giving up on these people. Which means until we get them to call this war off, then we are staying put right here!</blockquote>

What? No. That's ridiculous. How could we vanish?</blockquote>

(low, warning)<br />
