<p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team is on the run and under fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We must go faster, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
This is pretty much my top gear!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon pause at cover and return fire while Teyla and McKay get to the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If we make a stand here, we can take 'em!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Negative. We don't know how many we're up against!<br />
(he shoots again and turns to the others)<br />
Rodney, dial the damn gate! Don't wait for us!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is already dialing while Teyla provides cover fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(frantic)<br />
As if the bullets whizzing past my head weren't encouragement enough!</blockquote>
<p>[The firefight continues.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pushing glyphs)<br />
Okay, six, seven.</blockquote>
<p>[The wormhole activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is McKay to Atlantis! We're coming in hot!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Teyla run through the Stargate. Ronon and Sheppard follow. Someone fires a twin harpoon at Sheppard, piercing his vest and pulling him backward to the ground at the last second. Ronon makes it through and the wormhole shuts down.]
</p><p>[Sheppard finds himself surrounded by several armed Genii. The harpoon shooter is Kolya, who lowers his weapon and approaches. He smiles and crouches closer to the ground to be more on Sheppard's level.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
It's good to see you again, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Kolya.</blockquote>
<p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Several heavily armed teams walk through the Stargate from an incoming wormhole. Weir stands waiting for them. Teyla, McKay, and Ronon are the last to arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There was no sign of Colonel Sheppard or our attackers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And they covered their tracks well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's a good chance he was transported off-world, so I've gathered the last fifty or so gate addresses that were dialed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That should be helpful, but since the transmission which summoned us to the planet was sent using a code we gave to the Genii, that will be our starting point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
What are you gonna do, like <i>ask</i> the Genii if one of them took Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(calmly)<br />
Yes, I am.</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate chevrons light up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So&#8230;this&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, it is.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and McKay move out of the path of the kawhoosh as the Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Incoming wormhole! We're receiving the new identification code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Security teams stand by.</blockquote>
<p>[Ladon and three Genii soldiers enter from the wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Welcome, Ladon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I came as soon as I&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon approaches Ladon and towers over him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(furious)<br />
What've you done with Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(firmly)<br />
Ronon, he is here as our guest.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon has a snarl on his face, but steps back.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
How can I help?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII CELLS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is in a cell. It has three stone walls and the front is encased with metal bars. Another cell is next to his.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Kolya? I didn't kill you last time, remember?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard kicks the doors.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Gah!<br />
(sotto voce)<br />
You promised me points for that.<br />
(yelling)<br />
Kolya!<br />
(to himself)<br />
Dammit. Should've killed him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
(from the next cell)<br />
You're wasting your breath.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Didn't know I had company down here.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps to the wall between the cells. There is a small barred window between the cells.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
There is no escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Prisons are like that. Never stopped me before. How long have you been down here?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard peers through the bars, trying to get a look at his neighbor. All he can see is a shadowed figure shifting his legs.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
Many years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How many is "many"? Five? Ten?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
It no longer matters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, that many, huh? What did you do to get here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
I merely allowed myself to be captured alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Same here. Look, I got people looking for me, and when they find me, maybe we can both uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[An outer door to the area opens, and three armed Genii soldiers arrive and unlock Sheppard's cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where we movin' to?</blockquote>
<p>[The guard cocks a large alien shotgun type weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I kinda like it here.</blockquote>
<p>[The guard fires a blast past Sheppard's soldier, blowing a large hole through the wall behind him. Sheppard flinches from the blast and gets struck by debris.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Commander Kolya insists.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, he insists? Well, why didn't you just say so?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps out of the cell. After he passes the guard with the shotgun, he spins back and delivers a roundhouse punch, trying to pull the shotgun out of the guard's grasp. Another guard strikes him with a small whip that emits some kind of electric charge. Sheppard shouts in pain and collapses unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Pick him up.</blockquote>
<p>[The other guards drag Sheppard away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Atlantis SFs disarm the Genii guards. They lead away all but Lodan and his aide.]Ladon
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sorry this is necessary, but under the circumstances, I'm sure you understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I came here as a friend, Doctor Weir; I hope to leave as one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And we appreciate your concern for Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Despite the fact that it was your incompetence that led to his capture.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry, but there is no disputing the fact that it was a code we provided the Genii that was used to lure us to that planet where we were ambushed!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Doctor McKay is quite correct. You entrusted us with codes, and I allowed them to be stolen from us. How and by whom is an ongoing investigation, but I must assume it was someone close to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Or this is part of your plans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(with humorless smile)<br />
It would not be the first time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I say this rhetorically, since I should think it is obvious. But if I were involved in this in any way, or if my intentions were anything less than honorable, would I have come to Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
With you, who knows? All I know is my friend has been kidnapped, and you had something to do with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Which is why I have walked away from significant responsibilities as leader of my people to come here and offer our help. Now, you can either let me do that, or you can continue to berate me for my mistake. The choice is yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh, we have more choices than that!</blockquote>
<p>[He looms over Ladon again.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I see no reason to stay here if this is how I am to be treated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Trust me, you're not goin' anywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ronon, I understand how you feel. Believe me, I do. But we're gonna deal with this my way.<br />
(to Ladon)<br />
Let's continue this in my office&#8230;privately.</blockquote>
<p>[She and Ladon head up the stairs, leaving the others standing there.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CAMERA ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is tied to chair in the room. The three guards are there, as well as Kolya. A device similar to a 1950s era television studio camera is wheeled nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
It's been some time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You must have really missed me to go through all this trouble. Nice harpoon, by the way.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya smirks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
To capture an extraordinary soldier takes extraordinary measures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll take that as a compliment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
As you should. Just as you should understand this is not personal. As soon as my goal is achieved, you'll be returned to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That simple, huh? What do you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
It's not a question of what I want. It's a question of who.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Now, I entrusted the IDC codes you provided to two men in my government&#8212;my second minister in the event of my death, and my personal assistant, Cassel Massan. I trust both of these men implicitly&#8230;or rather I did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are both men now accounted for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Yes. In fact, they're in custody. They're being questioned as we speak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(skeptically)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Don't underestimate the importance of this alliance between our two peoples to the Genii, Doctor Weir. In fact, when I heard the news, my first concern was&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Klaxons blare.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(over comm)<br />
We have an unscheduled off-world activation.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Ladon leave the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Identification code?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is at a console beside Chuck.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
None, but we're receiving an analog video signal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Bring it up.</blockquote>
<p>[A fuzzy image of Kolya appears on screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Doctor Weir, if you're receiving this, please respond.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone stares at the image in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who the hell is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Aucustus Kolya. A Genii military leader who once tried to seize Atlantis. Ladon was a member of his strike team.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon turns and glares at Ladon, processing this information.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
I do know you're there, Doctor. The existence of Atlantis is no secret among the Genii. It would be&#8230;pointless not to answer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Chuck)<br />
Open a channel.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck signals the line is active.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This is Doctor Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Oh good. I wanted to be certain you were there to see this.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya steps to the side to reveal a bound and gagged Sheppard sitting behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What have you done to him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Nothing whatsoever, Doctor McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, let me rephrase that. What are you planning to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Oh, it's quite simple. I'd like to make a trade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Before we continue this conversation another second, I want to speak with Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Be my guest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We'll rephrase that, too. We would like him to be able to speak to us.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<p>[He nods and a guard removes Sheppard's gag.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shouting desperately through video)<br />
On my command authority, whatever he asks, don't do it! Even if&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The guard quickly replaces the gag, and Kolya laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Well, as you can see, he's his usual charming self.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Explain your terms, Kolya.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
I have heard the familiar voices of yourself and Doctor McKay. But there is one person I know is there who has yet to speak. Ladon Redim is with you, is he not?</blockquote>
<p>[Ladon and Weir exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(cautiously)<br />
Why would Ladon be here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Well, to preserve his precious alliance with you, Doctor, so that the Genii might remain in the favor of Atlantis. My sources have already confirmed this, so there's no point in denying the fact. Turn him over to me, and Colonel Sheppard will be released immediately.</blockquote>
<p>[Ladon looks nervous. Weir exchanges looks with McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(coldly)<br />
I'll need time to consider your offer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
Allow me to help expedite your decision.</blockquote>
<p>[The camera pans to the door of the room. Guards lead in a fettered and weakened Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh my god.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CAMERA ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard gives increasingly panicked breaths through his gag as the Wraith is led near him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(desperately, through radio)<br />
Sheppard could have left you to rot down in that hole when we last met, Kolya. He does not deserve this!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Let's be clear, Doctor McKay. No one does.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith is unchained from his manacles and physically held back from Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Don't do this. Don't do it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
The choice is yours, Doctor Weir. Do we have an arrangement?</blockquote>
<p>[No one speaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya nods to his men. The Wraith stares at Sheppard, then slams his feeding hand onto Sheppard's chest. Sheppard is in agony.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Stop! Stop!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Enough.</blockquote>
<p>[The guard use the electric whip to break the Wraith away from Sheppard and pull him back. Sheppard is weakened and in shock. His sideburns are streaked with grey and there are lines around his eyes. Kolya appears moved by Sheppard's state, but schools his face to be impassive as Sheppard glares at him.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(determined)<br />
You've just crossed a line, Kolya.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(over video)<br />
We've found that a minimum of three hours between feeding sessions is crucial to ensure the body has sufficient time to recover from the trauma. That's the time you have to decide. Three hours.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya's face has filled the screen, and the image shuts off. Everyone exchanges troubled looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII CELLS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard lies half propped against a wall of his cell. His neighbor can be heard in the next cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
They called you Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(weakly)<br />
Yeah. That's my name. Pleased to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
You are in pain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I just got fed on by a Wraith. What do you think?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
I would not know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hopefully, you'll never have to find out.</blockquote>
<p>[He shifts to sit up and groans in pain at the effort.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't think anything could hurt that much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
You're still alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, well&#8230;I don't know how many years the darn thing took off my life. But I'll tell you this: if Kolya's men hadn't'a pulled that damn thing off, I'd be dust in a flak jacket.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
Do you blame the Wraith, or the master?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm gonna go with both.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
There is a difference. The Wraith must feed in order to live. For a Wraith, hunger burns like a fire. Tell me, Sheppard, if you found yourself burning alive, would you settle for just one drop of water, or would you take more?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard furrows his eyebrows. While the prisoner speaks, he struggles to his feet to try and look at his neighbor through the window.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(suspiciously)<br />
When'd you hear them call me "Sheppard"?</blockquote>
<p>[The prisoner steps forward into the light. His fellow prisoner is the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH PRISONER<br />
Just before I started to feed.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gulps in shock.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ladon, Weir, and the remainder of Sheppard's team are in the room. All but Ronon are sitting. Ronon leans against the wall directly behind Ladon's chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Of course, you would see him only as the monster who tried to take your city from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Kolya also killed several of our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He would have killed Doctor Weir as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I won't make excuses for his actions or mine during the failed Atlantis mission. We were soldiers under Cowan's orders. But that failure shattered Kolya's stature among the Genii. It forced him from Cowan's inner circle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You managed to stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Cowan had no choice but to keep me. I was his chief scientist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And you just left Kolya out in the cold.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
That was his choice, not mine. I will admit, in what little contact we had before Kolya went underground, he spoke of overthrowing Cowan's corrupt regime, and I was admittedly torn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(skeptically)<br />
Out of loyalty to Cowan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Out of the belief that neither man had what it took to lead the Genii into the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, instead you&#8212;having what it took&#8212;overthrew Cowan yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Kolya believes that I have taken his rightful place as leader of our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No wonder he's pissed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, obviously he has men loyal to him in your inner circle. Hence the codes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Well, those traitors will be found.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sounds like you're the traitor to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Must he be here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The more I hear, the more I'm glad he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
(uncomfortably)<br />
I could have told you anything. I chose to tell you the truth. If you trade my life for Sheppard's, you will not only be yielding to blackmail, but you will be planting the seeds of civil war.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So what? I say we turn him over and let 'em fight it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because&#8230;<br />
(rethinking)<br />
Well&#8230;can we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard has already ordered us not to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(nodding)<br />
At this point, it's not his decision. There's still time for us to find him and launch a rescue operation. Has there been any progress?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We have a list of planets where recent Genii activity's been documented, but we'd have a much higher margin of success if <i>Ladon</i> would be willing to point out firm locations of Genii safe houses and shelters, maybe even hidden Wraith-infested torture chambers.</blockquote>
<p>[They all turn to Ladon. Ronon moves closer. Ladon nods nervously.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII CELLS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard paces in his cell, breathing heavily.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Your anger will only weaken you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
You realize he is torturing both of us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh yeah? What'd he do to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
He stopped me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really? And how is that torture?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Have you ever known starvation, Sheppard? The few years I took from you are barely enough to keep me alive. The strength I gained from you is already fading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't really give a damn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
You pace in your cell, cursing that I took years from you&#8230;I stand here cursing that I was not allowed them all! Each, in our own way, we suffer!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard approaches the window and glares at the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This might come as a surprise to you, but I'm not really in the mood for conversation. So why don't you just do me a favor, and shut the hell up!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith reaches out with his feeding hand, but there is enough space between the windows of their shared cells that he can't quite reach. Sheppard flinches slightly in startled fear.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />

He is strong, knocking guards away and taking fire at point blank range. He knocks down the remaining two shooters, then feeds on one while holding down the other.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;GATE AREA, PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activates. Several Genii soldiers watch as a puddle jumper comes through and instantly cloaks as they fire on it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay flies the jumper, Teyla in the copilot seat. Beckett, Ronon, and marines are also in the jumper. The HUD display is in front of them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The facility is straight ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[Dots appear on the screen. Some disappearing as they talk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're detecting life signs on the surface, miles from the bunker.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How many?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When it first came up, it was eight, then four&#8230;I don't get it. Now, it's just the two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's going on down there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, one of them's definitely Sheppard. His subcutaneous transmitter's still broadcasting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Could the other one be Kolya?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Let's hope so.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Land a hundred meters to the south of their position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[He does so, confused.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The soldiers are all dead. The Wraith stands over Sheppard. He is barely alive. The Wraith bends down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(defiant)<br />
Finish it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
As I told you, John Sheppard, there are many things about Wraith that you do not know.</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches out with his feeding hand.]
</p><p>[In another area of the forest, Sheppard's team and the marines approach. Ronon leads, signaling to hold. They hear Sheppard cry out in agony. Everyone races forward. Ronon pulls the Wraith off of Sheppard and raises his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith stands. Sheppard gets up. He looks fine, as he did before the first feeding. Everyone surrounds the Wraith, weapons raised.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Leave him. That's an order!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon grudgingly complies and lowers his weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't understand. We all saw what he did to you.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare at Sheppard in shock. Sheppard also looks confused as he approaches the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He just undid it. Lower your weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[The marines comply.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How is this possible?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't ask me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
The gift of life is reserved only for our most devout worshipers&#8230;and our brothers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I guess there's a lot about the Wraith we don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Sheppard gave me back my life. I merely repaid the debt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What debt?! Are you kidding? I mean, he looks younger than he did before!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What about Kolya?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, god.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard feels his pockets for the radio. He finds it on the ground where he'd been lying.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Kolya?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kolya stands beside an active wormhole. He picks up his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
This is Sheppard. Kolya? I figured you'd run! Next time, I kill you on sight, do you hear me?!</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya looks dismayed, and doesn't respond. He walks through the event horizon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard paces angrily.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get off this rock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(nodding to Wraith)<br />
What about him?</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith watches nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We had a deal, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
I did not truly expect you to honor it.</blockquote>
<p>[He chuckles. Ronon hands Sheppard his stunner. Sheppard looks at the gun, grabs it and shoots the Wraith. Ronon snatches the gun back and checks the setting.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(disappointed)<br />
You didn't kill him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, I didn't.<br />
(to marines)<br />
Get him in the jumper. We're gonna drop him off somewhere.</blockquote>
<p>[The marines start dragging the unconscious Wraith. Sheppard follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay as he passes)<br />
Thanks for showing up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST CLEARING BY STARGATE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith awakens with a start. He sees Sheppard, geared up and holding a P-90 aimed toward him. The Stargate is active in the distance. The Wraith feels his chest for injury.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Ah, Sheppard. I thought you&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's a lot you don't know about humans.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith looks around, realizing he is on a different planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
(nodding)<br />
Ah, I see. Next time we meet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All bets are off.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare at each other. A Wraith dart is heard flying overhead. While the Wraith looks at it, Sheppard backs into the cargo hold of the cloaked jumper, disappearing when the Wraith looks around. He feels a breeze.]
