<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Doctor Hewston walk down a corridor. Both are dressed in workout clothes. The corridor is crowded with people out of uniform walking around.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I could never just say that to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Why not? You like him, don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That is not the point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
I think that's exactly the point, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The ways of my people are&#8230;different. I would never&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Uh, he's not going to make the first move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh, we shall see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Look, you know him better than I do&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(primly)<br />
I would hope so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
But&#8230;I wouldn't be surprised if he was oblivious to the whole situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It bears no further discussion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
All right&#8230; I'm just saying, if you want me to have somebody drop some hints, I could&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Can you remember the last time so many people had the day off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Yeah, it's all Heightmeyer's doing. She insisted that the brass order some sort of "mandatory rest day". I guess downtime here doesn't really happen organically. Hey, and don't think I haven't realized you've changed the subject.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My people have a day of rest every four nights.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
(intrigued)<br />
Ooh, now, that is civilized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Hey, want to grab a late lunch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I would like that.<br />
(stopping short)<br />
I forgot my bantos rods at the gym.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can I meet you there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEWSTON<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways. Teyla starts walking back. As she turns the corner, a fireball explosion rips through the corridor from behind, knocking Teyla to the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<p>[The hallway is filled with smoke and flames. People scream in pain and fear as a klaxon blares overhead. One man runs down the hall; he is aflame. Teyla moans, gasping for air. A piece of shrapnel is imbedded in her abdomen. She falls unconscious.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>THREE HOURS EARLIER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Branton walks into Weir's office. Weir works at her computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(distracted)<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
What are you, uh, what are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(smiling)<br />
I work here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
But it's our day off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, shouldn't you be enjoying your leisure time, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
I got a little behind on my research this week. Just wanted to drop off some results for the next Earth transmission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Right. Good.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes back to typing.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
I was thinking about grabbing some food. Care to join?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
I can't, I've&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
You're not capable of having lunch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(laughing, self-conscious)<br />
Yes, I'm capable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Are you planning on eating today?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Great. Eat with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look, it's nothing personal, but I make it a point to not have relationships with people who work for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
I don't work for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm your boss. Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Well, you're my boss's&#8230;boss, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Still, however indirectly&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Yeah, but with that thinking, everyone on this entire planet works for you. Youâ€™re not going to be friends with any of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Friends is one thing&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Nervously, she goes back to typing.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Oh, you think&#8230;oh, wait a second. I-I see what's happening here. You think I'm asking you out on a date. No, no, no, no, th-this isn't a date. This is-this is lunch.<br />
(sitting)<br />
This is the&#8212;the mandatory refueling of our bodies. This is you know, putting food in your mouth and chewing it, and having something more engaging than a wall sitting across from you. That's all it is. I mean, come on. You've got to admit&#8212;I am much more appealing than a wall, no?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir smiles with an arced eyebrow.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
No, you don't have to&#8230;admit it, but it would be a massive blow to my ego if you thought otherwise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You are more appealing&#8230;than a wall.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Great. Now, what say we go grab some grub?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh, I still have an hour of work to do, and&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
(cutting her off)<br />
An hour, then. I'll see you in the mess hall.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. Weir sighs in obvious uncertainty.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[The doorbell chimes. Teyla goes to answer it and finds Weir standing in her doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Elizabeth, you're early! Just give me a moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Um, how set on lunch were you today?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(rolling her eyes)<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, something's come up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing, frustrated)<br />
Elizabeth, surely whatever work it is you feel you must get done can wait.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I was invited to lunch by Mike Branton.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(with sly grin)<br />
Oh, really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You and I, we had plans, and&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(interrupting)<br />
My friend, Dr. Hewston, just radioed me. She wants me to teach her some bantos fighting this afternoon, so&#8230;do not worry. I will have something to occupy my time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay&#8230;Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(firmly)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. Hmph.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir opens the door and looks back at Teyla with a nervous smile. Teyla giggles.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir encounters Beckett near the gate room and they walk towards the steps together. Weir has changed out of her uniform into a green low cut top and pants. Beckett wears a fishing vest over his long-sleeved t-shirt.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hello. Oh! Don't you look lovely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you, Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's the first time I've seen you out of your base uniform in quite some time now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, I don't-donâ€™t know about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Off somewhere special?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, just getting some lunch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ah&#8230; Rodney and I are going fishing on the mainland this afternoon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know, I cleared the use for the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Care to join us? Who knows what kind of wonderful fish we'll find?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's very kind, but some other time, maybe.</blockquote>
<p>[He stops her with a hand on her arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(teasing)<br />
Oh! What, do you have a hot date?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(flustered)<br />
What? Who told you that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(grinning)<br />
No one. I was joking. I was right. Who is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir glares at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
None of my business. Have a lovely afternoon, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts jogging up the stairwell, leaving Beckett down below.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(teasing)<br />
You smell good, too!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(sing-song)<br />
Shut up!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett chuckles.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Branton sit across from each other at a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Do you believe that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Truly and in your heart, you believe that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
I just don't know that I can ever respect you again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
You think <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> is better than <i>Annie Hall</i>? You're a crazy person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Okay&#8230; <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> is essentially a remake, a cheap imitation, a bad cover-song version of <i>Annie Hall</i>. You realize that, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(shrugging, mouth full)<br />
I disagree.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
I know you do, but that's what makes you crazy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I guess this will never work out, then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
This?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(nervous)<br />
Lunch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Ah. Now does that mean that&#8212;that you don't believe that men and women can be friends?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I never said that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Mm, you didn't have to say it. Any lady that likes <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> that much thinks men and women can't be friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Fine. Maybe I do.</blockquote>
<p>[She smiles flirtatiously before taking a drink of water.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
So where does that leave me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I guess that leaves you at lunch.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands and beckons with his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
If lunch is all I get, I'm going to get as much bang for my buck as possible.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS ALCOVE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Branton sit on a bench overlooking the water. Their water bottles are with them.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It really is beautiful here, isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Yeah. All done?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir takes a last swig of her water bottle.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
(sighing)<br />
I guess lunch is over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I guess it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
I should have brought dessert. It would've lasted longer.</blockquote>
<p>[He stares at her. She holds his gaze for a moment, then looks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I should really get back anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Well, what are you doing tomorrow?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Mike&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
No, I like you, and I'm extremely charming. Heh. I'd like to see you spin those into negatives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I just don't think&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
(interrupting)<br />
It's probably best you don't think.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Would you stop interrupting me? You have a tendency to do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
(laughing)<br />
I do not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, you do. I hate it when people interrupt me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Well, if I hadn't interrupted you, we would never have had lunch. Life needs a little interrupting every now and again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, I don't completely disagree.</blockquote>
<p>[Branton kisses Weir. She returns the kiss, then leans back.]
</p>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
(nervous)<br />
Was that&#8230;way out of line?</blockquote>
<p>[She stares at him and stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I can't do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Just because we work together?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This would split my focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BRANTON<br />
Give it a chance, see if it&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(cutting him off)<br />
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have done this in the first place. I thought maybe I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Dr. Weir, please report to the control room immediately.</blockquote>
<p>[She shrugs and leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir enters. Everyone is moving frantically around, trying to restore order.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
There's been an explosion at the base of the tower, near the gym. Early reports have at least three dead, and there's about a dozen or so that are severely injured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
An explosion? Was there some sort of equipment malfunction?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
No, we're still going over the data logs, but we're pretty sure it wasn't a malfunction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So it could have been a bomb?</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck nods.]
</p><p><b>FIVE HOURS EARLIER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla walks down a corridor. Sheppard and Ronon spot her. Sheppard wears a black polo shirt and khaki slacks, and carries a golf club.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, hey, there you are. Been looking all over for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Oh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What, did you forget?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(affronted)<br />
You forgot!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You were going to teach Ronon and myself how to play golf.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(smiling)<br />
That's the plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm afraid I have made other plans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What other plans?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Having lunch with Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you've still got time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(thinking quickly)<br />
Yes, true. However, I am afraid I have been&#8230;quite delinquent in filing my mission reports. I had hoped to get caught up before I met with Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon exchange skeptical looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If you would like, I could cancel&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. No, no, no. She could use a little time out of the office. Some other time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Some other time.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla slaps Ronon on the arm as she passes. Ronon watches her leave enviously.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You know, uh, John, I got mission reports, too&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nice try. It's going to be fun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(dubious)<br />
Fun? Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<p>[He follows Sheppard slowly out of the area.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A golf ball lands in the water near the base.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS DRIVING RANGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard has set up a driving range off one of the piers of Atlantis. He and Watson each are using the tees. Ronon stands at the back of the room, leaning on Sheppard's golf bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>WATSON<br />
Nice shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you&#8230;Jim. It was pretty nice, though, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Watson drives a ball.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(bored)<br />
So that's the sport? You just hit a little ball as far as you can?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
First, it's a game, and, no, it's a little more complicated than that. See, there are eighteen holes, all made up of varying lengths and dimensions. First goal is to hit the ball through a series of water and sand hazards until you land on the green, then you putt the ball into the hole.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon flexes a club and steps up to where Watson was standing. Sheppard has driven another ball while he's been talking.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(indicating the ocean)<br />
So, this is a water hazard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, uh, we don't have a course yet. All we have for now is driving range, where you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Just hit a little ball?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
Pretty much, yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's so hard about that?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard hits another ball into the water.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well&#8230; I make it look easy, but I've been playing since I was six.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(unimpressed)<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, although it seems simple, developing a sweet swing like mine takes years&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon swings his club one-handed. The ball flies out an immense distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>WATSON<br />
Whoa.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(grinning)<br />
Like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(dismissive)<br />
That was okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WATSON<br />
Okay?! You can't even see where it landed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well&#8230;it's not a distance game, it's an accuracy one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, pick a spot, I'll hit it there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
First off, your grip. It's all wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ah, yes, of course. There you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WATSON<br />
Hey, Doc, I wanted to come see you. I've been having this weird pain&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to indicate a spot on his abdomen, but Beckett shakes his head and puts up his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Hold on, sorry. Let me stop you right there. It's the first day I've had off in over a month. Doctor Cole is in the infirmary and would be more than glad to help you out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WATSON<br />
Okay. Fair enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Watson leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's up, Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Fishing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(enthusiastic)<br />
Rodney and I are heading to the mainland to catch a fish that seems to be just like a trout. Care to join us? Sport of kings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought horse racing was the "sport of kings."</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(scornfully)<br />
For the boring kings, maybe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Carson, you're Scottish. This is your game. Wouldn't you rather be on the driving range?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ach, it was never my thing. Come on, last chance.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon exchange unenthusiastic looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think we're going to pass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right. But don't be jealous when I return with a record-breaking space trout. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[He spreads his arms wide to indicate a large fish while grinning excitedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll try to contain ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, aye. Ha.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett leaves. Ronon off-handedly strikes another ball one handed into the distance, and drops the club.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Time for a real sport. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. Sheppard tries to copy Ronon's movement. His drive barely gets the ball off the tee, letting it plop unceremoniously in the water close to the dock. Annoyed, he follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS WORKOUT ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard has changed into a t-shirt and workout pants. Ronon hands him a stick and blue cloth. He has his own blue cloth and places his own blue cloth to hang out the waistband of the back of his pants.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Grab the other guy's flag, huh? That's it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard tucks his flag into the back of his pants.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No penalties and stuff?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if the other guy pulls your hair or tries to bite you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Bite back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ready as I'll ever be.</blockquote>
<p>[They duel with the sticks, Ronon easily spinning Sheppard and nicking his flag as they pass.]
</p>

Now, Doctor Beckett examined them that night and gave them a clean bill of health, so with no immediate "apparent" danger, we, um, decided to figure out what the device was, uh, well, whenever we had time. That was a mistake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the science of it is, uh, well, itâ€™s spectacularly complicated, but, um, it appears to be a weapon&#8212;one created by the Ancients to battle the Wraith, and one that was abandoned fairly early on as it affected everyone in proximity, including Ancients and humans.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>DOCTOR BIRO<br />
Oh, hey there, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hello. I was just&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR BIRO<br />
(over enthusiastic)<br />
You know what's crazy? I was just thinking about you. Does that ever happen to you? You know, you're thinking about something, and then boom&#8230;there it is? It's not that I'm psychic or anything, but, who knows?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
Well, actually&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR BIRO<br />
(interrupting)<br />
You know what? I am sorry. You were going to say something, and I interrupted you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(firmly)<br />
Enjoy your day off, Doctor Biro.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR BIRO<br />
Absolutely.</blockquote>

Bye-bye.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns and leaves, looking relieved to escape.]

</p><p>[Beckett enters. Cole sits at a station.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Slow day?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
(surprised)<br />
Carson. What the hell are you doing here? It's supposed to be your day off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, my fishing trip is officially a bust, so I figured I'd come in here and actually catch up on some paperwork for the first time in over a year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
Well, that's a shame.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, it is.</blockquote>
<p>[Cole turns back, wincing and groaning as she leans over her computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
No, a migraine. It's a bad one, actually. I-I took some stuff, but, you know, I can't take any more, being the on-call, and everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You should have radioed me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
You kidding? There was no way in hell I was going to let you miss that fishing trip. It's all you've been talking about for two weeks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, I'm not going now, so off you go. I'll cover your shift.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
You sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, there's nothing happening here anyway. You go take a horse pill and rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
(sighing in relief)<br />
Oh, you're a lifesaver.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COLE<br />
Thanks, Carson. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[She hugs Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're welcome.</blockquote>
<p><b>LATER</b>
</p><p>[Beckett wraps an ACE bandage around the ankle of an attractive female marine.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
If you're going to play volleyball, you're going to need proper gym shoes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARINE<br />
I know. I've put an order in for a pair, but it takes forever to get things from Earth that aren't vital to the success of the missions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, you, young lady, are vital to the success of the missions, so don't play sports in sandals, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARINE<br />
Okay, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, we're all done here. We'll fix you up some crutches and, uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The room shakes from the explosion, and klaxons blare. Beckett instantly springs into action, turning to a nearby medic.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Meyers, call in every available nurse and doctor immediately. You and you, grab two field kits and a couple of stretchers and follow me.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs a field medical kit and starts to leave.]

What happened here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Some sort of explosion. At least three dead maybe a dozen or so severely injured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEYERS<br />
Doc!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett walks with Teyla's stretcher as they lead her to the infirmary. She regains consciousness sluggishly.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Teyla&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Carson&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She reaches for his hand, and he grabs it.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm here. You've been in an explosion, Teyla, and a piece of debris has impacted your side. We're heading to the infirmary to take it out and patch you up. Easy-peasy. I can do this one in my sleep.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Beckett finishes Teyla's surgery.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, all set? Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
I can't believe you got the artery cleaned up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(self-deprecatingly)<br />
Well, they typically don't make you head surgeon if you're all thumbs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
You have another patient waiting for you. He got his leg cut up pretty bad in the blast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, we're all done here. Let's get her down to recovery level and get him in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Okay.</blockquote>

Explosive tumors? Are you kidding me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I wish I was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, wait, this guy Watson&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Has almost definitely been exposed, yes. Look, we need to find him before that tumor ignites, which could be any minute now.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Beckett examines Watson's leg injury.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, it's not good but it's not awful. We need to start right away. What's his name?</blockquote>
<p>[Marie checks her chart.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Uh, James&#8230; James Watson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(surprised)<br />
Watson? Poor lad was in here last night. Looks like he's had a run of bad luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Dr. Watson, Dr. James Watson, report your whereabouts immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, aren't you popular?<br />
(To Marie)<br />
Go see what that's about, please.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
He's in the O.R. right now? I need you to get Beckett back on his radio.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
It's Dr. McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[She activates the headset as Beckett starts his surgery.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio, impatient)<br />
What is it, Rodney? I'm a little busy right now.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The ensuing conversation switches between McKay's lab and the infirmary.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio, panicked)<br />
Carson! The man you are working on right now has been infected with an explosive tumor. We think it's what killed Hewston and caused the explosion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What are you talking about? That's not&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is possible, Carson. Look, you need to get you and your team out of there. Sheppard has an ordnance disposal crew on the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, he's too fragile to move right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
<i>He</i> doesn't have to move. You do.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett takes a deep breath, processing this.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to surgical staff)<br />
All right, listen up. I need everyone to clear the floor right now. I'm enacting a Protocol Seven for this entire level. Move it, people!<br />
(to Marie, pointing to Watson)<br />
Right, he stays, you go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Wh-what about you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm staying put.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Well, then, so am I.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look, I don't have time to fight about this right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Then don't. You can't do this on your own.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett goes to a computer and enacts a Protocol Seven Lockdown. Klaxons begin to blare. He turns to Marie and clasps her by the shoulders.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you. All right, let's get the scanner in place. We have a tumor to remove.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard studies a schematic of Atlantis that shows a red light on one level of the main tower.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's used his authorization code to seal off the whole level. We can't get to him.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The ensuing conversation switches between McKay's lab and the infirmary.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Carson, you cannot seriously be considering operating on this guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Exactly how much time do we think I have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There is no way to know for sure. Look, Hewston was infected at the same time that Watson was, and her tumor's already exploded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(sighing)<br />
No time to waste, then. Making first incision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, look, this is all very brave and all, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
What if the explosion causes structural damage? What if the tower comes down with everyone in it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Sending him to the other side of the city and just leaving him there is tantamount to murder, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The man is already dead!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Like hell he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Carson, I can't order you to stand down, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(interrupting)<br />
That's right, you can't. Have your men standing by. I'll open access to the floor once I've extracted the tumor. Beckett out.</blockquote>

About ten minutes. I got emergency crews standing by. Either way, we're covered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can't you bypass his access code?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but that'll take half an hour. Look, if he's not done removing it by then, then&#8212;</blockquote>

<p>[The bomb expert arrives. He signals Beckett to stay put as he stops wheeling the containment chamber. He takes the cooler from Beckett's hands and nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett turns and walks swiftly back to the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />

We've said goodbye to a lot of friends today. Our mission is a dangerous one. We lose people, a fact we're all painfully aware of. But Carson was&#8230;I can't remember anyone coming to me with a complaint against him. Ever. He was a kind soul. He was-he was a healer&#8230;and he will be very deeply missed. George Fabricius said: "Death comes to us all, but great achievements, they build a monument which shall endure until the sun grows cold." Every single life Carson saved is a monument to him&#8230;and that gives me great comfort.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir composes herself and nods to the balcony. A musician begins to play the bagpipes, and Chuck dials the Stargate. Once the wormhole is active, Cole, Lorne, Zelenka, Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay act as pallbearers and bring the coffin home. Weir stands by Teyla as they watch them leave.]
