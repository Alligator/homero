</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS WORK OUT ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon stares down his opponent.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Eyes straight ahead. Focus on me. Never, ever look away from your enemy. Shows weakness. Are you weak?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
Uh&#8230; No?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon faces McKay. Both are holding blunt sticks shaped like swords. McKay is dressed in a gii too big for him. A protective covering and yellow belt are strapped around his waist.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Good. Are you ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon raises his hand to strike. McKay raises his own arms anticipating to counter. Ronon takes advantage of his unprotected abdomen and strikes, causing McKay to groan and double over.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
McKay, what did I say? Don't take your eyes off me! Got to anticipate the next move. You all right?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay wheezes and groans, unable to speak from the blow. He nods and gives the thumbs-up sign. Ronon claps him on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right. Well, I'm trying to ease up so I don't hurt you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voice a whisper)<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're getting better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[They get back into fighting positions again. The door opens, and Sheppard and Weir enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How're the Ninja lessons going, Jet Li?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We lost contact with the Taranans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You mean the volcano people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Super volcano people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What happened to them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Seeing how we lost contact with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They usually check in from time to time from their new settlement. We've been sending them food, medical supplies.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon signs for McKay to keep his eyes on Ronon's own, anticipating the next attack. McKay keeps his back to Sheppard and Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's the least we can do since getting the <i>Orion</i> blown up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But we haven't heard from them for a few months. I tried to contact them by radio, but no response.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, so send a MALP.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eh, we just did. Everything looks okay, but the, uh, settlement's a couple kilometers from the gate, so we don't know anything yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I want you to check it out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay lowers his hands and turns around, surprised.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shouts and strikes at that unguarded moment, again striking McKay in the shielded part of his abdomen. Sheppard winces in sympathy. McKay looks up, whimpering, and pantomimes he was supposed to keep his eyes on Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(nodding)<br />
Eyes. Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(drily)<br />
May want to change first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whimpering)<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Weir leave. McKay looks up to see Ronon approaching; he flinches, but Ronon just claps him on the shoulder as he too leaves. McKay sighs.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEW TENARA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team approaches the settlement. It is a small town, with well-masoned houses and shops.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They've gotten a lot done in the short time they've been here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, they're hard-working people. I've made several trips to assist them in getting settled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard from Atlantis calling anyone in the Taranan settlement. Please respond.</blockquote>
<p>[There is no response.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought I'd give it a shot. All right, let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts on his glasses, and they continue to the settlement.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TERANAN OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[The team enters an office, filled with furniture and equipment similar to Earth in the mid-twentieth century. The computers are modern.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Anybody home?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it looks like they abandoned the place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, maybe they found somewhere better to live.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They left everything behind. Why would they do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get these workstations powered up. Maybe we can figure out where these people went.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. I got something. A single lifesign.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's below us.</blockquote>
<p>[He studies the device, showing a single blip far underground.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Quite a way below us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They built underground?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. One of the previous civilizations that lived here was similar to the Genii, living below the surface to avoid detection by the Wraith. They left behind several underground passages, but the Taranans didn't utilize them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, someone is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How do we get there?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla leads the way.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TERANAN UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS</b>
</p><p>[Ronon is the last to repel down to the chamber, sliding down easily in one swoop. They turn on the flashlights on their rifles. The area is a cement underground bunker.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay points, and Sheppard leads the way down a corridor. The team patrols together, Ronon checking a side passage, and watching their rear. Teyla opens a door, finding a mucus-encrusted large sack.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Whoa! What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It looks like a cocoon of some sort.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's inside it?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stoops to investigate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, whatever it is, it's not inside anymore.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at the empty cocoon. McKay continues to watch the single life sign as the team exchange worried looks.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir approaches Chuck.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Has Colonel Sheppard's team dialed in with a status report yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Well, not yet, but they haven't been gone that long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go ahead and dial them.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck does so.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TERANAN UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between Atlantis and Sheppard's team.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
How's it going there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think I know why we lost contact with the Taranans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What? All of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like it. The entire settlement is deserted. Rodney's picked up a lifesign underneath the tunnel, but we're tracking it. We don't think it's human, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We discovered a large cocoon in one of the rooms under the settlement. We think whatever hatched from it is what we're detecting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Did you just say "cocoon"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, it's like a big, slimy&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a pod.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was going to say "egg," but who knows what the hell it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sending in back up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We can handle it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know you can handle it, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. I'll send in a team of Marines to assist you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(resigned)<br />
All right, if you feel the need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I feel the need. Weir out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's lifesigns detector starts beeping more rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a hell of a complex down here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's like a maze.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're closer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Forty meters? It's stopped moving, so we're gaining ground.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances back to the rest of his team.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, good. Look, if it makes any sudden moves, I want you to make sure that&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Belatedly, Sheppard realizes that Ronon has disappeared.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Ronon? Ronon!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TERANAN UNDERGROUND ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(coughing)<br />
In here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks disgusted and upset. His teammates join him to see the source of his distress. It is filled with human corpses piled onto each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, my God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Taranans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wounds on their neck, all of them. Does this look familiar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Looks disturbingly familiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't think, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He looks up, noticing Ronon has once again disappeared.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon?<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Oh, for God's sakes&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(calling from another room)<br />
In here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;IRATUS BUG LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay join Ronon in this lab. Ronon is looking at a table with straps to hold down humans. An iratus bug sits in a liquid chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can't wander off like that. You got to&#8230;<br />
(noticing the room's contents)<br />
Oh, no&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Iratus bug.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hate those things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That explains why the wounds look so familiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it doing here? Iratus bugs are not indigenous to this planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, somebody brought it here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let's hope it's the only bug they brought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, some kind of a Wraith experiment?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I doubt the Taranans did this to themselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not sense any Wraith in the settlement.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay notices his detector beeping more rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh&#8230;our little friend is on the move. It's headed right for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How fast?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Very fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It knows we're here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon heads out to meet the threat.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon. Stun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(furious)<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stun!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sets his gun as they all warily watch the room of corpses, looking for danger. McKay's scanner beeping quickly. They watch, growing increasingly nervous.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEGLEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard jumps, startled.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEW TARANAS FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Negley's team of marines patrols the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEGLEY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, this is Lieutenant Negley, do you copy?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;IRATUS BUG LAB</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the forest and underground chamber.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispering, impatient)<br />
Yes, Lieutenant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEGLEY<br />
Sir, my team has just come through the gate, and we're proceeding to the settlement north&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(cutting him off sharply)<br />
Great, terrific. We'll meet you there. Right now I need radio silence. Sheppard out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks the steady beeping of his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It stopped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How am I supposed to know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I think it's out in the tunnel.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leads the way.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, TERANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team warily goes through the room of corpses and out into the tunnel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispering)<br />
It's close.</blockquote>
<p>[They cautiously move forward. From a side passage, a half-man, half-insect creature attacks Ronon, pinning him to the wall. Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay open fire on it. It screams in pain and backs off, knocking down Sheppard. Ronon unsheathes his sword and chops off one of its limbs. It runs down the hall on its human legs. They continue to shoot at it as it disappears down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, I'm good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the hell was that thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(looking down)<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon crouches with a sigh and picks up the appendage he sliced off. It looks like a forearm with a three-fingered insect "hand".]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's a piece of an arm, it looks like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's hope that slows him down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe it'll bleed to death.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Or just grow another arm.</blockquote>
<p>[He drops the arm back onto the floor.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;TARANAS SETTLEMENT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Negley's team are still close to the Stargate when they hear the wormhole activating behind them. Negley turns to spot a dart flying through.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEGLEY<br />
Dart!</blockquote>
<p>[His team take defensive positions and start to fire on it, but the dart's culling beam swallows them all.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAS UNDERGROUND COMPLEX</b>
</p><p>[McKay watches his scanner, tracking the creature.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's still moving away from us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's hope losing a chunk of his arm slows him down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to finish it off to make sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Couldn't agree with you more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, and how are we going to do that? Huh? Am I the only one who noticed that our bullets had no effect on it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It appears to have a hardened shell on its back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(indicating Ronon's gun)<br />
Set that thing to "kill" again.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard. How far away from the settlement are you? Negley, this is Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You did say "radio silence."</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried, into radio)<br />
Negley. Respond!<br />
(frustrated)<br />
Aw, great.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay taps Sheppard on the arm and points to a side passage.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's through that doorway.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard heads to a sealed metal door. Getting into defensive positions, they open it, then cautiously step inside. They find a room filled with cocoons.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is not good.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Chuck enters the office. Weir is at her desk, studying some papers.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Dr. Weir, we just received a data transmission from the Taranan settlement&#8230; Lieutenant Negley, checking in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And how're they doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Well, they've contacted Colonel Sheppard's team, who are about ten kilometers further inland from the settlement. Negley and his team are on their way to meet up with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ten kilometers inland? What are they doing there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Well, they found the Taranans. Apparently they've abandoned their settlement for a better location inland.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What about the cocoon, and the lifesign they were tracking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
There was no mention about it. It was a brief transmission. They were almost out of range.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. Good. Keep me posted.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon exit the room, rejoining Teyla and McKay, already in the hall.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We searched the whole room. That thing ain't in there. Just a bunch of unhatched eggs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Pods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whatever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is there another way out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, that's the only door to the room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, they must've found another way out, because it is still on the move.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks up at the ceiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
<i>Alien</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[They all stare blankly at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The movie <i>Alien</i>. They use the airshafts to move around the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
And then systematically killed the entire crew, one by one. Thank you for bringing that up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(innocently)<br />
They didn't kill them all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What do we do now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Track this thing down and kill it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Agreed, but&#8230;first things first.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;POD ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team sets C-4 explosives on the various cocoon pods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The structure is very peculiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah&#8230;I believe the word is "disgusting."</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon unsheathes his sword and looks around.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;POD ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla approaches. One of the creatures starts to break through, grabbing at Teyla and McKay. They both back away, frightened.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
Go! Go! Go! Go! Sheppard! They're hatching!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sets the last explosive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're good! Let's go!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon spins to see Teyla, McKay and Sheppard running out. A creature growls behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Shut the door. Shut the door!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard shove the door closed, but the creature gets two of its appendages leaning out. Sheppard aims his rifle inside the room and fires. The creature drops back, screaming. They seal the door and run for cover. Once they are a safe distance, Sheppard keys his remote detonator.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Fire in the hole.</blockquote>
<p>[A fireball appears further down the hall where the chamber was.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Everyone okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think you singed my eyebrows. Think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?</blockquote>
<p>[The others ignore McKay as they go investigate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;POD ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The room is filled with smoke and debris. The pods have been destroyed. McKay looks at his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think we got them all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Except for our armless friend. He's still on the move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go get him.</blockquote>
<p>[They leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard. do you read? Negley? Respond.<br />
(to self)<br />
Dammit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps they encountered the creature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And what, it killed all four of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No way. One creature isn't going to take out four Marines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It almost killed all of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
But it didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

Obviously it knows its way around this place better than we do. Perhaps we should consider returning to the gate.</blockquote>

No, not give up. We can find out what happened to the Marines and request additional backup so that we may do a proper search of the settlement.</blockquote>

I meant it looked like it had two arms and two legs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It looked like a giant bug to me. I hate those things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If it was indeed a Wraith experiment, well, perhaps it was created by combining the genetic elements of the Iratus bug with the Taranans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which is, as we know, exactly how the Wraith evolved. The Iratus bug bites human, human DNA mixes with theirs, a thousand years go by&#8212;Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So, what, they're trying to create more Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That doesn't make any more sense. If they wanted to create more Wraith, wouldn't it be easier to get a male and female, you know&#8230;get a room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
And I have no problem with dying. Because even if you kill me right now&#8230;I'll die knowing that you and your team did not get off this planet alive.</blockquote>
<p>[The creature attacks Sheppard, throwing him down the corridor. Michael runs away. From the other direction, Ronon arrives, blasting the creature off of Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and McKay hurry to where their rappelling equipment is hooked up.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Rope climbing's the reason I got bronze instead of silver in the ParticipAction program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Creatures get closer. Teyla looks down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hurry! They're coming!</blockquote>
<p>[She fires at them while McKay hurries to climb up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TARANAN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard run down the corridor, firing at creatures as they meet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is messed up. 
(seeing something to the side)<br />
This must be where they got up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Air shafts. It's about time we used them.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Ronon climb into an air shaft ladder.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;TARANAN FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon reach the surface. Ronon blasts away some creatures trying to follow them. They look around, spotting a dart parked on the surface.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Michael's.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No doubt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You thinking what I'm thinking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I fly it, pick you, Rodney, and Teyla up. We use the dart's DHD to dial the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(considering)<br />
I was thinking "blow it up," but your idea's better. Get moving.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard runs to the dart. Ronon blasts some creatures climbing up the air shaft. He hears more converging on them in the forest. They appear out of the fog, surrounding him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sheppard!</blockquote>
<p>[The dart powers up. Ronon starts firing on them. The dart culls Ronon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEW TARANAS FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and McKay run through the forest. McKay checks his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lifesigns up ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard? Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[They hear the creatures growling nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Doesn't sound like it. Lifesigns behind us, too. It's closing in fast. Oh, god.</blockquote>
<p>[The scanner beeps frantically and McKay spots dots on all sides drawing closer to Teyla and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're surrounded.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and McKay stand back to back, searching for enemies. Teyla is hit by a Wraith stun blast. She falls. McKay turns, but he too is felled by the stunner. Michael strides forward. A dart flies overhead. It culls Teyla and McKay before Michael can get to them. He breathes heavily, looking frustrated.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activates. Weir approaches Chuck's station.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Incoming wormhole. Colonel Sheppard's IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Lower the shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The shield lowers as Weir approaches the Stargate. Sheppard's team walks through.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you all right? Where are the marines?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Didn't make it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We barely made it ourselves. We had to commandeer a Wraith dart just to dial out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We ditched it on another planet. We didn't want to risk damaging the control room. <i>Daedalus</i> can pick it up later.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What happened to the Taranans?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They're dead, all of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Wait a minute. Lieutenant Negley sent a message saying they just relocated to a new settlement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. It was Michael. He sent the transmission. He's the one that's killed the Taranans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(shocked)<br />
Michael?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll tell you about it in a minute, but first, is the <i>Daedalus</i> here yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's still a few days out. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're going to need it to make another stop on the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir walks down a corridor, deep in thought and looking disturbed. Teyla meets her in the passageway and notices her demeanor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Elizabeth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I just came from McKay's lab. He's been examining the research he was able to upload from Michael's experiment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Has he been able to determine just how many more of those creatures Michael was able to create?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, not an exact figure, no, but Rodney believes it's well into the hundreds.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla gasps in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, and it appears Michael has similar labs on at least three different planets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's amazing how quickly he's been able to incorporate our science into his.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir is still deep in thought.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Michael found out about the Taranan settlement through information the Wraith hacked from our database during our brief alliance with them last year. We led Michael straight to them.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir studies a tablet computer. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel Caldwell just radioed. They did a full sweep of the planet. No lifesigns. They searched the settlement. No Michael, no creatures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He already dialed out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yep. Got the control crystal back in the DHD. Rodney's trying to figure out the last address dialed, but, uh, well, you know how long that takes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, I'm sure Michael immediately dialed elsewhere to cover his tracks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, you can count on that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We need to find him. He's already too dangerous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And I'm sure we're number one on his hit list.</blockquote>
