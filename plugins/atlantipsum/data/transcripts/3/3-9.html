<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay walk with Weir towards the Control Room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Elizabeth, we may have a situation. Major Leonard's team? They're late returning from M1B-129.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We sent them to check out an unusual energy reading, correct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. An anomalous spike the MALP picked up on a 'gate scout. The planet is uninhabited, but I thought it warranted a closer look.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The point is, they missed a check-in. They're now six hours overdue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We tried contacting them by the radio, but, uh, signal is intermittent at best. It's just a lot of static. It could have something to do with the anomaly, but I'm not sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I want to take our team, go see what happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of course. Take an additional marine unit as well and&#8230;the good Doctor Beckett, just in case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD AND MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, STARGATE AREA, M1B-129, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team, Beckett, and a marine unit come through the active wormhole. A MALP sits to the side of the Stargate. No one is around.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major Leonard, this is Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<p>[The others wince and take out their earpieces from the feedback Sheppard's transmission caused.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major Leonard?</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls out his own earpiece.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
These things are useless.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies his handheld computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm picking up that puzzling energy reading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Did I not just use the word "puzzling"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Charming.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon crouches down, studying the soil.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Tracks. Boot prints.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go find them.</blockquote>
<p>[The group head out in the direction of the tracks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, M1B-129, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The readings are stronger. Whatever it is? We're getting warmer.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett spots someone lying in path ahead.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look!</blockquote>
<p>[They approach. The body is so decomposed, its remains are mostly skeletal. From what is left of its clothing, the material looks Genii. Beckett examines the body.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Genii.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's been dead for months.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
No. Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, we know our guys didn't do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And he wasn't fed on, so it wasn't the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Bullet wounds, dozens of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Over here.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and the others head over to Ronon. He stands over two more Genii bodies. They are in similar states of decomposition. Beckett leans over one of the bodies.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Also shot.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard toes the other with his boot.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This guy was stabbed. Repeatedly, it looks like.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon has found another body further in the bushes. Its skeletal hand still clutches a knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
By this guy, looks like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, so they killed each other?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. Quite possibly. And by the looks of it, in a violent fashion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried)<br />
Which begs the question, what the hell happened to Major Leonard's team?</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST</b>
</p><p>[The group walks along a wide, groomed path.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I thought you said this planet was uninhabited.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, according to the Ancient database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it recently became "habited".</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Do you suppose the Genii are responsible for the energy readings we're detecting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Probably. It's be just our luck if we stumbled on one of their nuclear testing sites.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAGAN<br />
(worried)<br />
Nuclear testing site?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just a small one.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon suddenly stops, alert, raising his weapon. The others quickly follow his lead, searching for any danger.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I saw something.</blockquote>
<p>[Nothing appears through the trees.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatiently)<br />
Well, what?! Person, animal? How many syllables?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(calling out)<br />
Leonard!</blockquote>
<p>[There is no response. Ronon finally lowers his weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's probably nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[The team sighs and continues on.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to himself)<br />
Why am I not comforted?</blockquote>
<p>[The team continues until they get close to a cave. McKay's scanner starts beeping more rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispering)<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<p>[He points to the cave. The team warily advances, weapons raised. Sheppard looks through the entrance.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's go check it out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE</b>
</p><p>[The team advances. The walls don't appear to be natural stone, more like the inside of a Wraith ship. One area has what looks to be Genii level of technology with cables threading outward. Sheppard spots another Genii corpse tangled amongst the cords.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doc?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh for god's sake, enough with the bodies!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(kneeling by the body)<br />
Head's snapped completely around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
By him?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla has found another body near equipment. Beckett heads over.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Quite possibly&#8230;and then he shot himself. Lovely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wraith bunker, but no Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ah, it appears to have been abandoned for some time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Genii probably stumbled onto it just like we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And then promptly killed each other. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, another Hardy Boys mystery. In here.</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures towards another chamber, where the cords lead.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
All right. We'll check it out. You and Ronon check out the immediate area around the cave. Keep an eye out for our friends, all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods as they head their separate ways.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CONTROL CHAMBER, CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Several tendrils are spread out everywhere in the chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It appears to be organic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just like the energy conduit aboard a Wraith ship&#8230;and every bit of disgusting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Possibly.</blockquote>
<p>[Lights go on inside the chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(warily)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(intrigued)<br />
Huh, we got power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's this, now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, this is it. Ground zero for the energy readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This thing's still active?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Apparently so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
Actively doing what, exactly?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay works his way through the tendrils to the center.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's some sort of&#8230;EM generator. It's emitting a modulating ultra-low frequency pulse. These, uh, energy conduits are acting almost like antennae.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Is that what's interfering with the radio communications?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, probably. The Genii must've found this place, activated it somehow, and they couldn't figure out how to turn it off. So, they did whatever any other good "soldier" would do in their situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shot the hell out of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Looks like it's healing itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, it's the beauty of hybrid organic design.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAGAN<br />
(nervously)<br />
Th-this frequency. Can it hurt us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. It's doubtful. Apart from the obvious sterility issues.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAGAN<br />
Wha-what?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's kidding&#8230;you're kidding, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(noncommittally)<br />
Eh.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla runs into the chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel! We've found the team.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, M1B-129, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The rescue party stand around the bodies of three of the missing team.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, so&#8230;where's Major Leonard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We were unable to locate his body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
They were killed by MP-5 fire. All three of them. Shot multiple times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! A camera!</blockquote>
<p>[He picks up a small camcorder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look at this.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens the viewscreen and plays back the recording.]
</p><p><b>VIDEO</b>
</p><p>[On it appears Leonard's team walking through the forest of M1B-129. The rearmost team member holds the camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGENT<br />
(narrating over video)<br />
Okay, it's a road leading from the Stargate&#8230;kinda wish there was a burger stand or something around here. I'm starving.</blockquote>
<p>[The camera abruptly switches scenes with a burst of static. The new image shows the team finding the Genii soldiers Sheppard's team encountered in the woods.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEONARD<br />
(on videotape)<br />
More of them.</blockquote>
<p>[The camera switches scenes again. Now it records the cave, panning the central chamber and across the Genii bodies.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGENT<br />
Oh, god! More bodies in here!</blockquote>
<p>[The camera scene switches again. They're still in the cave, but doing a more close up picture of the skeleton.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGENT<br />
What is this place?</blockquote>
<p>[A burst of automatic gunfire sounds from outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGENT<br />
Who's that?</blockquote>
<p>[He and his teammate run outside. Largent still holds the camera as he runs.]
</p><p>[The camera switches scenes again. This time, it appears the camera was turned on accidentally. The picture is from hip-height. Largent and one of his teammates run through the woods towards the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGENT<br />
We're not going to make it!</blockquote>
<p>[His teammate gets struck from behind by a bullet and falls, reflexively firing his own weapon as he hits the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGENT<br />
(frightened)<br />
<i>Prometheus</i>, this is Largent! Where the hell are you!</blockquote>
<p>[He continues running, then falls wounded himself, shot from behind. The camera falls on the ground, capturing the image of Major Leonard running past, shooting ahead of him.]
</p><p><b>END VIDEO</b>
</p><p>[McKay switches off the camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(perplexed)<br />
He was calling for the <i>Prometheus</i>. That ship was destroyed last year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(incredulous)<br />
Major Leonard killed his own men? Why would he do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe whatever caused the Genii to turn on each other did the same thing to our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That bloody machine back there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No! We need to head back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? No. We can't leave. Look, the generator's still running.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I have to at least figure out its purpose. They're probably right. It may somehow be linked to all of this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, then we'll come back. But first things first, we have to transport our dead back to Atlantis. Then we'll return with more units and search for Major Leonard.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, M1B-129, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team walk through the woods. Sheppard leads. Beckett and Mckay carry one field-made stretcher. Two of the marines carry the second. Ronon helps the third marine with the last body. Teyla brings up the rear of the procession.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can we stop for a second?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grunting with effort)<br />
Look, I mean no disrespect, but this guy's heavy, and ever since I was shot in the ass by an arrow, I've been prone to sciatica&#8230;No?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon spots a misty object moving quickly through the woods, like when the Wraith try to confuse their prey.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(hissing)<br />
Down, down down!</blockquote>
<p>[He lowers the stretcher to the ground, crouching. The others follow suit. Ronon raises his pistol. Sheppard runs down the line to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Both he and Ronon look carefully, but spot nothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon grimaces, holstering his weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard signals to keep moving to the Stargate as he resumes his place at the front.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, M1B-129, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The group reaches the Stargate, lowering their stretchers to the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sergeant, dial the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p>[The marine heads to the DHD. As soon as he presses the first glyph, the DHD explodes, the repercussion rocking the whole area, knocking everyone off their feet. Sheppard regains his equilibrium first, looking towards the marine sergeant who was closest to the blast, and is lying on the ground, unmoving.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Right!</blockquote>
<p>[He struggles to his feet, patting Barasso on the arm as he passes.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Get my medical kit!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard checks the sergeant's neck for a pulse.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's dead.</blockquote>
<p>[As Barasso reaches for Beckett's kit, he's shot by automatic weapons fire. He falls with a cry. Everyone takes cover.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wraith!</blockquote>
<p>[He fires back at the assailant. Sheppard pulls Barasso to better cover.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not Wraith! It's automatic gunfire!</blockquote>
<p>[He spots Leonard firing on them from a distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Leonard! Stand down! It's Sheppard!</blockquote>
<p>[Leonard falls back. McKay reaches Beckett and a wounded Kagan, covering them with his pistol. Beckett takes the opportunity to scramble for his pack. Ronon gives chase to Leonard. Kagan clutches his abdomen with bloody hands, grunting with pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAGAN<br />
How bad is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You'll be fine, son. Just lie back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Leonard!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon paces the perimeter, clearly annoyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(frustrated)<br />
He's gone!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla treats Barasso. Beckett places a pressure bandage on Kagan's wound while Kagan writhes in agony.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(soothing)<br />
Easy, easy. You'll be all right. You'll be all right, son. Hey&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He cradles Kagan's head in his arms and looks to Teyla and Barasso.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to Barasso)<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
(in shock)<br />
Yeah, I think so.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay holsters his sidearm and heads over to the DHD. The inside is complete exposed, and all the control crystals are shattered to tiny pieces. Sheppard joins him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We are unbelievably screwed.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett continues to treat the two wounded soldiers. Ronon drags the dead sergeant to the other bodies.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAGAN<br />
(panicking)<br />
It's bad, isn't it? Am I going to die?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(determined)<br />
Look at me. Look at me! Not if I have any say!<br />
(looking over at Teyla and Barasso)<br />
Teyla, keep pressure on the wound. We need to stop that bleeding!<br />
(to Kagan)<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[He continues treating Kagan who winces in pain.]
</p><p>[McKay has his tablet computer connected to the vestiges of the DHD. Sheppard stands beside him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is there any other way to dial?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(in disbelief)<br />
Huh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And don't say no if there is <i>any</i>  possibility because I am not in the mood for any of your usual "impossible heroics" game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(protesting)<br />
I wouldn't do that!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glares. Ronon approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, no. Even if we could somehow manually dial, there's no power. Your pal Major Looney Tunes knew exactly where to set the charge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to go after him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, what we need to do is go back to the bunker.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're overdue. Elizabeth will contact us through the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And she'll probably only get static, remember? Look, as long as that generator is emitting that pulse, we'll have little if any chance of responding to Atlantis if they radio. No, you want to get out of here? I need to shut that thing down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(calling to everyone)<br />
All right, we'll leave the dead here. We'll get 'em when we come back.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The group trudge back to the cave area. Beckett helps Barasso, keeping pressure on the bandage on his left shoulder. Ronon and McKay carry Kagan on a stretcher.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAGAN<br />
I'm sorry about this, Doctor McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(compassionately)<br />
Hey, you don't worry about me. You just hang in there, okay?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE</b>
</p><p>[They've arrived at the cave. McKay and Teyla work in the central core.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teyla, you want to hold this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Barasso sits against a wall. Kagan lies on a table, Beckett working on him. Sheppard calls Beckett over out of hearing range.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doc? Are they going to be okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Barasso's shoulder's still bleeding internally, but I should be able to keep it in check. It's Lieutenant Kagan I'm worried about. He suffered severe penetrating abdominal trauma. He needs complicated surgery, blood transfusions, and all I've here is my medical kit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, you do what you can to keep alive, okay? We're gonna get out of here soon.</blockquote>
<p>[He moves to go.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel&#8230;I'm afraid for Lieutenant Kagan, "soon" may only be a matter of minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sighs in frustration as he heads to McKay and Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, you see right here? According to these readings, if I cut through that membrane, there should be several actuator coils underneath. Well&#8230;it's Wraith tech, so it's more like actuator veins. Now if I can isolate the primary conduit, follow it straight back to the core.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Glad to see you've got it all worked out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulantly)<br />
Definitely not all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatient)<br />
Some?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, very little. Look, I can only surmise that it's some sort of Wraith&#8230;experiment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(frustrated)<br />
I am trying to impress upon Doctor McKay that determining how to turn the thing off is more pressing than learning what it actually does.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't even know what it does?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I can now state for certain that it is in fact a generator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We already knew that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, the EM pulse it's emitting is-is very peculiar. It-it's fluctuating in-in systematic intervals along the ultra-low frequency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is that what made all these people kill each other?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I hope so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You hope so?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Otherwise, there are two bizarre things going on, and one is more than enough for me, thank you very much.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla look frustrated and worried.]

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There.</blockquote>
<p>[The tablet computer in his hand beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What? Power levels are still rising. No, no, no-no-no-no-no-no. No, that's impossible. Okay&#8230;that's not right.</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries over to check a laptop computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Temperature level should be dropping, not rising. Okay, this is nuts. Carson! Carson, get in here! I need your help!</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(calling from other room)<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett breathes a sigh of relief as he takes off his stethoscope, fully focused on Kagan.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's back. Thank God. Nice job.</blockquote>
<p>[Barasso leaves, heading for Beckett's left hand side. McKay rushes in from the core room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson! Look, didn't you hear me? I've been calling you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Not now, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I need your help! It is physically impossible for me to isolate the conduits <i>and</i> monitor the laptops at the same time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Lieutenant Kagan needs me. We nearly lost him just now! We were barely able to restart his heartbeat. I'm not about to abandon him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(concerned)<br />
Who's we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Sergeant Barasso and I.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett nods with his chin, pointing out where Barasso took off to his left. McKay's eyes sweep the area, coming to a spot far to Beckett's right.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(gently)<br />
Carson&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(annoyed)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett follows McKay's gaze. Barasso is sitting against the cave wall in the spot he had first taken when they all first returned to the cave. His eyes are open&#8212;he is clearly dead. Beckett looks at him in shock and slowly walks over, touching Barasso's face.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Cold&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He tries to lift Barasso's arm. It barely budges.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(upset)<br />
Rigor mortis&#8230;that's impossible. He was just helping me.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay comes over and lays a hand on Beckett's shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on. We need to turn that generator off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(still in shock)<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(pain)<br />
John? Major Leonard is dead. There is no more danger. Now I need you&#8230;to get me&#8230;to Doctor Beckett! I can't walk&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard holds up a hand for silence.]

</p><p>[Sheppard spots a Taliban warrior scoping out their position. The man's position is where Ronon is truly standing in the forest.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon uses a monocular to check the entrance. He sees a Wraith keeping watch where Sheppard truly is.]
</p><p>[Both Sheppard and Ronon take cover within their respective illusions. Ronon then comes out firing.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN DESERT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sees the Taliban soldier rushing forward, shooting at him. He fires back.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon barely reaches a tree trunk for cover as Sheppard's P-90 fire strikes the area he's standing in. He fires back.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHELTER</b>
</p><p>[Ronon's blast strikes the shelter wall a few feet away from Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(shouting desperately)<br />
Ronon, don't shoot! It's us!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN DESERT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard continues to fire at the "Taliban warrior", finally hitting him. The man goes down, but quickly gets to his feet again, hurrying out of range.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHELTER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard comes to Teyla, trying to help her up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Clipped him in the arm. Not enough to kill him; enough to scare him off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's probably calling his buddies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(protesting)<br />
John, don't! Ugh!</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls her upright and heads out of the shelter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(ignoring)<br />
We've got to get out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon rips off a piece of his shirt and wraps it around his injured arm using one hand and his teeth.]
</p><p>[In another part of the forest, Sheppard hurries the injured Teyla along.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(reassuring)<br />
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of his friends.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks at Sheppard with alarm as she tries to keep up with his fast pace.]

<p>[A computer beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No&#8230;no! Look, the one on the left. Carson, come on! Pay attention.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay moves over to where Beckett is struggling with the different lines.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(frustrated)<br />
I'm trying damn it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
Doc!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett looks over. Barraso is gesturing from the other cave chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
Doc, come in here I need you!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett stops what he's doing and takes a step towards Barasso. McKay notices Beckett's action.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He needs me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(pointing)<br />
Sergeant Barasso.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands in front of Beckett, glancing back at the empty chamber behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I already told you, Barasso is dead. It's the EM generator. It's messing with your mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett still sees an agitated Barasso over McKay's shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
Kagan's crashed again! Get in here, Doc!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett starts forward, but McKay holds him back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, Carson, come on, I need you to concentrate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(yelling)<br />
For God's sake, Rodney, don't you see him?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(yelling)<br />
Look, Barasso is dead! And if we don't shut that generator down, we're going to be dead right along with him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
He's trying to stop you from saving Kagan's life! Don't let him!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett brushes past McKay, hurrying after Barasso.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts to go after him, but an alarm from one of the computers draws his attention.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh my god!</blockquote>
<p>[The computer reads "Overload Imminent".]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Beckett reaches Kagan. Barasso is at his side.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Move aside!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett checks Kagan's vitals.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We've got a pulse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
(bitter)<br />
Yeah, not for long if McKay keeps pulling you away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(yelling from other room)<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARASSO<br />
Come on, Doc. We need to get him out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett cradles the unconscious Kagan in his arms and leaves the cave, the imaginary Barasso following.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN DESERT RIDGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard helps the limping "Holland" along a dune ridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right now, easy. Easy.</blockquote>
<p>[He tries to ease Holland down, but they both end up tumbling down the steep dune. Holland cries in agony and clutches in injured leg. Sheppard gets to his feet, brushing the sand off himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
As much as I'd like to stop and take a break&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, am I slowing you down? I'm sorry. Are we even going in the right direction?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks around, pointing the direction they're headed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
West.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
(glancing in the direction Sheppard indicated)<br />
It looks east to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(insistently)<br />
It's west!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
'Cause there's a whole mess of Taliban just east of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know what? When we get back to Kandahar, you're buying the next two rounds!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shifts to try and figure out how best to help Holland to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, can you stand?</blockquote>
<p>[He helps Holland up, taking most of his weight.]
</p>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
Stand? Sure. Walk&#8230;? We'll see.</blockquote>
<p>[They limp a few steps.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(encouraging)<br />
All right, all right, see? Not so bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
Just keep going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See how the sun's moving? That's west.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
Whatever.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN, DESERT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Later, Holland and Sheppard lie hidden at the top of a ridge. Several Taliban are gathered near two large truck.]
</p>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
West.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns around to take a cautious look, and immediately ducks from fire by the Taliban. He fires back, striking one of the trucks and making it explode. Soon the other truck also explodes. The Taliban scatter, and Sheppard and Holland limp away hurriedly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon runs through the forest, pausing and looking through the trees. He raises his gun to fire on the "Wraith", but sees it's got Teyla with it.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon gives chase.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE CORE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicking)<br />
Come on! Shut down!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at another computer, which is now counting down less than twenty seconds to a core overload.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh no! Carson! We need to get out of here right now!</blockquote>
<p>[He pauses at the outer chamber, and looks around, seeing no one.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay runs past Barasso's body.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CAVE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay runs several feet outside the cave before diving for cover before the explosion. After several seconds, nothing happens. McKay turns over, looking confused.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the hell? Why didn't it explode?</blockquote>
<p>[He stands and stares at the quiet cave entrance.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's happening to me, too.</blockquote>
<p>[There are footsteps behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns to see Sheppard carrying Teyla in his arms. Sheppard stops upon spotting McKay and drops Teyla's legs to raise his weapon. McKay puts up his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John, no!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoves Sheppard's arm as he fires, knocking off Sheppard's aim. McKay is hit in his left side and falls.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon hears the shot and heads in that direction.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN DESERT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard passes by the wounded "Taliban warrior", who's lying in shock, pleading in Pashtun. Sheppard lowers Holland next to the wounded enemy and crouches down next to him, grabbing his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Arclight, this is Roundhouse Zero Six. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
(weakly)<br />
Sheppard&#8230;whatever happens, thanks for coming for me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard bites his lip, looking very worried.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CAVE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon reaches the treeline near the caves. He sees the "Wraith" sitting next to wounded Teyla and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Arclight, this is Roundhouse Zero Six. Do you read? Arclight, this is Roundhouse Zero Six. Do you read?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla struggles to sit up. She glances over at McKay, who is still conscious and pale with pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(desperate)<br />
I already told you how to fix it. Cut the power.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks at Sheppard, who's still focused on the radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(frustrated, into radio)<br />
Arclight, respond! We need to get the hell out of here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(pained)<br />
The interference is coming from in there.</blockquote>
<p>[She points to the cave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN DESERT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard looks where she pointed. All he sees is open desert.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's nothing there but sand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(insistent)<br />
There is an entrance to a cave!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's nothing there!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla grabs Sheppard by the vest and forces him to listen.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(desperately)<br />
John! You have to trust me! Now the enemy is jamming our radio signal! You have to disconnect the power. I can show you how, but you have to take me in there!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon aims towards the Wraith and fires. His shot goes wide, striking the cave.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Take me in there now!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pulls Teyla to her feet and hurries her inside the cave, dodging Ronon's blasts. She cries out in pain as she tries to move with him. Ronon starts to run after them. McKay watches his approach with alarm.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORE CHAMBER, CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard helps Teyla get to where McKay's tablet still sits. She grabs it and studies the readout. She moans with emotion.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to herself)<br />
Rodney, you were almost done, why did you stop?<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Reach in there&#8230;the largest cord. Follow it with your hand until you reach the end.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks confused. Teyla reaches over and grabs his lapel.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(forceful)<br />
Do it, John! Then you can&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;AFGHANISTAN DESERT, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>HOLLAND<br />
(continuing)<br />
&#8230;radio for help and get us out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CENTRAL CORE CHAMBER, CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla releases Sheppard. With constant looks back, still skeptical, Sheppard reaches forward, feeling for the biggest cord. Teyla watches his progress from her computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There&#8230;that's it!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon enters the cave, his gun at ready. He starts approaching.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Pull it!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon enters the chamber, his gun aimed at Sheppard's head. Sheppard pulls the cord. It vibrates and glows for a brief moment, then shorts out. Teyla sighs with relief. Sheppard stares at the cord, blinking. He and Teyla turn, sensing someone behind them. Ronon stares at them in shock, still holding his gun at Sheppard's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(warily)<br />
Ronon&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(confused)<br />
Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, buddy, you want to lower your gun?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stares at his outstretched arm, and lowers his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What the hell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah&#8230;I know. Let's get the hell out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs and weeps in relief.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard searches the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Beckett?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard runs to where a shocked Beckett sits by a fallen tree, Kagan's pale body cradled in his lap.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I turned the damn thing off. It's over.</blockquote>
<p>[He pauses and looks at Kagan's still form.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Kagan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(flatly)<br />
He's alive.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir stands, speaking into her radio. Zelenka is on a nearby station.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I know you can't dial back in, but I could at least send more personnel through to help with the wounded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Beckett says he can handle it. <i>Daedalus</i> should be here by night.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CAVE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett treats McKay's bullet wound. Ronon sits in the shade of the tree. Kagan is lying on a stretcher, half in the shade. Teyla sits nearby. Sheppard paces the area, holding his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
And, uh, I think we can make it with the supplies you sent.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between the Atlantis control room and the cave area.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How are Rodney and Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whining)<br />
He shot me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
They're both fine, and uh, I think Kagan's out of the woods too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, you shot me!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard winces before picking up his radio again.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And none of you experienced any after effects from this Wraith device?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, I mean, we're all pretty creeped out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It was the most unsettling thing I've ever experienced.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard tries to ignore Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(keying radio)<br />
But&#8230;we're gonna be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, we'll check in in a few hours. Weir out.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard puts down his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(accusingly)<br />
You shot me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, Rodney, I shot you! And I said I was sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You shot me, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(upset)<br />
I'm sorry for shooting everyone! Just&#8230;the <i>Daedalus</i> will be here in a little while. Just&#8230;get some rest.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits next to Teyla with a sigh.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So&#8230;did you manage to get Captain Holland to safety?</blockquote>
<p>[A host of emotions flickers over Sheppard's face.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
Well&#8230;we survived.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods, still looking guilty.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes. We did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't believe you shot me!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with long-suffering air)<br />
Get some sleep, Rodney.</blockquote>
