<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM AREA</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Teyla walk along the catwalk of the secoond floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This hero you speak of. He doesn't happen to have a name, does he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. The Athosian who spoke to me of his deeds simply referred to him as a-a great hero of the town&#8212;a warrior who possesses almost "superhuman-like" powers.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon joins them on their way to the staircase.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm. Well, we've sent people to this planet before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, they're good traders and kind people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't recall there being many "superheroes."</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sounds like one of my people.</blockquote>
<p>[They all laugh.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, whoever it is, it would be nice to have someone like that on our side.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Beckett await at the bottom of the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Provided the rumors are true. Sounds to me like someone's imagination's run a little wild.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
As I said, my fellow Athosian who spoke to me of this hero, saw him in action against several armed men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I do that all the time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay comes running up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
I'm here, I'm here. I just had to get my autograph book in case, uh, Teyla's superhero turned out to be the real deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, at the very least, see if you can establish trade relations with the townspeople.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Control Room)<br />
Dial the gate.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ALIEN VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PATH TO VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team head to the village. Some villagers working in the gardens watch them pass by.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My childhood hero was Evel Knieval.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Was he not evil?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nah, that was just his name. He was a daredevil&#8230;which isn't kind of a devil&#8230;He just jumped motorcycles over things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just because. Didn't always make it, either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And you greatly admired this behavior?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, I just&#8230;look, at least my hero is human. McKay's is Batman!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. Misunderstood and unappreciated by many, his most formidable weapon was the power of his brilliant mind. Not just a hero&#8212;a superhero.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Dougie Angus Wood, the Highland Giant. Not only a hero, but a legend in Scotland.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Marke Hartoren. My first unit commander. He once fought and killed twelve enemy soldiers, gutting them with his bare hands. He was also a funny guy, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dryly)<br />
Yes, I can imagine the jokes and the entrails flying.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team enter the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Good day, travelers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
Good day to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
This is your first visit to our village?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Several of my people have said that you are good and fair traders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
We are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My fellow Athosians also speak of a great hero who protects this town.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Rumor has it he's a warrior with some impressive kills to his credit, including the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
This is true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then, uh, there's a good chance he is one of my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can you take us to him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Of course. This way.</blockquote>
<p>[Several villagers laugh in the square surrounding someone.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Here he is, the mightiest of heroes. Our champion protector&#8230;Lucius Lavin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, will you look who it is.</blockquote>
<p>[The team looks at each other in shock and disappointment.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You've got to be kidding me.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Lucius regales the town with more of his stories. The Atlantis team looks equal parts incredulous and bored at the familiar, if exaggerated story.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
As I lay there, the Iratus bug's tendrils just grasping my throat, choking me. I could feel my very life essence ebb and wane. With every passing second, I could feel myself drawing closer to death. Had I been the only one in that building&#8212;the only one in that burning building, I would've surrendered&#8230;and allowed sleep to overtake me. But there were women and children there with me whose very survival lay in my hands, and I'm not about to let them down. So I reached deep down within me, and I summoned whatever strength I had. And I grabbed that bug and I ripped him away. And through sheer force of will, I began to choke him and&#8230;ow ow ow! Ow!</blockquote>
<p>[He winces and whines very unheroically as Beckett injects him with a needle, taking a blood sample.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(to Carson)<br />
I thought you said that wasn't going to hurt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I lied.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(still rubbing his arm)<br />
Ow. And I-I sprang up, and I led them all to safety.</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers applaud.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, how'd you lead the people to safety?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You said the way out was blocked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh, you were listening. That's good. That's good. Because it was. It was blocked&#8230;until&#8230;I cleared a path through the burning wreckage. And ignoring the searing heat and the-the-the flames that were just swirling and swirling&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But how did you uh&#8212;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Okay. That's enough reminiscing for today. Believe me, there's plenty more where that story came from. So when we gather tomorrow, I'll tell you 'bout how I was almost seduced by a beautiful Ancient.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard does a double-take. The crowd disperses, muttering in excitement about Lucius's tales.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(dryly)<br />
Sounds entertaining.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, you'd think so, but between you and me, not so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, your stories are awfully fascinating&#8212;and familiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(sotto voce)<br />
All right, I admit, I took some "inspiration" from some of the mission reports that I perused while I was on Atlantis. But I spiced them. A little story here, a bit of a story there&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, I'm done here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, you're not going to find any trace of that special herb in my system. I learned my lesson the last time, thanks to all of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(suspicious)<br />
You mean these people are not drugged, they simply&#8230;"adore" you for who you are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah. Ain't it great?<br />
(surprised)<br />
You don't believe me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, Lucius, I have a lab set up. So, I think I'll just run the test anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You're wasting your time. In all modesty, these people love me, pure and true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lucius, you can't say anything modestly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I <i>saved</i> them. A couple of months ago, this bunch of ruffians come into town, start causing trouble. I beat 'em up, I chase 'em away. And all of a sudden, I'm the town hero. They give me gifts. The women are throwing themselves at me. It's like the old days, except better because now they're not drugged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(skeptically)<br />
Hang on, hang on. So you beat them up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yes. Me, I did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How'd you manage that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
It's not so hard&#8230;when you're invincible. I'm invincible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
All right. Looks like this going to take some convincing. Oh, let me see&#8230;.perfect.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks over to where some villagers are lifting a heavy pallet up to a second story using a pulley system.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Hey! Time for a demonstration.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is he&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius stands directly under the pallet.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Let it go. Trust me, trust me.</blockquote>
<p>[They let go of the rope pulley and the pallet crashed down upon Lucius. A green shield flickers around him, completely protecting him. Just like the Ancient shield McKay discovered a couple years ago.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh my god!</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius steps away, perfectly fine.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Hit me. Do it, come on, hit me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon eagerly steps forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I wouldn't. I'm telling ya, don't.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon punches Lucius and crushes his hand. He jumps around in considerable pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(smug)<br />
See? Invincible. I can't be "vinced."</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Lucius pulls out his shield device and places it on his outer clothes where it is visible to the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
As it turns out, I had this personal shield all along. It was a gift from one of my many admirers back at the old village&#8212;you know, before I was forced to pack up and leave&#8212;thank you very much. Anyway, I didn't even know what it was until I went to Atlantis&#8230;perused some of the mission reports about the Ancient devices that you guys discovered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You did an awful lot of "perusing" when you were on the base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I peruse. It's a gift.<br />
(to barmaid)<br />
Hey sweetheart, whaddya say you come by my place tonight, and&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
No thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Wait-wait-wait-wait! I'm the town hero.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
(scornfully)<br />
That was ages ago.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks away. Everyone else smirks.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(to team)<br />
Let me tell you something. You're only as good as your last rescue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
How is it that you're able to operate the Ancient technology without the ATA gene?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh, that was easy. All I had to do was find a guy with the gene, have him initiate the device. I mean, it took a long time, but you know once it was done, I could activate this thing any time I want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Fascinating. You do know those things run out of juice eventually, don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Come on, these Ancient things last forever. Look, lunch is on me. I'm gonna go take a walk. If I don't see you before you leave, well then, I'll just&#8230;uh, well I'll talk to ya later.</blockquote>
<p>[He tosses some coins on the table, stands, and puts on his coat.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not going anywhere until we get those test results.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(shrugs)<br />
Whatever you want. People to save.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well&#8230;what do you think?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps he's learned a lesson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's Lucius! Are you kidding me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's made a lot of mistakes in the past, but, uh, well who hasn't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why are you looking at me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, at least he's trying to do something good in order to get people to like him this time.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, I've completed my tests. Looks like Lucius is telling the truth. No traces of the drug in his system. He's clean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(standing)<br />
That's our cue to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wh-wh-wh-wait. Am I the only person here who thinks he is taking advantage of these poor people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
C'mon, Rodney, you just want another crack at that shield.</blockquote>
<p>[The others gather their gear and leave. Rodney stays seated at the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're damn right I do! Look, it can come in extremely handy. Look, he's practically wasting it!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team heads into the square. Among the crowd, they see the villager who first met them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Lucius?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
He went out for a stroll. He should be returning shortly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, whenever he gets back&#8230;tell him we said goodbye.</blockquote>
<p>[The team walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Uh, um&#8230;all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(low, to Sheppard)<br />
I think we're making a mistake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we'll have the Athosians keep an eye out on everyone. If anything gets out of control, we'll come back.</blockquote>
<p>[A woman screams. The team instantly draw their weapons. They're surrounded by armed humans. The crowd panics, then stills.]
</p>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
Drop your weapons or die where you stand.<br />
(after a pause)<br />
I said drop your weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not lookin' for a fight, we're just passing through town.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(low to Sheppard)<br />
I've got two on my right and one straight dead ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low)<br />
Two at twelve o'clock, one behind the fruit stand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(low, worried)<br />
If we act now, we risk injuring innocent villagers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low, worried)<br />
And us&#8230;we risk injuring us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(low)<br />
I can take my three out before they get a shot off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(low)<br />
There may be others hidden where we cannot see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's your call.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to ruffians)<br />
Here's the thing. If we all start shooting at each other, somebody's bound to get hurt. I can pretty much guarantee you'll be one of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
You this hero we've heard rumors of?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Amaris turns and walks over to the bystanders, grabbing the barmaid who brushed Lucius off earlier.]
</p>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
Come here. Come.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
No!</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls her with him as a hostage, holding a gun to her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
Then lower your weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[They remain at a standoff for a few moments.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He lowers his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(warning)<br />
Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Trust me on this one.</blockquote>
<p>[The team lowers their guns. They're forced to their knees, their hands cuffed behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
(yelling to crowd)<br />
So where is this hero? The one who'd surely stop us from emptying the town's coffers? Helping ourselves to its women? Burning it to the ground once we're done&#8230;? So tell me?! Where is he? Where is this great hero who'd keep us from destroying everything you hold dear?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(appearing suddenly)<br />
He's right here!</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers start to applaud, calling out praise and Lucius's name.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
For I am the man you seek.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
Kill him!</blockquote>
<p>[The ruffians strike at Lucius all at once with large sticks and knives. Nothing gets past the Ancient shield. Lucius then takes them one on one in hand combat with the force of the shield, defeating them easily. They start to run away.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Get out! Don't come back! For so long as I protect these people, this town shall be safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGERS<br />
Lucius! Lucius!</blockquote>
<p>[They run and embrace him. The team stares bemused.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Lucius sits at the table, drinking and telling more stories. The barmaid sits in his lap. Sheppard's team enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
So, I finish off the last Wraith guard. And I turn around and look at the queen and I say, "you know, if you were twenty pounds heavier, you'd look like my ex-wife."<br />
(everyone laughs)<br />
I said that because she was so fat.<br />
(notices the team)<br />
Hey! Colonel Sheppard! Hey come in, come in. Sit down. 
(to barmaid)<br />
Make way. Get&#8212;let-let 'em have a seat.</blockquote>
<p>[The women leave the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no. We have to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You sure? Because they're making some kind of a schnitzel in my honor tonight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, we gotta get back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Ah. Well I guess the only thing left to do is for you to thank me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
For saving your lives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(insincerely)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Please, it was nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, it <i>was</i> nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
What are you talking about "it was nothing." These people had you on your knees.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, they did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, you're welcome.</blockquote>
<p>[The team leaves. As they exit, Lucius calls out to them.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Be careful on the way back to the 'gate. Because, there's-there's talk of some angry raiders in the area!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE SQUARE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Just outside the tavern door, a furious Ronon turns to go back in. Sheppard holds him back.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No-no-no. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[The team walks away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You know what, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk. Take a look around. Make sure those ruffians are gone for good, all right? Don't you worry. I'll be back.</blockquote>
<p>[He kisses the barmaid and leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OUTSKIRTS OF VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Lucius walks out of the village and through some wild grasses, watching to ensure he isn't followed. He crosses a bridge, pausing a moment. He continues to stop at various points. After entering some woods, he reaches a building where all the ruffians are camped. One man, Fortnum, has his arm in a sling.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Nice job, everybody! Very convincing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
Little too convincing. Took out three of Lanko's teeth and broke Fortnum's wrist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Hey, I had to make it look good. Anyway, here's a little something that may make it worthwhile.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls out a small bag of coins and hands them to Amaris. Amaris counts them.]
</p>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
This isn't the amount we agreed on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, you guys didn't really seem to have your hearts in it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
We had a deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, maybe next time, you'll make more of an effort.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
How dare you speak down to us. We were elite soldiers in the Genii army, Cowan's personal guard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, you were. Now you're mercenaries. C'mon, as far as jobs for hire go, this wasn't so bad. You come in, you scare a few people, you take a few punches, then you leave. You get paid, nobody gets hurt. Well, except for Lanko&#8230;and of course Fortnum with his gimpy wrist. Sorry about that, buddy!</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
We may have been forced from our homes when Ladon Radim took power. We're still Genii. And one of these days, we'll march into the capital and retake what was ours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, well&#8230;good luck with that.</blockquote>
<p>[Lucius walks out of the clearing. Unbeknownst to him, the Atlantis team is hidden among the trees.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A boy keeps kicking Lucius at his urging. He laughs; it doesn't hurt.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh, come on. Kick me. Again. Yeah, yeah. There you go. Anybody else? Anybody else wanna take a crack at me? Huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team returns. Lucius spots them.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />

I'm just spitballing here. What if we hugged each other&#8230;and the device would-would, uh, you know, help us, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't like that idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
No, I know&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Bad idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I don't think that&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And it's not possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yeah, It doesn't work that way. Okay, okay. Here's one. What if I swung from a clock tower on a long rope, right into town.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I don't know. That's all I have. I could set myself on fire?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(rueful grin)<br />
Okay&#8230;um&#8230;I could run naked&#8230;oh, I know, I know! I have one! What if I got on your shoulders, and we have a cloak-like thing&#8230;some religious thing they could be afraid of giants?</blockquote>
<p><b>LATER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Okay&#8230;what if we build a tunnel? Okay, we could tunnel&#8230;? Or&#8230;a&#8230;boulder! Huge boulder. I'm camouflaged. I'm protected. Now the boulder protects you. Or, um&#8230;a magnifying glass&#8230;and some tape!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I have an idea, Lucius.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Some poisoned tape.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The villagers are all gathered in this room, watching the Genii through the window. Lucius sneaks in the back door.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Lucius!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
I knew you'd return to save us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I've returned. But&#8230;you people, you're gonna have to save yourselves.</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers mutter "what" and murmur in consternation.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
You do not wish to help us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
No-no-no. Of course I wanna help. It's just&#8230;look, what if I wasn't here? What would you do then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Wait for you to come back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
All right, there-there's the problem. What if I didn't know you were in trouble? Or&#8230;I couldn't get back in time? What would you do then? I mean, look, you're a great group of people. It's a lovely town. But, there's a lot of horrible people out there, so you gotta fend for yourselves. Starting today.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
I-I understand what Lucius is saying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
Well, by allowing him to assume the responsibility of protecting us, we're surrendering our independence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
That's right!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
Right. So, in exchange for the convenience of having someone safeguard our town, we're giving up the very part of ourselves we seek to protect!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Listen to her. She's smart!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
We need to regain our strength and our independence by taking responsibility for our lives, and the lives of our neighbors.</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers are all murmuring in agreement.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
(gaining confidence)<br />
After today, we will no longer be dependent on one man.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(nervously)<br />
Well okay, okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARMAID<br />
(intensely)<br />
There will be no champion protector. For it will fall to us to protect&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Okay, okay. Hold up-hold up. Wait-wait-wait. You're getting a little carried away here. Okay? Independence is a great thing, but so is the <i>comfort</i> of having somebody there to pick up the slack now and again, okay. You don't want to be doing it all the time, because, you know, you got jobs. Or, you-you have hobbies, right? Beardo here, he likes to fish. Right?<br />
(the bearded man nods in agreement)<br />
You don't want to be bothered by having to "rise up" and save the village every day. You know what I mean? But that's a thought for another day. Okay? For today, you're gonna have to fight for yourselves.<br />
(pats barmaid on shoulder)<br />
Okay, so remember what you said about strength, and integrity, and responsibility. So you get out there, and you fight for your town! Go to the alleys. Spread the word! Now go-get out! Get out! Okay, yes, rally, rally. Yes, good kid.</blockquote>
<p>[The rallied villagers scramble to prepare.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE SQUARE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AMARIS<br />
Maybe he changed his mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya glares at Amaris.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
You're out of time, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[He tosses the radio away.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Doctor McKay!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon steps in front of McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Me first.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla steps in front of Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'll do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Well, how positively moving. I almost wish I could shoot you all at once.</blockquote>
<p>[He raises his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Kolya!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard appears from the other side of the square. Kolya holsters his sidearm. All the other soldiers keep their weapons trained on Sheppard, except for those holding the rest of the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
I should've killed you when we first met, Colonel. It would've saved me a lot of trouble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The feeling's mutual.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Goodbye, Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[The soldiers start shooting. They expend several rounds from various guns, but all are repelled by the green Ancient force field. After they're done, Sheppard unzips his tactical vest, revealing the device.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, now that you've got that out of your system&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The shield shorts out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh crap.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Reload!</blockquote>
<p>[The soldiers begin reloading. Lucius walks into the square.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Don't bother!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You should've left town when you had the chance.</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers swarm out of all the buildings, carrying rifles, pitchforks, picks, and other makeshift weapons. They heavily outnumber the Genii.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
I'm sure you're thinking the same thing right about now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If I gave you the opportunity to surrender, I don't suppose you'd take it?</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't think so.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare each other down, then both draw their sidearms. Sheppard outdraws Kolya, shooting him dead.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to other Genii)<br />
Put down your weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[The Genii surrender.]
</p><p><b>LATER</b>
</p><p>[A large table has been set out, brightly decorated. The villagers are happy, setting up a celebration. Lucius walks with the Atlantis team.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
You sure you guys can't stay for some schnitzel? I mean, this is a party for you guys as much anybody, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You guys have a good time. We're overdue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Well, thanks for everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just remember, stay out of trouble, or we'll be back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Oh&#8230;uh, Colonel Sheppard? Aren't you forgetting something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(smiling)<br />
Oh, yeah. I did say I'd give that back to you, didn't I?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reaches into one of his vest pockets.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Yes you did.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard slaps the Ancient shield device onto Lucius's chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
(smiling)<br />
You're a good man. You're an honest man. And you made me a better man myself, you know that, don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. Bye, Lucius.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard seems to be fighting a smile. The rest of his team look bemused as they follow Sheppard out of the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I thought you said that personal shield was depleted?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then, it is worthless.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Pretty much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're not going to tell Lucius?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Hit me as hard as you can.</blockquote>
<p>[The child kicks Lucius in the shins. Lucius doubles over in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>LUCIUS<br />
Ow! Ow! Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He'll figure it out.</blockquote>
