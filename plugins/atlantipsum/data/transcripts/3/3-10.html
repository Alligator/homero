<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Excerpts from SGA 3.05 "Progeny" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>END EXCERPTS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> moves through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[McKay stands in front of video monitor with a notepad computer and conducts a briefing for <i>Deadalus</i> crew.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, I'm in Atlantis, and I need to get to Earth. What do I do? Since we no longer have access to a ZPM due to&#8230;unforeseeable circumstances, my only option would be to call the <i>Daedalus</i> and spend the next three weeks twiddling my thumbs waiting to get back home&#8230;until now.<br /><br />

I give you the McKay-Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge. Thirty-four gates from both the Milky Way and Pegasus gate systems have been strategically placed in the massive void between our two galaxies. Simply enter on either side&#8212;for example, Atlantis&#8212;and boom! A macro that, uh, I have written especially for the occasion will command each Gate in the chain to store you in its buffer and forward you along to the next and the next, and the next, and the next, and the next, until you arrive&#8230;here.</blockquote>
<p>[As McKay speaks, the video monitor gives a graphic depiction of the McKay/Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing)<br />
Once at the mid-way space station, you simply exit the Pegasus gate system, and enter the Milky Way gate system, where a similar macro, designed by yours truly, will forward you along to the SGC. Total travel time, a little over thirty minutes. Cue applause.</blockquote>
<p>[The crew applauds.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(signaling)<br />
Thank you. Enough.</blockquote>
<p>[The crew stops clapping.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The mid-way space station isn't completed yet, so we will be testing the system today using a puddle jumper. Now the&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell enters the bridge and interrupts McKay while striding to his command chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Okay. Show and tell's over. The test is about to begin. Let's get back to our stations, please.</blockquote>
<p>[The crew moves back to their bridge stations.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE, MID-WAY SPACE STATION</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> drops out of hyperspace near the partially constructed space station. It is a cylinder shaped truss device; each end of the cylinder brackets around a Stargate, one facing the Pegasus Galaxy, the other, the Milky Way Galaxy.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(reading his notepad computer)<br />
All systems seem to be&#8230;huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distractedly)<br />
Oh, there's an odd echo on the proximity sensors. It won't affect the test, but, uh&#8230;Yeah, we're-we're ready to go.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper lowers from the bay into the Gate room. The Stargate is already active.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
The gate is dialed. The forwarding macro's been uploaded.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir watches from the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into wireless)<br />
All right, John. You have a go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is alone in the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right then, here goes.</blockquote>
<p>[The puddle jumper disappears into the event horizon.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p>[There are intermittent flashes of orange light during the extended wormhole passage.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE, MID-WAY SPACE STATION</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's puddle jumper exits the active Pegasus Stargate and brakes to a stop within the cylinder. The <i>Daedalus</i> hovers overhead.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We have a contact!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(keying radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, right on time. What's your status?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
It felt a little weird, but everything seems to be in one piece.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Ready to proceed to next phase.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uploading macro and initiating dialing sequence.</blockquote>
<p>[He dials the Stargate, which activates.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Shall I tell him to stand down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. It's, uh, nothing to do with the, uh, the test. It's just our, uh, sensors are not working properly.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(slightly impatient)<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, ready to proceed.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Do I clear him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted)<br />
Mm. Mm. Yeah-yeah-yeah. I'm sure he's fine.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell continues to watch McKay at the offhand response. McKay looks up from his computer and notices Caldwell's stare.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(more focused)<br />
Uh, he's good to go. Good to go. Yes. Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell relaxes back into his chair and nods to the helmsman.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into comm)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, you have a go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard takes a deep breath and powers up the jumper's thrusters.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[McKay leans in to study the helmsman's monitors.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jumper is away.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay goes back to studying his computer.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Harriman is at his station. Landry stands behind him watching the Stargate. O'Neill, dressed in Class A uniform walks up and stands next to Landry.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
He's late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
When travelling almost three million light years, I'm not so sure there's such a thing as "late".</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Right. Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
You're just mad you didn't get to fly the maiden voyage yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, General, I am quite fond of both maidens and voyages. I mean, put the two together, and&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(interrupting)<br />
You're not a test pilot anymore, Jack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
That's what the President said.</blockquote>
<p>[Landry chuckles as the Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Incoming wormhole.</blockquote>
<p>[The puddle jumper flies through the active Stargate and brakes to a stop right in front of the control room window. Sheppard is clearly visible in the cockpit, eye to eye with the generals.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(leaning into microphone)<br />
It's about time!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sorry, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(into microphone)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, welcome to Earth.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Thank you, sir. Good to be back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(over radio)<br />
You know where to park.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(continuing)<br />
We'll debrief and go over the flight data as soon as you're ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[The puddle jumper hovers further upward into the silo, disappearing out of sight. Landry and O'Neill walk away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
Colonel, we're receiving a databurst. Jumper Three has arrived at Stargate Command.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Mission accomplished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(still studying his computer)<br />
Yes, of course it worked. I'm already onto the next problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Which is&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the, uh sensors are having a hard time determining what it is. Probably due to the Doppler effect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(pressing)<br />
What "what" is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm detecting a foreign object travelling at .999 the speed of light, and it's coming this way.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE, MID-WAY SPACE STATION</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's puddle jumper exits the Milky Way Galaxy Stargate and stops inside the space station. <i>Daedalus</i> still hovers nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
We have a contact, sir! It's Colonel Sheppard back from Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into comm)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, welcome back to the middle of nowhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Thank you, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(continuing into radio)<br />
I've got, uh, takeout pizza for everyone back in Atlantis&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
With your permission, I'd like to, uh, upload the macro and dial out before it gets cold.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Negative. We're putting that leg of the trip on hold for now. Seems like we're expecting company.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay paces around the room. Caldwell sits at the head of the table. Sheppard sits next to him. The rest of the room is filled with sitting and standing crew members.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Believe it or not, moving that fast, while an incredible feat of technology, isn't very useful. Certainly in comparison to travel through hyperspace. Now, moving as fast as it is, this ship&#8212;assuming it is a ship&#8212;would still take at least a million years just to reach the Milky Way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
That close to the speed of light, don't you have to take relativity into account?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly. The people on board&#8212;assuming that they are people&#8212;would only experience, maybe&#8230;twelve years? So a few stasis chambers, they're laughing&#8230;well, they're not laughing, they're unconscious, but you know, metaphorically&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, assuming it's a ship and assuming they're people&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What do we do about them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, well, we try and make contact, obviously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
How do you propose we do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pull up, honk the horn, try to get them to roll down their window.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'm talking about attempting to match their speed. This ship is not designed to do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well we can't. I mean even if we succeeded, we'd be subject to the same time dilation effects. We'd be out of contact with Earth and Atlantis for, what, years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can't we overtake them with our hyperdrive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, but they would blow right past us as soon as we dropped back into normal space, because our "sublight" engines aren't capable of accelerating to anywhere near the speed of light.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So uh, we max out the sublight engines. Get as close as we can get.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Yes. I mean, that-that might work. Um, we should at least be able to stay in range enough to get some sensor readings. Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Do it. I'll let Atlantis know you're going to be late.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell rises and leaves, signalling the dismissal of everyone. McKay stops Sheppard from exiting.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um, did you really get pizza for everyone? Because it would be a shame for that to go to waste if we're really gonna um&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(abashed)<br />
Yeah, okay, so solve this first, and then&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> moves at sublight speeds.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Crew man their stations, including Caldwell in the commander's chair. Sheppard and McKay hover near the port station.]
</p>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
Sir, we've got just about everything we're gonna get out of sublight engines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're gonna fly by us in three&#8230;two&#8230;one&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A ship, moving so fast it's practically a blur of light zooms by the much slower moving <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Interesting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If these readings are correct, and, to be perfectly fair they may not be&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's an Ancient warship. It's possibly <i>Aurora</i> class.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Who's flying it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I would imagine Ancients?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
There hasn't been any of them around for over ten thousand years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disgusted)<br />
Relativity! Look, remember, for them only handful of years have passed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't those ships have hyperdrives?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe their hyperdrive was damaged in the battle with the Wraith. It happens with us all the time. I mean, it, uh, it conked out on the way, and they were forced to continue at as close to light speed as possible. That would explain how they got a million light years away from Pegasus without having to leave a million years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You know their subspace drive specs better than I do, Doctor, but I'm not sure an <i>Aurora</i>-class ship has the power to do what you're suggesting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe they have a ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That would be worth finding out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, we need to send them a message before they get out of range, and we have to jump ahead. Something like, uh, you know, we are humans from Earth, currently occupying Atlantis, yadda yadda yadda.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why don't we just ask them to slow down.</blockquote>
<p>[A sensor on the starboard station beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>HELMSMAN<br />
Colonel Caldwell, the unidentified vessel is slowing down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(offhand)<br />
Maybe they heard me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(leaning in to read the monitors)<br />
No, they saw us. And they're not just slowing down. I mean, they're slamming on the brakes at something like twenty-seven Gs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So now what?</blockquote>
<p>[A hologram of a woman in Ancient clothing appears on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
(via hologram)<br />
Unknown vessel, I am Captain Helia of the Lantian warship <i>Tria</i>. Our ship has suffered damage. We've scanned your vessel and determined that it is capable of hyperspace travel. We've begun deceleration maneuvers. Will you render assistance in the form of hyperspace transport?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, yes! Yes, of course we will.</blockquote>
<p>[The Helia hologram flickers but does not respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think she can hear you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(to helmsman)<br />
Open a channel.</blockquote>
<p>[The helmsman nods and presses some controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into comm)<br />
This is Colonel Stephen Caldwell of the Earth ship <i>Daedalus</i>. It would be an honor to render assistance in any way we possibly can.</blockquote>
<p>[Helia smiles and nods in gratitude before the hologram disappears.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(ecstatic)<br />
We're gonna meet Ancients! I mean&#8230;flesh and-and blood Ancients who know what everything is and how everything works. I mean, I don't even know what to ask first!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard smiles at the thought.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, it's gonna be a couple hours before we can match velocities for transport.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(also looking excited)<br />
That should give you enough time to write out that list.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. Right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay races off.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir, Teyla, and Ronon walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They were battle scarred and already well on their way to Earth when their hyperdrive finally gave out on them. They decided it was best to continue forward than go back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How many survivors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Just over a hundred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(excited)<br />
Word has already begun to spread amongst my people. They believe this return was foretold; that it marks the turning in the tide in the war against the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I don't know about that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They have come to a stop in the Gate room. Chuck is on the balcony above.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Dr. Weir? The <i>Daedalus</i> is ready to beam down our people and the Ancient delegation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir nods and zippers her jacket.]
</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay, and five Ancients, including Helia, beam into the room near the Stargate. Weir and company and Sheppard and company start to walk towards each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dr. Weir, Ronon, Teyla, this is Helia, captain of the Ancient ship <i>Tria</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(bowing slightly)<br />
It's an honor to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
Thank you, and from what I'm told, you've done a remarkable job preserving our city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we did what we could with what we had.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
I need to speak to the leader of your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm in charge of the Atlantis expedition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
You misunderstand me, Dr. Weir. I need to talk to the one who can speak for <i>all</i> the people of Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That can certainly be arranged. But may I ask why?</blockquote>
<p>[A console suddenly rises up out of the floor, forcing Ronon to jump back out of the way. He raises his gun at the new device.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(flabbergasted)<br />
What is that? How come I've never seen that?</blockquote>
<p>[Helia puts her hand on the device, and Ancient systems power down all over Atlantis.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Excuse me, what's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
Thank you for all that you've done, Dr. Weir, but your guardianship of this city is no longer necessary. The city is now under my control.</blockquote>
<p>[The Atlantis expedition team exchange upset looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey and O'Neill sit at one side of the table; Helia paces at the other side.]
</p>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
We were in a battle with Wraith cruisers. They proved too much for us. So we started back to Atlantis, only to be told the final evacuation was already in progress. I decided to push on to Earth and join the evacuees. Even, when our hyperdrive failed, we decided to continue on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I can't begin to imagine what you and your crew must be going through right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
We owe you and your people a debt of gratitude, but we've just returned home. Home to a place we thought we'd never set eyes on again, and we need some time&#8230;alone.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey looks about to speak, but O'Neill jumps in.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
You do know that we've shed our own fair share of blood defending this city from the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HELIA<br />
But by your own admission, you are responsible for waking the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
&#8230;Right?</blockquote>
<p>[Floundering, O'Neill turns to Woolsey.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
And by your own admission, you are responsible for the emergence of the Wraith as a species. The fact is, if it weren't for our expedition, there would be no Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
No one's saying the city doesn't belong to you, or that you don't belong here. What we're saying is that&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey rolls his eyes and grabs O'Neill's arm to interrupt him.]
</p>

<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
From their point of view, Dr. McKay, they're being extremely generous. Keep in mind, that when they left Atlantis, we were basically a hunter-gatherer species.</blockquote>

Well, did you remind them if we hadn't hunted and gathered them out of the void between galaxies, they would still be stuck there?!</blockquote>

We should've left them out there.</blockquote>

I can't. But the IOA wants Woolsey.</blockquote>

Woolsey?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yeah. To paraphrase the Ancients, they think you won't be able to&#8230;let go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So they're going to just shut us out after everything we've done here?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />

<p>[Behind him, Woolsey fires a pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
They're coming!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Gah!</blockquote>
<p>[The transmission abruptly terminates. Everyone stares in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
They never made it to the 'gate. I was informed they had a law written into their base code that made it impossible for them to harm the Ancients. How the hell did this happen?</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is&#8230;remotely possible that in trying to rewrite Niam's base code, I&#8212;we may have opened the door for them to make other changes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
You did this?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
At the time, we thought it was the only possible way to save the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How it happened doesn't matter. They may have changed it on their own. The question is, how do we fix it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
That's why I called you in. I have my orders. The <i>Daedalus</i> is already on its way. Now what I need from you is&#8230;what's the best way to get a nuke past the shield?</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls up a schematic of Atlantis on the monitor screen. Everyone looks at each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, I have no idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
I didn't call you in, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're going to use nuclear weapons on Atlantis?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
It's the gateway to Earth!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And we have an iris.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Yes, we do. But thanks to your intergalactic gate bridge, all they have to do is rewrite your macro, and they can come out anywhere in the Milky Way!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but those macros are very complicated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
<i>They</i> are very complicated, Doctor McKay. They just rewrote their own damn base code! I think they can handle it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sir, General O'Neill and Woolsey may still be alive. Now, I know the city like the back of my hand. Just give me sixty marines and-and some of Colonel Carter's new, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Anti-replicator weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, those things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(resolute)<br />
I'm sorry, Colonel. I have standing orders. They happen to be General O'Neill's standing orders. The <i>Daedalus</i> will be there in a little under four days. Now how do I get a nuke past their shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir, Beckett, McKay and Sheppard are all in the office.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Now, those replicator thingamajigies you're talking about&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's just call them ARGs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're energy weapons. They disrupt the link between the nanite cells. The Replicators literally fall apart when you fire on them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, uh, hypothetically, Teyla and Ronon would be more than willing to help&#8230;if we asked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We would need to gate into Atlantis. All they need to do to keep us out is activate the 'gate shield.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I did write a backdoor to the shield program. Couple years ago when Kolya stormed the city? So, I mean, it could "hypothetically" let us get into the Gate Room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
General Landry was worried about the Replicators rewriting the bridge macro to 'gate them somewhere else in the Milky Way. Does that mean you could change the macro? Take us somewhere else in Pegasus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Somewhere like, uh&#8230;just talking here, uh,&#8230;the Athosian settlement where Teyla and Ronon are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(inspired)<br />
We'd need a jumper!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(snapping his fingers)<br />
And, uh, some of those ARGs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And&#8230;someone to make sure Landry doesn't close the iris on us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hypothetically.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC LEVEL 19 CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Weir walk down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The jumper is in its storage area under guard. We need for one of us to be added to the authorized personnel list, and there's only one guy who can do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(confused)<br />
No. Why'd you think I was going to say me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't know. It seemed like you were leading up to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, sadly, Dr. Lee's been the one heading up the jumper research project because they refuse to send it to Area 51 for me. But, um, I think I should be able to able to add one of our key cards to the authorized personnel list, but, um, I have to do that from his office.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, he's in his office. So you need to distract him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Me? How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, here's what I'm thinking&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LEE'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Weir stands by Lee. McKay stands further back by Lee's computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(excited)<br />
I got to say, I have never met a woman this into <i>World of Warcraft</i>. I&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They look back at McKay, who smiles. Weir grins with false brightness.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's a silent passion of mine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(nodding sagely)<br />
As it is with all of us. I'm uh, Level 75, mage, specializing in engineering and jewelling. You?</blockquote>
<p>[While Lee and Weir speak, McKay turns to the computer and starts to type, shifting the screen so Lee can't see it.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh, wow, Level 75. Me, I'm only&#8230;fifty.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir moves so Lee is completely back to McKay. Weir watches McKay. He whirls his hand to give him more time.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Ah, well, I had the beta of the expansion pack, so I sorta had a leg up on most people. What's your race?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir glances at McKay. He gives a signal for her to stretch out the conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Mage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
You know I-I'm trying to increase my enchanter skills, but, uh&#8230;I don't know. It's just not going very well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh, I disagree, Bill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir shrugs flirtatiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh! Uh, Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He begins to turn around. McKay looks up, panicked. Weir reaches out to keep Lee facing her, brushing down his lab coat.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I-I don't mean&#8230;I'm sorry. I don't mean to be so&#8230;forward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
No, no, no. Be forward. I'm&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They both chuckle nervously. McKay gets back to typing, replacing Nirman, Wallace with his own name.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, oh, I, look, I&#8230;I'm&#8230;not quite sure how exactly I should put this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
A true mage speaks his mind, or, her mind, in your case.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sets the computer screen back where it was.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(loudly)<br />
Wow! Will you look at the time. Where does it go, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Lee turns around blankly. Weir slouches in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, we're late, we should&#8230;um, book. We'll see you, Bill!</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries out. Weir follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Bye, Bill!</blockquote>
<p>[A confused Lee watches them leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The Atlantis group is all geared up and heading down the corridor. They suddenly meet up with Wallace, who's moving slowly on crutches.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wallace. What are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
General Landry wanted to talk to me about reassignment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(wincing)<br />
Oh, right. Sorry about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Are you already going on missions without me, or&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett lays a comforting hand on Wallace's shoulder. Sheppard moves past to check the corridor behind them is empty.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You should really stay off of that ankle, son.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Yeah, well when General Landry says now, it's now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry about this, too.</blockquote>
<p>[He primes a zat and fires it at Wallace. He helps lower the stunned Wallace gently to the floor. Beckett takes the crutches away. They drag him into the armory.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can't afford to have him tell Landry he ran into us.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER STORAGE AREA</b>
</p><p>[The team approach and hide on the side. Sheppard looks in the front window, seeing only Siler working on the cargo bay. He heads towards the back of the jumper, readying his zat. He shoots Siler, knocking him unconscious.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's move!</blockquote>
<p>[He heads to the cockpit. The others join him, Beckett and Weir dragging Siler outside. McKay uses a computer outside to interface with the SGC dialing computer, dialing the intergalactic bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You set?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go for it!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay joins the others inside the jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate begins to spin and dial an outgoing wormhole. Harriman looks at his instruments in puzzlement.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
What the hell?<br />
(into intercom)<br />
General Landry to the control room immediately!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, they're going to be able to get through my hack pretty quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's all right. I don't need much time.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Landry arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
I don't know, sir. The 'gate just started dialing on its own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
It doesn't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
(annoyed)<br />
I know that, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[The jumper lowers into the Gate Room.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Close the iris!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
I can't, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Find a way, Walter.<br />
(into microphone)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, stand down! That is a direct order.</blockquote>
<p>[The jumper flies through the active wormhole, and the Stargate shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Do you want me to&#8230;try to find out where they're going, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Don't bother. I already know.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper sits inside the partially constructed station between the two galaxies.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[They wait while Rodney works on the macro on his computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
My turtles!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I just bought some wee baby turtles, and no one knows to feed them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, turtles are pretty hardy. I'm sure they'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And they make good soup.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett looks nonplussed at Sheppard's statement.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, I figure I'm back for good, so I might as well get a pet. And, I'm allergic to cats, and uh&#8230;well, I'm at work too long to be fair to a dog, so I went with turtles. I probably killed them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Anytime now, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh trust me, I am going as fast as I can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Poor little buggers.</blockquote>
<p>[The HUD comes to life. Sheppard studies it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Milky Way 'gate just activated. Did you do that?</blockquote>
<p>[Landry appears on the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(over transmission)<br />
Colonel Sheppard. I'm going to assume that you're still at the midway station waiting for Doctor McKay to rewrite his macro. I understand what you're doing, Colonel. Hell, I'll even call it brave, but if you don't turn that ship around immediately and come back to the SGC, I'll see to it personally that your career in the military is&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, who's looked uncomfortable all the while. Reaches out and shuts down the transmission. Everyone looks at him. He shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That way I won't know what he was gonna say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay! Okay, I've got it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, last chance to change our minds.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks back at Sheppard with determined expressions.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's do it.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p>[There are intermittent flashes of orange light during the extended wormhole passage.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATHOSIAN TENT</b>
</p><p>[Ladon sits across a table from Teyla and Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I knew you would never come to me, so I thought I would come to you. Our relationship has been&#8230;strained. But we need to put all that behind us, now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Well, your friends have all returned home, and you've been asked to leave Atlantis. So the question is, what will you do next?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are helping my people rebuild this settlement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Yes, but the settlement seems finished. Besides, is carpentry and clearing brush really the best use of your skills.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Get to the point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Come work with me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon scoffs.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I understand your reluctance. In the past, the Genii have hardly been the shining beacon of hope in the galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
In the past?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
We are growing stronger every day. And we have a number of operations planned that could seriously cripple the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What do you have in mind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Well, I am of course reluctant to go into specific details here. But suffice it to say, the plans are dangerous, and in need of your unique abilities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're not interested.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Well, that's too bad, although not entirely surprising. Give it some time, Ronon. I wonder how much joy you'll find as a tava-bean farmer.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOSIAN CAMP, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon leave the tent and stand over a campfire. A pot of stew hangs cooking over it.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm not gonna start working for the Genii!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We would not be working for them, merely&#8230;with them.</blockquote>
<p>[She doesn't look convinced herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Forget it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Since Atlantis was returned to the Ancestors, the Genii are the most powerful and organized group of humans fighting the Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon studies her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
The Ancestors will do something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
True. But they neither need, nor have they requested our help. The Genii have.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon grimaces.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know that you are anxious to return to the fight, but&#8230;my people are farmers!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe this isn't the place for me then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That smells great!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ronon spin around. They see Sheppard, McKay, Weir and Beckett entering the camp, smiling at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hope you saved some for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(elated)<br />
John?! It is wonderful to see you&#8212;all of you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard points to the pot.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We missed that&#8230;whatever that is.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon has gotten over his surprise and studies the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Something's wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla turns back, studying the others, concerned.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TENT</b>
</p><p>[Everyone is standing around inside the tent. McKay distributes ARGs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They emit a directional energy beam that disrupts the connection between nanites.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not what I asked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Er, yes. They work good.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon practices aiming his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Good. So you need us because, uh, we know our way around the city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I need you because you're part of our team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There may be hundreds of Replicators on Atlantis by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've got a plan. A good one. I wouldn't ask you to come with us if I didn't think we could do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Also, General O'Neill and Richard Woolsey were both on Atlantis when the Replicators attacked. There is a chance they're still alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll be damned if I'm going to let a bunch of Replicators take our home away from us. So&#8230;you with us?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Teyla exchange looks then smile at Sheppard. Sheppard nods and smiles.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEW ATHOS STARGATE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper hovers by the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Beckett, Teyla, Ronon, Weir and Sheppard are all inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I think I've loaded up the GDO. It'll lower the shield when we dial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go for it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. Dialing Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p>[Her nervously presses the dialing buttons.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate activates.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE AND CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate kawhooshes. The Asuran Replicators are startled. Several go down to man the Gate Room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TALUS<br />
What's happening? Activate the shield.</blockquote>
<p>[Cetus works some controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>CETUS<br />
I can't.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's confirmation. Gate shield has been lowered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hope this little plan of ours works.</blockquote>

Yeah, you and me both.</blockquote>
