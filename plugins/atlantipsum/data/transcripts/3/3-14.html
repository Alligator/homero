<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[A team of scientists, led by McKay and Zelenka, explore a darkened corridor of the base. Water logged furniture and debris are scattered haphazardly through the area.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She used to leave the lights on, all over the house. Every room. Drove my father nuts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(chuckling)<br />
For me, it was my brother. Only we had no lights. He used to leave candles burning everywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you know what? No one wants to hear any more stories about how poor you were as a child, all right? We already feel as sorry for you as is humanly possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(aside, to Esposito)<br />
Uh, he burned the house down, you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My sister was afraid of the dark. Aw, and used to blame me for leaving the lights on. Of course, my father believed her. He never sided with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We had to live in a tent&#8230;in the dead of winter for three months.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
You know, at least my stories relate to what we're doing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, so do mine!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're trekking all over the city, shutting down everything the Ancients activated while they were oh so briefly in control, so we can stop the power from draining from our one precious ZPM. How does that relate to your idiot brother burning the house down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay, if we don't succeed&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're not going to have to live in a tent in the dead of winter!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's a metaphor.</blockquote>
<p>[Doctor Esposito runs her scanner over one of the closed doors.]
</p>
<blockquote>ESPOSITO<br />
Doctor McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm? Thank god.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Zelenka rush over to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>ESPOSITO<br />
The control panel&#8230;it's completely shot.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay brushes close to her as he forces himself past to the control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really? You think so? You know, I don't get these Ancients. They're supposed to be so smart? Then why activate something that you don't need and you're not using, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[He smiles at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Well, maybe they didn't have time to get to it, you know, before the human form Replicators that you reprogrammed attacked.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka smiles flirtatiously at Esposito.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(piqued)<br />
Yes, yes. We all know what happened.</blockquote>
<p>[His expression softens as he nods to Esposito again, who ducks her head.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay gets the door open.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah! Voila.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads the way into the darkened room.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You're just angry that you couldn't figure out how to override the Ancient protocols that kept us from shutting this place down remotely from the control room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
Hey, neither could you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but I didn't bet everyone a month's pay that I could do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pointing at Zelenka)<br />
You&#8212;<br />
(to others)<br />
Okay, you know what? Look around, see if you can figure out how to turn this place off&#8230;whatever it is.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay approaches a lighted panel on a one step podium and starts to hook up his laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(nervous)<br />
Wait, are-are you sure you should be going up there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How else am I going to find out what this place does, huh?<br />
(muttering)<br />
God forbid there should be anything in the Ancient database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, there probably is, we just don't have the time to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, here we go.</blockquote>
<p>[The machine powers up and shows a display.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Ah. Okay, there should be a main power switch&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to point to something on the control panel, but McKay brushes him off.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatient)<br />
Yes, I know that! What do you think I'm doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka pulls his outstretched arm back and runs it down his head, stepping further back. He fidgets, then gives a scheming grin.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right, double or nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Oh, you're on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. It's gonna be around here somewhere.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts studying the panel. Suddenly a panel overhead lights up, shining down on McKay. He looks up as a startled Zelenka and others step back. While they watch a thin beam of light comes down from the overhead panel and entwines itself around McKay. The system overloads and short circuits, sending electrical arcs around the room. Everyone ducks. Finally the machine shuts down, leaving the room in darkness again. Zelenka cautiously approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(worried)<br />
Rodney? What happened?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns to face Zelenka, eyes wide with shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not sure, but I think I just lost. Big time.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay sits on an infirmary bed. Sheppard and Weir stand nearby as Beckett approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
As far as I can tell, he's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was hit by a mysterious energy pulse. How can that possibly be fine?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've run every test I can. Bloodwork, MRIs, X-rays, the lot. I found no anomalies in any of the results.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, one more time&#8212;mysterious energy pulse! From a device created by the Ancients?! I mean, who knows what kind of long-term effects I could be in for. I mean, there's gross mutation, giantism, invisibility&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That would be cool. I turned into a bug.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stares at Sheppard, unable to believe his friends' blase reactions.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, like I said, as far as I can tell, he's as healthy as a horse. I'm clearing you for active duty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you insane?! Look, I need to be put under guard. Who knows what I could become!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What are the chances it could make him more pleasant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll keep an eye on him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(amused)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
Can you still see me?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and McKay work in the lab where McKay was struck by the beam. Sheppard sits nearby, reading a magazine. Everything is powered down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(exasperated sigh)<br />
What are you saying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, that you were showing off. Heh, heh. Normally if Doctor Esposito weren't around, I doubt you would've been as reckless as you were.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you insane?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which one's Esposito?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, the-uh, the long dark hair?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, right. The one with the perfect little&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Do you mind? We're trying to work here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For the record, I was going to say "smile."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dubious)<br />
Yeah, sure you were.<br />
(to Zelenka)<br />
What have you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Nothing. Whatever you did fried all the power conduits leading into the room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whatever I did?! Look, up until very recently, this lab was entirely underwater, quite possibly for over ten thousand years. How is that my fault?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(grudgingly)<br />
Well, that part of it isn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, that's it. I'm going for lunch.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[McKay sits alone at a table, eating a sandwich and a variety of fruit. He can hear his team's voices behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How is he doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Same ol' Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Are you sure? He looks a couple pounds heavier to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(scolding)<br />
Ronon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(innocently)<br />
What? He eats all the time. It's not like he exercises.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stops chewing and looks down at his tray self-consciously.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Feeding his unhappiness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello, I'm right here. I can&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He turns around to see the rest of his team are sitting at a table at the far side of the crowded room. They were too far away to hear his response, but glance over when they see him looking at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(softly, lost in thought)<br />
I can hear you. Huh.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks pensive and gets up to join the others. He blindly reaches back for his tablet computer as he moves, and thus does not see it slide across the table telekinetically into his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(agitated)<br />
For your information, I am exactly the same weight I've been since I got here. I need to eat regularly, otherwise I become hypoglycemic. And I am generally a very happy person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, please have your team report to the control room immediately. Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[The team quell their respective amused and bemused expressions to respond to the summons.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team join Weir in the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We received this transmission six minutes ago from Major Lorne's team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Atlantis base, repeat, we are under attack and cut off from the 'gate. I counted at least twenty, maybe more. Request backup immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where are they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(checking)<br />
M72-656.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have a team of marines meet us in the jumper bay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's jumper lowers into the Gate Room. From the balcony, Weir watches it leave.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka still works on the panel. Weir enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Doctor Weir? Any word?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Not yet. It has only been an hour. You wanted to see me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. I could use your help. Um, er, I managed to get power to part of the console to access the lab's research logs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, that's good news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, I'm not so sure. Uh, I could use a second opinion.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls up a display showing a lot of Ancient writing. Weir stands next to him at the console to take a closer look.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It seems much of this refers to different elements of&#8230;human physiology.</blockquote>
<p>[She punches a few keys and another display comes up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(concerned)<br />
It mentions the mutation of base genetic coding?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I realize that Doctor Beckett said that there were no "evident" effects from Rodney's exposure to the device, but&#8230;it seems&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's meant to manipulate human DNA.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Doctor Weir to the jumper bay. The rescue team has returned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Let's go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Zelenka arrive just as Sheppard's jumper door opens.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What else could it be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Oh, you're losing your mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm telling you it's a bit of a coincidence!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well then, prove it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(worried)<br />
Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Everyone's present and accounted for.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and a medical team arrive with gurneys.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How bad is it, and who's been hit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
No one, Doc. We're all fine. Thanks to&#8230;McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So he says.</blockquote>
<p>[Both Lorne and Sheppard look skeptical.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. I wasn't even sure it was me, at first. But, uh, the correlation's impossible to ignore. I saw Lorne's team pinned down, the bad guys closing in, I just thought, uh, wouldn't it be great if all of their weapons jammed&#8230;at the same time.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla studies McKay closely, shaking her head. Sheppard looks amused and openly doubtful.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, next thing I know, they're all running away, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So you think because you wanted it to happen, it just did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It was a little more than that.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir looks skeptical as well. McKay fidgets, frustrated.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you know what? Watch this! I'll uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks around, finally pointing at Beckett, who is lifted off the floor and hangs suspended in mid-air. Everyone watches in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Uh, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(worried)<br />
Rodney&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Believe me, I find this as disturbing as you do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(frightened)<br />
Like bloody hell you do!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Put him down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay lowers his hand, and Beckett slowly drifts to the floor, sighing in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, god.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay lies in an infirmary bed. Sheppard and Weir stand at his bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Have there been any other instances of this&#8230;power manifesting itself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Powers. Plural.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What else can you do besides telekinesis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(speaking quickly)<br />
Well, super-hearing for one, and I'm not sure, but I may actually be getting smarter. It's hard to say for sure, because I was-I was pretty smart to start with, but, um, recently I've been having some ideas that I don't think even I would've thought of before.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at them with excitement.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(drily)<br />
Does superego count as a power?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay spots a staff member bringing him a tray of food.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, finally! Look, keep it coming.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes the tray from her and digs into steak, potatoes and Jell-O.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He could also be dealing with a "super" appetite. Although, it's hard to tell, because he ate so much before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, very funny.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
My god, he's eating again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mouth full)<br />
I have a very active metabolism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, among other things. The scans show a dramatic increase in synaptic interaction throughout all the sections of Rodney's brain, much higher than normal human levels.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pauses in his eating, looking momentarily concerned. He takes his next bite more slowly.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There was an incident at SGC just over a year ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I recall that file&#8212;studied the data. Fascinating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
SG-1 discovered a highly evolved human being in stasis. Turned out, he was the result of experimentation by a Goa'uld named Anubis. He was trying to create a means of artificially accelerating the human physiology to the point of ascension.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that device I found must have been some kind of an accelerator. We know that the Ancients developed all kinds of powers as they evolved. It was just a matter of bad luck that we didn't run into that lab earlier. Seriously, me a superhero. Who would've thought it?</blockquote>
<p>[Pleased, he eats his meal with gusto. The others don't look as sanguine.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[A team works on studying the device. Among them are Weir, translating the logs, and Sheppard, who stands nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, we all agree the Ancients were pretty screwed up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All the ones I met were arrogant and condescending, and not for good reason. They made giant mistakes and never fixed them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They were still human.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then there were all those crazy rules.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Those only came after they ascended.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whatever. I&#8212;maybe this thing doesn't work on everyone, who knows? But we do know it works on McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(admonishing)<br />
It has only been a day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Assuming it's safe. Well, to be honest, even if it's not. If we can get a significant advantage over the Wraith and Replicators&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
John, I agree. This device may have great potential&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And with great potential comes great responsibility. I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Like a lot of other things we have found in this city, it is a very advanced piece of technology. For all we know, it could also be very dangerous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm just saying&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(exasperated)<br />
Yes, you can be next.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(brightening)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. Zelenka is nearby and has overheard the conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You know, if you're compiling a list&#8230;I-I'd&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Could we stay focused, please?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay hangs around the infirmary. Guards are at the entrance.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on, you can't keep me cooped up in here forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You might not be sick, Rodney, but I think we can both agree what's happening here is far from normal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly, so let me go out and start using my powers to do some good. Ooh, are you, uh, going to finish&#8230;that?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay points his hand at a donut on Beckett's desk. It starts to float in mid-air and slowly move towards McKay before Beckett notices and snatches it.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(angry)<br />
I'm serious! We have no idea of the extent of your genetic mutation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smugly)<br />
Please, mutation has such negative connotations. Advancement is more like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Until we know exactly what's going on here&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson, I'm still me. Anyway, it's not like you or, uh, these guys could stop me from leaving anyways.</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures to the guards at the door, who look on warily.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, but I could.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon arrives with quick strides from the other side of the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with bravado)<br />
Oh, you care to put that to a test?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(grinning)<br />
Do you?</blockquote>
<p>[They stand toe-to-toe. McKay deflates.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;no. Not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Anyways, as I was saying, I think you're fine to go about your daily duties, as long as you have someone with you. And you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Check in every couple of hours. Yes, yes. Ba-bye!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts walking out with a casual slide. He twists his wrist to the side as he passes Beckett's desk and the donut flies into his hand. McKay takes a bite as Beckett splutters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mouth full)<br />
You know, we could be a team. You could be my sidekick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sidekick?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, it'll be like Batman and Ronon. Has a nice ring to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />

What's wrong now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I just realized why light behaves as both particles and waves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, if you don't try to do this&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tosses off the headband and gets up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(interrupting)<br />
I know! I don't have much time left.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves.]

</p><p>[McKay simultaneously types on two different laptops. Weir enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Just a second.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds up a finger as he grabs his tablet computer and walks over to three other computers, where he proceeds to type some more, this time without using his fingers, but instead, telekinetically. Fruit cups, bar wrappers, and other debris are scattered across all the work tables.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There are, like, fifty simulations I'd like to be running right now, but the computers can't keep up with me. The irony being that I've actually figured out how to make them run ten times faster, but I haven't had time to actually stop and do it. Oh, I've, uh, uploaded the, uh, virtual prototype for a hyperspace generator for the puddle jumpers into the database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, that sounds great&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay nods, then starts back to work.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(hesitantly)<br />
Are you sure that&#8230;this is how you want to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Spend my last couple of days alive? Don't have much choice, do I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, I think it's very decent and noble of you to want to leave a scientific contribution behind. But I still believe there's a chance you can ascend if you put your mind to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We both know that that is a waste of time. Maybe you could do it, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(interrupting)<br />
I don't know if I could, but you are certainly selling yourself short by not even trying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
To be honest, I don't have the first clue where to start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Stop thinking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See, now, I don't understand that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
One of the biggest thing that holds people back is&#8230;that somewhere deep down&#8230;they believe they're not deserving. You have to&#8230;"release your burden."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Oh, please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know, spirituality to you is a load of mumbo-jumbo, but it does help people find peace with themselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But you have to believe&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm not talking about religion! I'm talking about shedding yourself of guilt, of anger, of ill-feeling, of anything that makes you feel shame. And then you can focus <i>all</i> of your energy on ascending.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So what you're telling me is that <i>I</i> don't think I'm worthy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Rodney, I don't know what you truly believe about yourself. For all I know, you&#8230;use your intelligence to compensate, to make yourself feel better, for&#8230;other things you think you may lack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That I can't tell you&#8230;but maybe you could start reading your own mind?</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves him to think about things.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka resets a control, and the panel lights up. Pleased, Zelenka moves over to his computer to study the input, looking perplexed at the results. McKay enters, and Zelenka immediately spots him. McKay has dark circles under his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Rodney, I don't care what you're going to say, I'm going to keep working on this, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quietly)<br />
Ah, well&#8230;I appreciate that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I mean, you saved my life, so&#8230;the least I can do is try to save yours, you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Radek&#8230;I think it's safe to say that, uh, I am at times a, uh, petty, vindictive, even a&#8230;jealous man. I supplement my own&#8230;anxieties or feelings of inadequacy by creating a&#8230;bubble of hostility around myself. I know you, probably more than anyone else, have had to bear the brunt of that hostility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
Rodney, you-you don't have to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, I do. Here's the thing&#8230;you're a brilliant scientist, and a-and a decent human being. And you should not have had to endure the kind of&#8230;abuse that you've taken from me in the past few years. I hope you can find a way to forgive me for all the things I've said and done to you. You deserve&#8230;much better than that. So-so I wanted you to know that.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka stares at him in shock, mouth agape.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits on her bed, looking at her tablet computer. The door chimes. Teyla goes to answer it. McKay stands outside with an elaborate tea set on a tray.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Mind if I come in?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay barges in without waiting for a response.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Sh-shouldn't you be&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(talking over her)<br />
Hope you don't mind.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks to the far end of the room, Teyla following. The door closes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was talking with Halling, and he happened to mention that it was the anniversary of the death of your father next week.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(bewildered)<br />
He did?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I might have asked a few, uh, pointed questions. But, um, I just thought it would be nice if&#8230;uh&#8230;What I mean is&#8230;I would be honored if you let me share the memorial tea ceremony with you. I don't know if it's wrong to do it early or anything, but, um, I may not be around next week. Anyway, I understand it's something you're not supposed to do alone.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles, clearly touched by the gesture.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[She reaches out to take the tray. McKay shifts it out of her reach.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No-no-no-no-no. I know exactly what to do. You are the one who's lost a loved one. I will serve you.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla is overwhelmed.]

</p><p>[Ronon walks down a corridor. McKay jogs to catch up to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(out of breath)<br />
Hey, buddy! Pal! I've been looking all over for you! Checked the, uh, gym, the mess&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I wasn't there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you're weren't. It's usually one of those is a&#8230;good bet. So, where you off to? Shooting range? A little, uh, target practice?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't need practice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no. No, no, no. Of course you don't.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay jogs to step in front of Ronon, making him halt.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I don't know how much time I have left, so I'm just going to&#8230;cut to the chase here. Ask you a rather, uh, personal question. Hopefully, you won't just hit me in the face.</blockquote>
<p>[He chuckles half-heartedly. Ronon's eyebrows raise expectantly and he smiles, looking like punching McKay in the face is an intriguing idea.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Asking away. Those&#8230;scars on your back, from&#8230;your encounters with the Wraith? You know, with the, uh,&#8230;tracking device, that&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are those like a&#8230;a badge of honor&#8230;for you? Or are they just a&#8230;constant reminder of something you'd rather forget?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks disturbed at the subject, but not angry.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, I know it's none of my business. I just&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sad)<br />
I try not to let things I can't change bother me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
That's very healthy.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shrugs. McKay looks around, seeing they're alone. He wraps his arms around the surprised Ronon in a bear hug. Uncomfortable, Ronon winces, slapping McKay on the back in a half-comforting, half-get-off-me manner. After several seconds, McKay releases him and steps back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hope you don't mind. I just healed them.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks away. A nonplussed Ronon reaches back to feel for the now non-existent scars.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters Weir's office. She is standing at a computer station, working.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're not still trying to find a way out of this for me, are you?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir spins around.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You think I'm going to give up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Look, all the Ancients that experimented with that device&#8212;they either ascended or died, most of them the latter, which is why it did not get put into common use.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Like you said, there were exceptions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah. Yes. Well&#8230;this will all be over soon, and you can get back to some real work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(upset)<br />
Rodney&#8230;don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. I'm not&#8230;I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just, uh&#8230;Hey, I just wanted to give you that.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands her a flash drive.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(amused)<br />
What have you invented now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, nothing. That's a-that's a book.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
About what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You. Well, you've taken a lot of crap as the, uh, leader of this expedition, and I just thought someone should, uh, leave a record of all the good things you've done. Everything you've done&#8230;right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Huh. Everything I do is on "record" for review.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes to sit at her desk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, yes, I know. I know. I just -I just thought that, um, I would have, uh, somewhat of a&#8230;unique perspective that other people might benefit from. You know, I, uh, actually took the liberty of, uh, doing some research into your past and, uh, included that as well. I'm sorry if I'm not a very good writer. It, uh, might be a bit, uh, overly maudlin in places?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir shifts, embarrassed, while McKay discusses his research, but plugs the drive into her computer and pulls up the file. She stares at it in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, this is five hundred pages long! When did you&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Anyway, that's all. Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Self-consciously, McKay leaves the office. Weir stares after him.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[McKay is again lying on the floor, lit candles around him. The device is attached to his head. Sheppard sits cross-legged against his bed, watching the laptop monitor. It beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's it down to?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's not important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Look, of course it is. It's got to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He rolls over to look for himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, seventeen hertz?! That's not even close!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's closer than you've ever been!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls off the headband.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, forget it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, if you have to keep asking, you're obviously not getting it. This is about letting go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know how to do that, okay? I'm me! I don't know how not to be me! Look, thank you for all of your help. I think, in the-in the grand scheme of things, we're-we're good, aren't we?</blockquote>
<p>[A range of emotions pass over Sheppard's face.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quietly)<br />
Good. Well, then, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like you to read my eulogy.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits up on his bed, angry.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I refuse to discuss that!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just keep it simple. Um, make up a few&#8230;nice things, er&#8230;I'd like my little sister to be there. And, um, oh! You should know that I told Beckett that he should most definitely do a full autopsy. He can use my body for any kind of, uh, experimentation, that might prove helpful, and, uh, oh, then I'd like to be cremated. I'd like my-my ashes to be, uh, thrown out into space from the jumper. So, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

<p>[McKay doubles over in pain, clutching his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Gah!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<p>[As McKay collapses, Sheppard catches him enough to let him fall onto the bed. McKay grunts in pain once more, then passes out. Sheppard checks his pulse.]

Medical team to my quarters.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>

</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The synaptic activity in your brain has reached over ninety percent. I don't know why, but it seems the more pervasive evolved state of the cortex is causing lapses in the lower brain function. It's almost as if your body's losing its natural ability to keep itself alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
When ascension occurs naturally, the physical body's no longer necessary in the final stages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, I don't know how much more you can take.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
About six percent?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There must be something we can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
It's okay. You know, I'm actually feeling a sense of&#8230;peace&#8230;interspersed with moments of sheer terror, of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, uh, as far as this ascension thing&#8230;I know you didn't have much success, but at this point&#8230;what do you got to lose?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
May as well go out fighting, eh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Absolutely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hook me up.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett nods and readies the device.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson&#8230;thank you. Thank you for everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(sadly)<br />
I only wish I could've done more, my friend.</blockquote>
<p>[They hook McKay up to the monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voice growing even weaker)<br />
Clear blue skies. All my troubles&#8230;just drifting away. Okay, stop talking now.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard has tears in his eyes as he watches.]

(tears in her eyes)<br />
Rodney, you're a good person. Know that we love you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rallying slightly)<br />
You love me? Really? All of you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In the way a friend&#8230;feels about another friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weaker)<br />
You're just saying that because I'm going to die. Oh god. I can't believe I'm going to die!</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Sheppard exchange worried looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quickly)<br />
All right, just back to the blue skies. Let your thoughts to. Concentrate on your breathing.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett watches as the monitor drops from three hertz, to two hertz, to one&#8230;]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh my god.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay suddenly reaches out and grabs Beckett by the lapels, staring at him intently. Beckett stares back, mouth agape. The monitors go wild before completely flatlining as McKay collapses.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's not breathing! Quick! Bag him! We need to get him on a ventilator!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />

<p>[Ronon lays McKay down on the podium.]

Okay, stand back!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard back away. The machine activates, the beam of light entwining around him again. It shuts down, and McKay immediately awakens.]

Yeah! I-I'm alive! I feel great! I feel, uh, um&#8230;hungry?</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone breaks out into relieved smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(smugly)<br />
And you're said it was impossible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The answer just&#8230;came to me. I was-I was-I was floating in this big black emptiness, and then-and then the answer came out of nowhere! Look, the device was designed to manipulate your DNA. It couldn't "reverse" the evolutionary advancement process because everyone's DNA is different. It makes certain changes that causes the DNA to evolve in-in ways specific to your own unique physiology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, in order to manipulate the DNA back to a previous state, the program required a precise reference point&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Fortunately, I keep blood samples from all the Atlantis team members for baseline comparisons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't understand what any of you are talking about.</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches over and grabs a startled McKay by the collar.]
</p>

What-what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's good to have you back, buddy!</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls McKay into a tight bear hug.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Yes, well&#8230;it's good to be back.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon releases McKay, slapping him a few times on the back good-naturedly as he grins.]

Ach, terrible!</blockquote>

(worried)<br />
Should I get Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no-no-no-no. Physically, I am fine, but-but this doesn't make any sense! I can't figure out any of these-of these equations. I mean, the algorithms are complete gibberish. I mean, this is torture! I can clearly remember exactly how important this all is, but I cannot figure out why or-or-or how&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I just dropped by to show you this. Your EEG readings from your last meditation.</blockquote>
<p>[She shows him the tablet. He looks at it in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh my god! It's 0.03 hertz! I mean, I did it! I was in the zone; I could've actually ascended!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You said you were floating in a big empty space&#8230;when the idea of how to save yourself came to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I may have momentarily thought about how hard it was to rid oneself of ego, I mean, and-and that existence without the individuality of consciousness would be pointless, but&#8230;Ooh! Now that I say that, that's probably what gave me the idea of how to reprogram the device with my old device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, I thought so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, you know what? I don't care if you don't think I was capable of ascension. I never wanted to do it anyways. In fact, I am very happy with who I am&#8230;and you love me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?! I never&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You so did! Yeah, I may not be able to understand this new math I created, but I distinctly remember that you said you love me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Actually, I said "we" love you, and it&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And what? What, you just said that because you thought I was dying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, I said it because&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See, you love me. It's true! You've said it; now I know. I always suspected it. In fact, you know what, I've always noticed that there's been a, um, indefinable yet magical chemistry between us that I think I covered in chapter ten.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm. Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You had lunch yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mid-afternoon snack, then?</blockquote>

(conceding)<br />
I will keep you company.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands and they start to leave the lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah. Now, is Sheppard still, uh, bugging you to let him use the ascension device to turn himself into some kind of a superhero?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Despite the fact that the Ancient database states that its effects on people are wildly unpredictable, and that I'm just lucky I wasn't, uh, instantly melted down into a pool of protoplasm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Well, maybe you should let him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think not.</blockquote>
