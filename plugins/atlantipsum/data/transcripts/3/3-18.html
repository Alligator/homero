<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Excerpts from 1.18 "The Gift", 1.20 "The Siege Part 2" and 2.01 "The Siege Part 3" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper moves deeply under the Atlantis Ocean.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Weir, Sheppard's team, and a science team are all inside the jumper, looking bored. Teyla moves from the cargo area and approaches McKay, who's sitting behind Sheppard in the front area.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Um, "shotgun," is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unhappy)<br />
Aw, come on. Don't know why I have to do this.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoots him an unsympathetic smile as she takes his seat. McKay moves to the back and sits across from McKay. Zelenka glances at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Nobody said anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you don't have to, do you? Look, it's not my fault things are hard to find on the bottom of the ocean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Rodney, you said you knew where it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I said I knew its last known location. It is a <i>mobile</i> drilling station, remember? Obviously thatâ€™s going to take a few hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If we don't find it soon, this is going to be your last known location.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, zing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, kids, do I have to pull this thing over? It's hard enough being in this damn thing for hours without listening to you guys.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
Actually, Dr. McKay has managed to narrow the search field to a remarkably small area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(preening)<br />
Mmm. Finally, a voice of reason. Thank you, Doctor, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
Graydon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(absently)<br />
Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Uh, I've been here almost eight months.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
Oh. It's been that long, has it? Time certainly flies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Of course, unless you're in a jumper, looking for a needle in a haystack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know what? Shut up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You know what? You shut up, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! I don't hear Grayson complaining.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
Uh, it's Graydon, w-with a "D."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? You sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
I-it's&#8212;it's my name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, 'cause I could've sworn that the guy I wanted for your department was called Grayson, because I remember thinking "Dick Grayson," Bruce Wayne's ward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRAYDON<br />
Well, it's Graydon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Wonder if that means I hired the wrong guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Weir)<br />
Well. Still glad you came?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(drily)<br />
Oh. Sorry. I was preoccupied thinking about the geothermal drilling platform.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It shouldn't take us much longer. We just passed a thermal layer, and I'm getting some readings a couple of hundred feet ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If we did manage to find an alternate and potentially limitless power supply&#8230; well, that would make even this insufferably long search&#8230;seem worthwhile.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, kids, we're here.</blockquote>
<p>[He powers up the HUD and the scientists all gather around to stare at the display.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, hopefully it won't take too much longer to power up this station.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN</b>
</p><p>[The jumper approaches the drilling platform. Lights automatically power on as it draws nearer.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That wasn't so hard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All I've got to do is dock this thing, and&#8230;we can find out what this place is all about.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[A Wraith queen awakens.]
</p><p><b>END OF TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p>'<b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN'</b>
</p><p>[The jumper has docked inside a port.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Scientists and engineers are scattered throughout the station. Weir wanders among them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Weir)<br />
All systems are online and functioning at full capacity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You mean we're generating power already?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, no, but we probably could if we wanted to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, slow down. The Ancients abandoned this project for a reason. Let's try to find out what that reason might be before we start drilling into the planet's crust.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, fair enough.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla patrol the station.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Have we not been down this hallway before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Every corridor looks the same.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't worry, I have an uncanny sense of direction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, I think she's right. We've been down this way before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's impossible. We took a left, and a left, and then a right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey, look, all I'm saying is&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stops abruptly and gasps.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[He and Sheppard turn back.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am sensing a Wraith presence nearby.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure? We're&#8230;pretty deep underwater.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(nervous)<br />
I cannot be certain, but I believe it is onboard the drilling platform.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Sheppard. Everyone drop what you're doing. Get back to the control room immediately.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team has joined Weir and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(patronizing)<br />
We did a complete lifesigns scan. It was the first thing we did when we stepped aboard this station. Look, I promise you, there is nobody here but us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, Rodney. And I am sensing it even closer now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe it's the pressure. Itâ€™s been known to do things to the mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just humor me and check again.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs and works the controls. The life signs detector zooms in on only people in the control room area.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There. All of these lifesigns have been accounted for. Humored?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Wraith don't show up on lifesigns detectors if they're hibernating.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know what I am sensing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There is no Wraith here, I'm telling you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Has your sense ever been wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Never, and I cannot shake this feeling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I trust her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As opposed to irrefutable fact?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Your machines don't know everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I never said that they did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is a way for me to be sure. If I can reach out with my mind and establish a link&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa! That's a little reckless, don't you think?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If there is no Wraith, then there will be no mind for me to link with and therefore no risk. But if there is a Wraith nearby&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We need to know.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CREW QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits on a bench in a crew bunk room, meditating. Sheppard, Weir, and Ronon stand nearby. Bunks are built into alcoves in the walls.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The briefest contact will determine whether or not I'm right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's all we need, so don't stick around any longer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And we will bring you out of it if at the first sign of trouble.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla closes her eyes and starts to breathe deeply.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to Ronon)<br />
Just to be sure&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's already set to stun.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla opens her eyes and glares at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla breathes deeply. Her friends watch worriedly. Teyla shifts her head as if uncomfortable. Her eyes roll back into her head before she comes out of it and awakens.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[They watch her warily.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
I was mistaken. There is nothing there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No reason to be sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps it was the effect of the pressure at this depth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if you've ever seen <i>The Abyss</i>, pressure can make you nuts&#8230;not that I think you're nuts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's all right, John. I'm relieved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So am I. Well, we have a lot of exploring to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Until Rodney delivers the preliminary status report, I'm all yours. Put me to work, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's make up some time. Break into teams. Uh, Ronon, you're with Teyla. Elizabeth, you're with me, or&#8230;I'm with you, however you want to put it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Either way&#8230; or "eyether" way&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes back h is rifle. Ronon returns Teyla's sidearm to her as they split up.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Weir explore a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(sighing)<br />
Well, we are at the very bottom of the ocean. Maybe you're right, Teyla's just experiencing the effects of the pressure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hopefully not as bad as that guy in <i>The Abyss</i>.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla stroll down a different corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This place is big, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla does not respond. Instead, she studies everything.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Nothing. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You just haven't said a word.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Have I not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Has my silence made you&#8230;uncomfortable?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla approaches with a small smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Your friendship is very important to me&#8230; I would hate to do anything that made you&#8230; uncomfortable.</blockquote>
<p>[She clasps him on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay. Well, I'm good.</blockquote>
<p>[He smiles back at her. Teyla immediately knees him in the groin.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<p>[Before Ronon can recover, "Teyla" follows through on her attack with more punches and kicks. Ronon grunts in pain before collapsing to the ground. "Teyla" continues to kick Ronon. Once he is unconscious, she looks around. Seeing and hearing nothing, she continues on with purpose.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>["Teyla" spots a computer terminal. She starts working the controls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The power shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney? What's going on?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay strolls through the room, unconcerned. Power is still on in his area.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
What do you mean, what's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We just lost the lights.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay moves a scientist out of the way and checks his laptop, attached to an Ancient terminal.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Huh. You're right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio, sarcastic)<br />
Yes, we can see that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
We just lost power to forty percent of the station. Sensors are currently off-line. Zelenka, what're you doing?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka studies a terminal with his own computer. He too has power.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Uh, what do you mean, what am I doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Have you lost power where you are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(into radio)<br />
No, have you?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We have.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I want to know what's going on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
You know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few millennia. We're bound to blow a few fuses.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing into radio)<br />
Look, I'll have power back online in a minute. Just hang tight.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts working on his computer, zeroing in on the affected areas.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ronon, Teyla, report your position.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[In another corridor, Ronon lies unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Ronon? Teyla? Come in.</blockquote>

<p>[She ignores the radio.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, we've lost contact with Ronon and Teyla. Do you know their position?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL, ZELENKA'S POSITION</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka looks up, concerned, as he listens to the radio exchange.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
No, negative. Internal sensors are out, but I have determined the location where the power went down.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CORRIDOR, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S LOCATION</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
It's the deck that Ronon and Teyla were exploring.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />

(into radio)<br />
Okay.<br />
(to Dickenson)<br />
Davidson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DICKENSON<br />
(standing)<br />
It's, uh, Dickenson, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatiently)<br />
Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark. Just give me a break here. Look, get back to the jumper, see if you can use its sensors to determine the location of our people within the drilling platform.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DICKENSON<br />
Sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Graydon walks by.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Gray<i>don</i>, you go with him.</blockquote>
<p>[Dickenson and Graydon exchange looks, but comply.]

</p><p>[The Wraith queen swims towards the platform.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay nervously walks down a corridor. He hears a noise and spins around, only to find Sheppard and Weir there. He sighs in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There you are.</blockquote>
<p>[The three of them continue down the corridor with their flashlights.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CONTROL TERMINAL, TEYLA'S LOCATION</b>
</p><p>["Teyla" stares at the display screen. She pushes a button that opens an a crystal access area. Unholstering her sidearm, she shoots the panel, destroying the crystals.]

</p><p>[The gunfire can be heard in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Weapons fire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nine mil. This way.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Weir rush in that direction. McKay hangs back, shaking his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yes, let's race <i>towards</i> the gunfire.</blockquote>
<p>[He follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM ACCESS POOL</b>
</p><p>[In the center of a room sits a round pool. The Wraith queen emerges from its depths, breathing deeply and looking around.]

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ronon, Teyla, come in.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Weir, and McKay cautiously patrol the darkened corridor. Off in a side corridor, Ronon coughs. The trio instantly rush to his side, helping him sit up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(groaning)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Did you see who attacked you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, it was Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
What? W-Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, until we what's going on, I'd like everyone in one place.</blockquote>

Can you make it back to the control room?</blockquote>
<blockquote> ZELENKA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, I think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that doesn't make any sense. What's she doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You and Elizabeth go back to the control room. Ronon and I are going to check up on Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Be careful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No kidding.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, TEYLA'S POSITION</b>
</p><p>[Teyla gasps and half collapses onto the terminal. Catching herself, she looks around the room, confused and panicked. She sees her sidearm lying on the terminal and grabs it, holding it while looking around in wonder and trying to catch her breath. Her back is to the door. She senses something behind her and spins around, her pistol at ready. Sheppard stands there, pointing his own pistol at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Drop it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're way behind schedule. Uh, they're going to send a rescue jumper any minute now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Even if they've left already, I mean, the moment we were overdue&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, they won't make it in time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far is the cruiser?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Um&#8230; Less than a kilometer.</blockquote>
<p>[They look at the display.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She swam that far? What is she?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
A formidable enemy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(inspired)<br />
I have an idea.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM POOL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Weir, and McKay enter. McKay walks over to where some pressure suits are hanging by the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I found these in the database when we first got here. They were used primarily to make repairs to the exterior of the station.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Very cool.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, you should be able to traverse the distance between here and the, uh, cruiser.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean "we."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, yes, of course. We.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir walks over to the pool.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This must be how she got in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Probably. All right, let's get suited up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay walk from the drilling station to the hive ship in pressure suits. McKay is hyperventilating inside his suit.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're breathing too hard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Forgive me for being aware of exactly how much pressure is being exerted on this suit right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just think of it as a walk on the beach&#8230;a beach that's about to explode.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's supposed to make me feel better?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, it's supposed to make you walk faster. We're on the clock here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
This is Weir. How close are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Almost there, but we're running out of time. We may need Teyla to do her Kreskin act again.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir glances over at Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'd rather not have to. I think it could be much too dangerous for her.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So's exploding magma.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I am walking as fast as I can.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Weir enters. Teyla is already there, staring at the queen.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(desperate, but firm)<br />
How do we disarm the self-destruct? You won't survive the blast any more than we will.</blockquote>
<p>[The queen sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I can get the information we need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRATH QUEEN<br />
If you were strong enough, you would have done so already. I can feel how weak you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We shall see who is stronger.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla goes into a meditative trance. The queen sighs, trying to resist.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay take off their suits.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That took too long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I probably won't be able to disarm the self-destruct in time anyway, so we're really not in a rush.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why don't we find it first, and then you can be negative?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, this ship is remarkably preserved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You'd think after 10,000 years, she'd want to redecorate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm serious. Hull damage is minimal. They probably just lost their main drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're saying this thing is salvageable?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'd have to assess damage to the primary systems, but it's not completely out of the question. Of course, you'd probably just go and blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or something, and all that work would be for nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tick, tick, tick&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks his sensor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This way.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla continues to breathe deeply. Suddenly, she gasps.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla throws her head back with a cry and clutches her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH QUEEN<br />
You are weakening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla, I think you should stop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My concentration slipped for just a moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH QUEEN<br />
And in that moment, I could have crushed you with a single thought. Perhaps next time, I will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There isn't going to be a next time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Elizabeth, I am fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, you're not. I can see what this is doing to you. Let's just give McKay a chance.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The alarm pulses.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm pretty sure this is the device, and I'm pretty sure it says we have less than half an hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, turn it off.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to work some controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not accepting commands of any kind. There must be some kind of a-a command code that needs to be entered first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you figure it out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Yes, well, command codes are usually quite simple, like the number "one" or the letter "A," like, in Wraith, which would be, um&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Can you figure out the code or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No! Not if I stood here and tried for a million years, and we have, uh,
(checking his watch)<br />
&#8230;just under a million years less than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Elizabeth, you there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Any luck?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Negative. We don't get her command code in less than 30 minutes, we're dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Still strapped to the gurney, the queen overhears Weir and Teyla speaking in the hall.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is the only way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I told you, Rodney has another idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That may or may not succeed. There is only one way to be certain.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
She said she would kill you next time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will not let that happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No. We're going to give them more time.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir leaves. Teyla watches her go with a cunning expression, then turns back to reenter the room where they're holding the queen.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING STATION CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon. There's been an emergency in the control room. Dr. Weir needs your help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(indicating the queen)<br />
What about her?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla unholsters her sidearm.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will watch the prisoner. Hurry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Watch yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. Teyla lowers her gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH QUEEN<br />
Are you fool enough to try again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have very little to lose.</blockquote>
<p>[The queen sneers as Teyla goes into a meditative trance. The queen gasps, trying to resist. Suddenly Teyla gasps and her eyes open. The queen opens her eyes and watches Teyla. Teyla blankly and turns to the bindings and undoes the straps holding the queen down. Once free, the queen raises her feeding arm to strike, then pauses, her eyes widening.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH QUEEN<br />
You are trying to hide something from me.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stares in fear and shock at the queen, breathing hard.]
</p><p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Sheppard approach Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There's been a development.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You've been able to disarm the self-destruct device?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, but, uh, Rodney thinks if he can tie in a naquadah generator, he can still get the Wraith cruiser to fly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
After all these years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, the damage was superficial. The problem was the engines. McKay's already restored power, and I think&#8230;I can fly the ship to a safe distance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That's a suicide mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if I can ditch the ship on the mainland, maybe I can get far enough away from the explosion. I've got to go now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Wait! Let me try again. If I can get her to give up her command code, you won't have to risk it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're in no condition to do that. Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[The queen smiles, releasing her mental hold on Teyla, who faints. The queen strides down the hall]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN</b>
</p><p>[The queen swims from the drilling platform back to her ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stands by the self-destruct console. Hearing something behind him, he turns. The queen stalks towards him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well. You're a hell of a swimmer, I'll give you that.</blockquote>
<p>[He backs away from the self-destruct nervously as the queen approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH QUEEN<br />
You have restored power?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(casually)<br />
It'll fly.</blockquote>
<p>[The queen reaches the controls and types in the code for the self-destruct abort. It shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH QUEEN<br />
You shall be rewarded&#8230;with a quick death!</blockquote>
<p>[She is shot from behind by McKay, who fires his P-90 at the automatic setting. The queen stays standing and turns, stalking angrily towards McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicking)<br />
She's not dying according to plan here!</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to get away. Sheppard pulls his hidden pistol out and shoots the queen in the back several times. She finally falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you'd forgotten about me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course not. I just had to wait for her to disable the device. Hey, just be thankful she didn't feed on you before she entered the command code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, that's why you didn't want to be bait.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, no, you had to be bait, because she was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the ship.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard seems to consider this logic while McKay nervously studies the queen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She is dead, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DRILLING PLATFORM CREW QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Weir sit on a bunk. Sheppard heads to a different one and sits down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Oh, much better, now that I no longer feel the constant presence of a Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was no ordinary Wraith. It took a lot of bullets to take her down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I wish I was there.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon unbuckles his gun holster and gets into another bunk.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He's right, you know. I mean, deceiving a Wraith queen? That's no small feat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(humble)<br />
Well, when there are so many lives at stake, it's easy to summon the strength.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up. Turns out Atlantis had sent another jumper. It should be here within the hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's good news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, no kidding. I can't wait to see the sun.</blockquote>
<p>[He settles face down on his bunk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? No, no, no. We haven't finished what we came here for. Look, Wraith's gone. We've got a ton of research to do.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir grabs her jacket and stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come up with a way to get auxiliary power online in a couple of days.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Weir leave, Weir throwing a sidelong glance back at Teyla, who smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is he serious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, I for one intend to spend the next little while&#8230;resting.</blockquote>
<p>[She fluffs a pillow.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Same here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Same here. Oh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard lies down.]
