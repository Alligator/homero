<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team walks through the forest. Ronon looks disturbed by the surroundings.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Something wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I have a bad feeling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, I always feel like that. Like something horrible's about to happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How do you live?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I got used to it. Thing is, when someone else also has that feeling, mine gets worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do you recognize this place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't remember.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You must have visited many planets when you were running from the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I didn't count.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks around the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know how you tell them apart.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team enters a small snow-dusted village made up of two rows of animal hide tents with a dirt street in between. The villagers are going about their daily business.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See, there you go. Nothing to worry about. Seems like a perfectly nice village to me, just like dozens of others we've visited.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It appears to be the type of encampment my people trade with all the time. I see no evidence of threatening behavior or danger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I also see nothing we might be interested in trading for.</blockquote>
<p>[One man carrying firewood spots the team and stops. Sheppard smiles and waves in a friendly manner.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi. How ya doin?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
Wraith bringer!</blockquote>
<p>[Terrified, he drops his firewood and runs. The villagers instantly scatter in a panic, repeating his cries of "Wraith bringer!"]
</p>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
Wraith bringer!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />That can't be good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(shouting to villagers)<br />You don't have to be afraid.<br />
(to team)<br />Where are they going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to get out of here, now.</blockquote>
<p>[A villager comes out of a tent carrying a crossbow. McKay turns around to face Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I take it he was talking to you?</blockquote>
<p>[The crossbow wielder fires, hitting McKay in the buttocks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(in a high pitched scream)<br />Aaah! That did not just happened!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Warning fire only!</blockquote>
<p>[As the villager reaches for another bolt, Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon start shooting over the villagers heads.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Move!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard helps McKay limp away as Ronon and Teyla provide cover fire and back away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team escape through the forest, Ronon and Teyla still providing cover from the rear. McKay leans heavily on Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(screaming)<br />Oh my god! It hurts! I can't feel my leg!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is it pain or numbness?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Both!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoots another a volley of fire, then dodges more arrows.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the hell did you do to these people?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't listen to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How can you not recognize the 'gate address?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do you know the symbols of every address of every planet we've been to?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, as a matter of fact!</blockquote>
<p>[Another crossbow bolt strikes the tree near Sheppard's head. He turns around. The villagers are getting closer. Teyla and Ronon take cover behind trees and try to hold them off with weapons fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Go! Get to the 'gate!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Grunting from the effort, Sheppard and the injured McKay make their way to the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go on. We'll be right behind you!</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves McKay to dial while he heads back to help the others.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla continue the firefight. Teyla gets struck by a dart. Ronon sees her collapse unconscious just as she pulls it out. An instant later, he too is struck. He pulls it out and tries to aim, but is dizzy. He too collapses, unconscious.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay finishes dialing the DHD. The Stargate activates. Another crossbow bolt just misses McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh! Damn it!</blockquote>
<p>[He blindly fires his P-90 behind him as cover as he limps to the Stargate. He's able to escape before the village teen can fire again.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard runs back to where he left Teyla and Ronon. He stops short upon noticing Teyla lying prone on the forest floor. An instant later, he is struck by a dart in his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh crap.</blockquote>
<p>[He sinks to his knees before keeling over, unconscious.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay arrives and collapses onto his front the floor of the Gate Room, the arrow still protruding. Weir hurries down the steps. Guards stand ready with their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney! Medical team to the Gate Room!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Yes, ma'am!</blockquote>
<p>[Weir reaches McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney? Hey. Where are the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're right behind me.</blockquote>
<p>[The wormhole shuts down. Still on his stomach, McKay only hears it. His face falls as the medics arrive.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard awakens to find himself, Ronon, and Teyla imprisoned in a primitive cell made of branches. It is clearly cold in the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(brightly)<br />Well, I guess it could be worse.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles wanly but Ronon remains motionless, facing away from the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I know you must be thinking this is your fault&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon still doesn't acknowledge Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have already tried to console him.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stands and comes closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We were bound to run across a planet you'd been to sooner or later.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It was night last time.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[An injured Ronon collapses in the center of the village. A young woman approaches. Her father limps towards her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Linor! Stay away!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINOR<br />
It's a man, father. He's near death.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[Keturah walks through the town, looking towards the makeshift prison.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
You think we would not remember you? We offered you food and shelter.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TENT</b>
</p><p>[Linor nurses Ronon, providing him some broth. As she moves away, Ronon grabs her arm. Keturah starts, concerned for his daughter's safety.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Maybe you did not remember our village. We were forced to rebuild after the Wraith came.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Explosions wreck the village, Wraith guards storm through, firing indiscriminately at the population. One soldier feeds on Linor who screams in agony. Keturah tries to get to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Linor! No!</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
That were not merely culling us as they have in the past&#8230;they were looking for you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Sorry! I doubt that. You will not bring death and destruction on us again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I can't say the Wraith won't be back here again, but I can promise you they're not coming back here because of him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
No! Not once we've sacrificed the Wraith-bringer to his masters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He prefers Ronon. He probably also prefers not to be sacrificed to the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He is a victim of the Wraith, like all of us. His planet was destroyed. He was captured and made a runner, but he is not one anymore. They cannot track him as they once did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
They did not feed on us all last time. They promised that if he ever came back and we captured him, we would be forever free from culling in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(incredulous)<br />They "promised"?! They are Wraith! I promise you that killing Ronon will not change what happened. And it will not protect you in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
I said nothing of killing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Isn't that what "sacrifice" means?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
I know not what his masters will do him once we turn him over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(incredulous)<br />You're giving him to the Wraith?!</blockquote>
<p>[Keturah holds up a small circular disk with a green blinking light&#8212;a Wraith beacon.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
They left this behind so that we could call them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(horrified)<br />He has already activated it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're going to kill all of us! You included!</blockquote>
<p>[Keturah leaves them. Ronon just stares, trying to keep his guilt and emotions in check.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[A semi-conscious McKay lies prone on a table, the arrow still imbedded. Beckett works on him. Weir and a major stand nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(drunkenly)<br />So many colors! All the pretty horses.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What's he talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I gave him some morphine for the pain.</blockquote>
<p>[An SG major bends down to look McKay in the eye.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
(enunciating clearly, and impatiently)<br />I need to know how many villagers. How far is the 'gate from the village?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at the major.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Have you seen a guy around? He looks like you, but he's got messy hair. I think I&#8230;lost him somewhere&#8230;and&#8230;and a-and a pretty girl and a caveman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I may have given him a wee bit too much, but he was making it impossible for me to treat him.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gets distracted by the oxygen cannulus in his nose and starts playing with it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
(annoyed)<br />Snap out of it McKay! It's important! Come on, what kind of weapons do they have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'd say something that shoots arrows is a good guess.</blockquote>
<p>[The major graces Beckett with a sarcastic smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Excuse me, why am I lying here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You have an arrow, Rodney, in your gluteus maximus.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay lies back down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Well, that sounds painful.<br />
(he sighs)<br />Gluteus maxi&#8230;mus. Glute&#8212;&#8230;maaa-xim&#8230;Oh my god! That's my ass, isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(resigned)<br />Aye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Call me if he makes any sense.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon calls to the villager guarding them.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Get him back here&#8230;the leader of your village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
'Cause I need to talk to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
It's too late for you. The Wraith will be here soon.</blockquote>
<p>[Aton draws close to Ronon as he speaks. Ronon reaches out and grabs him, knocking his head into one of the branches serving as bars and pulling him close, turning him to face the outside. He pulls a knife and holds it to Aton's throat while holding him by the hair. The other guards raise their weapons, including the dart gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Shoot me with one of those darts, and I promise he'll be dead before I go down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALIK<br />
Let him go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worriedly)<br />Hey, buddy, you want to fill me in on this plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALIK<br />
Let him go, now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
(petrified)<br />Get Keturah!</blockquote>
<p>[Keturah has already realized the commotion and is headed their way.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
I'm here. Unhand him now! I will not free you. These men will kill your friends first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nervously)<br />I don't think that'll be necessary. Uh, why don't we all put our weapons down and talk about this nicely?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Let them go. It's me the Wraith want. They had nothing to do with what happened here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to Ronon)<br />Don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They won't shoot me. They must know the Wraith still want me alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was a bit more worried about them shooting us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
Please, Keturah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Let him go, now!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon pushes Aton away, then holds the knife to his own jugular. Sheppard and Teyla stare at Ronon in alarm, horrified.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Back off, Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Drop the knife, now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks over to Keturah. Aton stands beside him, still rubbing his neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I didn't mean to bring the Wraith here, but it was my fault!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That isn't true!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You know it is. I should never have come here. I should never have stayed. I'm sorry about what happened to your village, but if you think turning me over to the Wraith will keep you safe, fine, do it! I'll do whatever I have to to make up for what happened, but don't punish them for my mistake. They're good people. You let them go, or I'll be dead before the Wraith get here. I promise. Then see what the Wraith do to you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla exchange worried looks. Ronon has sounded more and more desperate as he speaks, obviously not bluffing.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not leaving. Not without you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(ignoring Sheppard)<br />You let them go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATON<br />
(nervously)<br />We have no issue with the other two.</blockquote>
<p>[Keturah studies Ronon, who is pressing the knife hard into his own throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Let them go.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens and guards drag Sheppard and Teyla out.]
</p>
<blockquote>KETURAH<br />
Resist, and you will be killed.</blockquote>
<p>[Once Sheppard and Teyla are dragged towards the Stargate, Ronon drops his knife hand. As Sheppard and Teyla are led away, Ronon is shot by a dart. Sheppard looks back, haunted.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Chuck sees the Stargate being activated.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Incoming wormhole!</blockquote>
<p>[The chevrons light and the Stargate kawhooshes. Weir arrives. In the Gate Room, the SFs and the Major's team raise their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
It's Colonel Sheppard's IDC, ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Lower the shield!</blockquote>
<p>[She runs down the steps.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla walk through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Someone get us some vests and guns.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
Colonel. Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
We were just about to come get you guys. Where-where's Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[Someone gets the guns and vests and hands them to Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's still back there. Did McKay get through okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, he's gonna be fine. What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon bargained for our freedom.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
By sticking a knife to his own throat. We're going back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Control Room)<br />Dial the 'gate!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It took us fifteen minutes to get to the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(loudly, so all the team can hear)<br />The place could be crawling with Wraith by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
Let's go get him.</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate dials.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A hive ship orbits a planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH SHIP THRONE CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Two guards drag Ronon to the throne room. He is conscious, but can only give a token resistance. They force him to his knees before the Wraith sitting on the throne.]
</p><p>[The Wraith, an older, bald Wraith steps down from his throne and growls at Ronon. Ronon appears to recognize the Wraith, and is frightened of him.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[The Atlantis teams search the village. The encampment is mere debris and the remnants of fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(incredulous)<br />We couldn't have been gone for more than a half-hour!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(soberly)<br />It doesn't take long.</blockquote>
<p>[They come across Keturah's body. Teyla checks, but he is dead.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
As we suspected, the deal did not go as planned.</blockquote>
<p>[The major approaches, carrying some items.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
There's a few dozen bodies here, at most.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The rest were culled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAJOR<br />
We found these.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands Sheppard Ronon's gun and holster. Sheppard looks around, clearly worried.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We'll find him.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship drops out of hyperspace and approaches a planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP LAB</b>
</p><p>[While the head Wraith watches, a Wraith scientist picks up a tracking device with forceps. He heads over to Ronon, who is shirtless, panting in pain and strapped prone onto a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
I once fed from the humans of your homeworld. That is where I will watch you die.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon winces in pain as the tracker is inserted. He is once again a runner.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SATEDA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A dart flies over the ruins of the Satedan city on a cloudy day. It uses its transport beam.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SATEDA STREET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A kneeling Ronon is deposited on the street by the beam. He stands and stares around him.]
</p><p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[Explosions rock the street where Ronon stands as a Wraith dart bombards the area.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[Ronon continues to look around, lost in his memories.]
</p><p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[After the dart passes, Ronon leaves his cover and calls to his squad. He is dressed in a Satedan military uniform.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right, boys! Let's go! Move, move, move!</blockquote>
<p>[He shoots cover fire while the squad escapes and the dart again comes closer.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[Ronon starts running through the street, ignoring the rubble strewn around him. He climbs the fire escape of a building to get a higher view. He looks out on the ruins. As he turns, he winces upon hearing an explosion. A Wraith dart has dropped a bomb.]
</p><p>[A few moments later, the dart beams a Wraith soldier onto the Sateda street. The Wraith wears goggles and looks around. He growls, then pulls his weapon and moves out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DUSK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Teyla, McKay, Beckett, and Weir are all in the conference room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Don't get me wrong, I hope he is, but how can you be certain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They made a sport out of trying to kill him in the past.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He was the one that got away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe they will try again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon will not go down easily.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But they must know how dangerous he can be. It's not like they're going to give him a fair chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, obviously, we don't have much time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How do we find him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If the Wraith place a tracking device in him the way they did last time&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She looks to Sheppard. He turns to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you pick up a signal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />Of course. If it sounds like it might be impossible, you look at me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We still have the tracking device we took out of him.</blockquote>

I thought you might want this.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes it and heads out the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're welcome.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />What the hell is going on down there?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio, quickly, as if talking while running)<br />Ronon thinks he can get the head Wraith responsible for all this to come down and fight him if we kill all these Wraith first.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL STAIRWELL</b>
</p><p>[Ronon blasts two Wraith down the stairwell, then quickly clambers over their bodies as he continues down. Sheppard and Teyla hurry to keep up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />That is the stupidest plan I have ever heard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />I don't know. Killing a bunch of Wraith always seems like a good idea to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />They outnumber you twenty-five to three.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's actually twenty-two to three&#8230;twenty-one.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL STAIRWELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla continue to chase after Ronon, who is not in sight.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />And Ronon appears to be quite angry.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic, into radio)<br />Oh, well, that evens it out. You do realize that there is a hive ship in orbit capable of blowing us all off the face of this planet.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla reach the bottom of the stairwell. Wraith come at them from both directions, and each shoots their rifle, killing them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Beckett gets out of the co-pilot seat and heads to the rear compartment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where do you think you're going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm going to help them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, are you crazy?! You're a doctor!</blockquote>
<p>[He gets up after Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What does that have to do with it?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett pulls out a large rifle from one of the storage compartments. As he turns around with it, McKay tries to tussle it out of his grasp.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You can barely walk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can walk fine, I just can't sit!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And you're a terrible shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, what, and you're Rambo now?</blockquote>
<p>[They continue to play tug-of-war with the weapon.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon stops at a corner and carefully looks around it. Two Wraith guards head towards him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to himself)<br />Oh, man.</blockquote>
<p>[He notices a door ajar at the end of the hallway facing him. It is opening wider. His hand forced, Ronon leaps into the corridor, firing at the two guards. Behind him, another guard comes out the doorway. Ronon is able to down the two, and while sliding to a stop, turn and fire at the third before it can get off a shot.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith leader snarls his frustration. He watches from video feeds by his Wraith guards and witnesses his soldiers being downed one by one, some by Sheppard and Teyla. He roars in fury.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard run to the end of a corridor, firing their P-90s at more guards.]
</p><p>[In another corridor, Ronon turns and ambushes three Wraith guards, firing with energy and barreled pistols before tossing them aside. As a fourth turns the corner, he fires again.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There's more than one bloody gun; we can both go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well someone has to stay with the jumper!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />That's it. We got 'em all&#8230;McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[A surprised Beckett and McKay stop fighting over the rifle. McKay releases his hold and looks over at the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />Yeah. It's just you guys left. Well&#8230;that was quick.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard gives a self-deprecating smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I got six. Teyla got&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Eight.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks nonplussed for a moment, then straightens.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I got nine, Teyla got eight, Ronon got the rest.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoots Sheppard a look.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon bends close to the camera of a downed soldier.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(over video)<br />You wanna watch me die up close? You're just gonna have to come down here and do it yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith leader snarls.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You want me? Come get me!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith leader roars and storms away, passing through the sheer trickle that makes up the video screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'll be waiting.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SATEDA HOSPITAL CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon has rejoined Sheppard and Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(determined)<br />You kill him before I do&#8230;I kill you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What if he kills you first?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then you kill him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nodding)<br />Got it.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Teyla exchange looks, then shrug, resigned and follow Ronon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SATEDA STREET</b>
</p><p>[Ronon stands in the street waiting. A Wraith dart flies, swooping low before beaming down the Wraith leader. They both make shows of bravado, Ronon screaming in rage as he unsheathes his knife and attacks. The Wraith leader blocks his tackle easily, knocking Ronon across the street into a door.]
</p><p>[From a rooftop above, Sheppard and Teyla watch as the Wraith punches Ronon in the head before he can rise. The Wraith then pulls up Ronon by the hair.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I could shoot him right now.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith pulls Ronon to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I wouldn't.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon attacks again. The Wraith either takes or deflects the punches.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You really think Ronon would kill me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I think he wouldn't forgive you.</blockquote>
<p>[Below, Ronon tries to tackle the Wraith. Again the Wraith tosses him aside, throwing him across the street where he cracks a post holding up a porch. Ronon spits out blood as he tries to get to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think he'd get over it.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks up.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The hive has got to be watching. We shoot that Wraith, they'd blast us all from space.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith walks over and kicks Ronon. He punches him several times, dragging him partly up by Ronon's armorplate to get a good angle. Ronon grabs the Wraith's fist as it approaches, using all his strength to hold back the blow. Ronon uses the Wraith's force to get himself back onto his feet. They break apart and again trade blows; again Ronon is knocked down. He tries to crawl away. The Wraith walks over and easily pulls Ronon back by the hair, knocking him onto his back. The Wraith bends low over him, snarling as he raises his hand to feed.]
</p><p>[He is distracted by the jumper uncloaking in front of them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
If he doesn't like it, he can sue me.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett closes his eyes in concentration.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SATEDA STREET</b>
</p><p>[Ronon smiles at the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I win.</blockquote>
<p>[A drone fires from the jumper, slamming into the Wraith and knocking him back. They explode as they impact a building. Ronon rolls over to protect himself from the blast. He smiles as the jumper turns and backs up so the rear ramp is closer to him. Sheppard and Teyla run out of a building and drag Ronon to the jumper as blasts fire at them from above.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Ronon is dropped onto the floor of the rear compartment as Sheppard and Teyla grab handholds.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(yelling to closed door to the front)<br />Go!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SATEDA STREET</b>
</p><p>[The jumper flies out of the narrow street as more bombs strike from above.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Safely in space, Beckett and McKay head to the rear compartment. Ronon is now seated on a bench, Teyla and Sheppard standing beside him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Everyone okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Which one of you killed the Wraith?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and McKay exchange grins.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That would be me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My idea.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon grits his teeth as he forces himself to his feet and approaches in a threatening way.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(warningly)<br />Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Beckett quail.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What? Don't tell me you're not happy that he's dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I had him in my sights, but Ronon said he'd kill me if I shot him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />It was all Beckett's idea.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks from McKay to Beckett, then pulls Beckett into a bear hug.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thanks, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks on in wonder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, him you thank?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I could've killed him at any time, but Teyla wouldn't let me.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla's grin falls as she glares at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thank you. All of you.</blockquote>
<p>[He slaps McKay gently on the chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mollified)<br />Oh, don't mention it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's nothing really. Only killed eleven&#8230;twelve Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rolls her eyes at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How 'bout you sit down, and I get that tracking device out of you&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon slumps back onto the bench.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(continuing)<br />&#8230;and deactivated before the hive ship gets a bead on us. I take it this time, you&#8230;won't mind if I give you a sedative.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon keels over onto the floor, unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Or not.</blockquote>
<p>[He clears his throat and checks on Ronon. Teyla assists. Sheppard looks from Ronon to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who's flying the ship.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay points to himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at him expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay heads back to the front compartment to fly the ship.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies out of Sateda orbit, cloaking along the way.]
