<p><b>EXT&#8212;ALIEN JUNGLE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team hacks their way through the dense foliage.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(frustrated)<br />
What are we doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exploring the Pegasus Galaxy. It's what we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You know what I meant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There certainly doesn't appear to be anything here that would help in our fight against the Wraith, or the Replicators.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on! You guys kill me! Planets are huge you know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, and usually you're the one complaining.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay scoffs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This enthusiasm is most unlike you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We did a standard flyover in the jumper, scanned for life signs&#8212;nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can't fly around for ten minutes and decide there's nothing here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm, yes, I can.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's scanner beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm getting strange energy readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah? From where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't pinpoint the source. The jungle's pretty thick though. It could be hiding just about anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. It's almost as if someone in a warm, cozy room typing at their computer sent us here for their own amusement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You don't really think Zelenka would do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(ominously)<br />
If he did, he's going to be sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do you have any idea how many gate addresses there are in the Ancient database that have no accompanying description?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Forty-two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. I-I think it's a little bit more than that. Look, I don't really remember. That's not the point. Nothing. No information at all. I say, that has to mean something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe that means there was nothing worth writing about on those planets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or there is, but the Ancients are trying to hide it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(dryly)<br />
From themselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A lot of time has passed since the Ancients were around. You know, things change. Maybe there's something here they didn't know about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You have a bet riding on this, don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(innocently)<br />
What makes you say that?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps into a swampy hole. He grits his teeth.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. That's it.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls his foot out of the muck.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm calling this one. Everyone back to the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, come on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Face it, McKay. You lost this one.</blockquote>
<p>[They all turn back. As McKay turns he notices something on a tree trunk light up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Oh? Oh! Hello, what's that, then?</blockquote>
<p>[They all turn around. Sheppard joins McKay, who is studying the object with his scanner. It is a group of crystals nestled on the trunk.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it looks like&#8230;some kind of, uh, natural crystalline growth. I think this might be what's causing the energy readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(intrigued)<br />
Pretty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like one of those toys you play with when you're a kid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, a Commodore 64?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Triple barrel shotgun?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
A kaleidoscope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You realize what this means?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We discovered an alien fungus that glows.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard becomes fascinated with the device, his face reflected in its many facets.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How 'bout a power source that literally grows on trees. Look, admittedly, these energy readings are pretty low level, but uh, if these crystals could be cultivated? Then&#8230;whoa-whoa, wait. What are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reaches forward and touches the device. The instant he touches the object, a spark happens, and he's thrown several feet through the air. He lands on his back with a groan. The crystals darken. Teyla is the first to reach him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, yeah. I'm fine. Just a little shock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That could've been dangerous! I told you it was giving off energy!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, honestly, I&#8230;I don't know why I did that.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Well, you killed it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(unsympathetic)<br />
Oh, really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's not giving off energy anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, maybe you just scared it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't even know if it was alive!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously, why would you touch it?!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Teyla help Sheppard to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know! I said that, okay? I just did! Now, will you leave it at that?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts fooling with scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, well there's got to be more of them around here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatiently)<br />
I'm going to recommend sending a science team back here to check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I am a science team!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods to Ronon, and Sheppard and Teyla start heading back. Ronon grabs McKay by the back of his tactical vest and herds him back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, fine. Let's desert a potentially significant discovery just because you guys don't want me to win a bet with Zelenka?!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits waiting on an exam bed. Teyla stands next to him. Keller approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well your scans are clear. Blood tests are normal. As far as I can tell, you're in perfect health.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
See, I told you.<br />
(to Keller)<br />
Thanks, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No more touching strange things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's good advice.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller heads back to her duties. Sheppard gets up and he and Teyla leave the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's been a long day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, thanks for hanging out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just wanted to be sure.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pats her on the back reassuringly. A strange glow appears and disappears where his hand touched her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm fine. Get some sleep.</blockquote>
<p>[He parts ways with her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(calling after him)<br />
Good night, John.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sleeps restlessly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATHOSIAN HUT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla looks around the setting. She is dressed in formal Athosian gear, her hair like it was before she met the Atlantis team. She turns around to find Sheppard sitting at a table, eating from bowls of fruit and other foods.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is pretty good. What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon appears next to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(smugly)<br />
I knew you two were going to eventually hook up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are not hooking up! It's just dinner!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay wanders by with his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm telling you, there's something in here giving off a strange energy reading.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon has been replaced by Sheppard. His casual manner is gone. His posture is threatening as he stands in front of her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(warily)<br />
John&#8230;? What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel Carter doesn't trust you. No one does but me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's wrong with you?</blockquote>
<p>[He starts circling her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What do you mean? Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've never been the same since you got in the mind of that Wraith queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(unnerved)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Screams and Wraith darts as from a culling are heard outside the tent.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA'S FATHER<br />
(calling from outside)<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Father!</blockquote>
<p>[She goes to the door. As she reaches for the tent flap, it's shoved aside. Sheppard is there, partially transformed by the Iratus bug. He reaches out and grabs her by the throat, pushing her back onto the table. Pinned, she watches as he reaches forward with a "feeding hand" and grabs her brutally.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla awakens from her dream by sitting straight up, gasping and clawing at her chest to push the non-existent hand away. She gasps and cries in relief.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAWN</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla, McKay, and Ronon sit at a table eating breakfast.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I cannot even begin to tell you how bizarre it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Please, you want bizarre? Let me tell you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You know what? Don't.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Morning.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits down with his tray. Teyla stiffens and shifts slightly away from him. Ronon and McKay say nothing, but just look at Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teyla had a dream about you last night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(intrigued)<br />
Really? What was it about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Actually, it was more of a nightmare, and I'd rather not talk about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(teasing)<br />
Was I the dashing hero saving you from a big bad monster?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Actually, you were the big, bad monster.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Like I said, I'd rather not talk about it.</blockquote>
<p>[She stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where are you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sorry. I have a headache. I did not sleep well last night.</blockquote>
<p>[She glares at McKay and Ronon and leaves. Sheppard watches her go, concerned. He turns back to Ronon and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is she really mad at me? I can't control what's in her dreams!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Really? You think you can't control a person's dreams? My father read me <i>Moby Dick</i> when I was seven years old. I mean, seriously, what was the man thinking? Do you have any idea how long I had nightmares about-about being eaten by a whale?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They haven't stopped, have they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla meets with Heightmeyer.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's coming from outside. I go to the opening. I hear darts. I pull open the tent, and&#8230;he comes inside. I know it's not really Colonel Sheppard, but I can't help but feel different towards him. Do you think it's my&#8230;subconscious trying to tell me something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
If there is something real going on between you and Colonel Sheppard that you feel you need to address, you definitely should. Otherwise, don't let it bother you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I've had horrible nightmares before. Of my father being taken when I was a little girl. The cullings since. But none of them have felt like this. When I woke up, I could barely catch my breath. I know it sounds silly, but&#8230;I think I'm actually afraid of falling asleep.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits on a bed. Keller takes off a blood pressure cuff.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well&#8230;physically, there's nothing wrong with you. Other than the symptoms you've described, which can all be attributed to lack of sleep. These should help for the short term. But&#8230;if the problem persist, you definitely need to come back.</blockquote>
<p>[She unlocks the medicine cabinet and takes out some pills.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You have no idea how good the thought of a solid night's sleep makes me feel at this point.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller hands her the pills.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, I think I do. I'm not sure I've had one since I got here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[She waves the pill bottle, then claps Keller gratefully on the arm as she leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Don't mention it. Have a good night.</blockquote>
<p>[She watches Teyla leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KELLER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[The radio beside Keller's bed squawks to life. She opens her eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEDIC<br />
(over radio)<br />
Doctor Keller, we have a medical emergency. Doctor Keller, please report immediately to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<p>[She turns on her bedside lamp and looks at her watch. She gets out of bed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller rushes in. She is still in her nightclothes. Teyla lies on a bed, groaning in agony. Marie and Sheppard are on either side of her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
It's Teyla. She's in severe abdominal distress. Said you gave her some medication?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I prescribed some Ambien to help her sleep. Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla cries out in distress.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Went to the mess for a late night snack. She started complaining about her stomach, and then she just doubled over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I thought you were going to bed. Did you take one of those pills I gave you?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rolls her eyes and writhes.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(soothingly)<br />
Okay, just try to relax. Here, let me have a look.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla turns onto her back, screaming in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hold her for me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Marie, and a medic hold Teyla down. Keller starts feeling around her stomach. Something moves under Teyla's skin. Keller jumps back in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh my God!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller backs away. The thing stretches Teyla's skin further. Teyla screams. Keller meets Sheppard's eyes, he appears to find this all entertaining.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Doctor, do something!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh&#8230;okay, uh, we need to&#8230;sedate her. And uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla screams again. The thing breaks through her stomach, spraying blood everywhere, even on Keller, who is several feet away by this point.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(horrified)<br />
Oh God!</blockquote>
<p>[A giant spider-like insect climbs out of Teyla's corpse. Sheppard looks delighted.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you believe this?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller stares in shock.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KELLER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Keller bolts upright in bed, breathing heavily.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[The room is empty. Keller enters and heads directly for the medicine cabinet and unlocks it. She grabs some Ambien, sighing heavily. She turns around to find Ronon and Sheppard directly behind her. Ronon has a cut on his forehead. She jumps back in alarm.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sorry, Doc. Didn't mean to scare you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We were sparring. I got in a lucky shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's the middle of the night!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Sit down, let me have a look.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon complies. Keller looks at the wound.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(admonishing)<br />
You're going to need stitches.</blockquote>
<p>[She looks over at Sheppard, who is trying not to look amused. Ronon seems to be equally unfazed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Guess I taught him too much, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, I guess so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
You know, you don't need to stick around. I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah. I want a rematch tomorrow, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Good night.</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries out. Keller has been watching the exchange, especially Sheppard, very warily. Ronon turns back and sees she's distracted.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Something wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(snapping out of her reverie)<br />
Hmm? No. Nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes back to studying the wound. Sitting on the bed, Ronon is still much taller than she.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't think he's seeing anyone, you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh! Oh no. That's quite all right&#8230;you know, this would be easier if you lay [sic] down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He does so, and Keller prepares to start stitching the wound.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon walks down the corridor, a flesh-colored bandage on his forehead. He notices no one is around. He enters the Gate Room.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[He wanders through the Control Room, which is also empty.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(yelling)<br />
Is anyone here?</blockquote>
<p>[Panicked, he starts running. He leaps down the stairs and starts running through more corridors.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Anyone?!</blockquote>
<p>[He gets to a door and waves it to open. The door opens, revealing a forest. The atmosphere is cold and foggy. Ronon looks around, then goes into the forest.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The forest surrounds him, with no way back to Atlantis. Laser blasts start to cut through the trees at him. Ronon dodges and runs to avoid the blasts, which come from everywhere. A stick appears out of nowhere, knocking him in the chest. Ronon falls to the ground, his breath knocked out of him. Sheppard appears from behind the tree, one hand behind his back.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, buddy. What are you running from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
C'mon.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts out his hand to help Ronon up, then hits him in the head with a large stick. Ronon blacks out.]
</p><p>[Ronon regains consciousness to find himself bound and gagged and lying in an open grave. Sheppard stands above him shoveling dirt inside. Ronon tries to cry for help and struggles to throw the dirt off of himself, but Sheppard keeps shoveling it into the grave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon awakens with a start, grabbing Keller's wrist from where she works on his forehead.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm really sorry. Did I-did I hurt you?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks around to find himself lying on the infirmary bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Uh, no. No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You fell asleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I was having the strangest dream.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You sure you're okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah. Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm almost done.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller gets back to work.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Keller sits at a table with Teyla, McKay, and Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It was terrifying. There you were with this disgusting alien bug crawling out of your stomach, and Colonel Sheppard was acting like it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That sounds like that movie.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, <i>Alien</i>. Have you seen it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard speaks of it often.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I still remember the first time I saw it. I certainly did not think it was cool.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
One time in med school, I made the mistake of confiding to my partner in biology class that it had caused my all time worst nightmares. He actually planted a live snake inside a cadaver I was working on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Well I never saw it as a kid. I knew from the poster it was gonna be too scary. No, I was sixteen when a uh, neighborhood theater, had a, uh, horror revival festival. I thought, you know, great, date movie. So, Jocelyn Rutger, third period science, uh, bit of a geek, but uh, she had a great&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to gesture, then realizes his mixed company.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

Acting most unlike Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>

Yeah, I said nightmare. Not delusional male fantasy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(irked)<br />
Wait! And listen! Turns out she was serving lemon chicken. I mean, lemon! And the only reason she invited me to dinner was to tell me that she was promoting Zelenka over me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(squirming)<br />
Then I was eaten by a whale. Don't ask how that happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, do you guys really think I'm crazy? I realize they're-they're just dreams. But&#8230;first it was Teyla. And then right after you came to see me, I had one.</blockquote>

And that's when mine stopped. Those pills you gave me knocked me out cold.</blockquote>

Believe me, I've seen a good hunch go a long way in some pretty crazy circumstances. I'd always rather you were on your toes, especially with anything that seems suspicious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know a few bad dreams isn't that significant. It's only natural given what we face on a daily basis. But, this was different. It really rattled me. Coupled with a sequential pattern.

Hopefully, we'll be able to determine if someone is actually carrying one of these creatures around inside of them.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay have leads attached to their heads and cardiac monitors. McKay has an IV. They look at each other across the gurneys.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
You sure about this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm pretty screwed up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're telling me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We're ready if you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I haven't done anything yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
For trying. And don't say I didn't warn you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Administering sedative.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay falls asleep. Sheppard looks around.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nothing's happening here.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller watches a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He's not dreaming yet.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay rows a rowboat in a terrible lightning and rain storm. Atlantis is in the far distance. McKay hears a whale. He stops rowing and sees the whale breach the surface.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh boy. Nice whale. Nice whale. You're my friend. You don't want to eat me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Give up. You'll never make it. You're too weak.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits in the stern of the boat, facing Rodney, arms crossed. He has on his black uniform rather than the sweater Sheppard was wearing in the isolation room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, thank you. Thanks for the encouragement. Way to help out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why would I want to help you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because I thought you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not me, Rodney. Don't listen to him.</blockquote>
<p>[The real Sheppard sits in the bow of the boat behind McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
You're pathetic. You might as well jump in!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't be afraid.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks between the two Sheppards and shakes his head, trying not to panic.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh God&#8230;I have to get back. I have to get back. That's my only chance.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts rowing again.]
</p>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
You're gonna die out here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shut up! Don't listen to him, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's easy for you to say! Why don't you help me row!</blockquote>
<p>[Before McKay can turn back around, Sheppard appears beside him, taking an oar. McKay looks at Sheppard in surprise, then tries to row in rhythm with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, this really isn't as strange as you led me to believe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh yeah? What about that?</blockquote>
<p>[He points behind them. Sheppard turns and sees a frowning clown sitting in the bow.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hate clowns.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking around)<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<p>[They redouble their rowing efforts.]
</p>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
You can paddle all you want to. You're not going anywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's right. I'm gonna die out here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He wants you to be afraid. Don't give him what he wants! He can't really hurt you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
That's where you're wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[From below them, a huge whale with shark-like jaws comes straight up out of the water and swallows the boat and its occupants whole.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard wakes, sweating, and starts to sit up. A monitor nearby flatlines.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(disoriented)<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Clear!</blockquote>
<p>[She uses the defibrillator on McKay, who doesn't respond. Holding a respirator, Zelenka turns to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
He's in cardiac arrest.</blockquote>
<p>[They perform CPR on McKay, but the monitor still shows no response.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm sorry. I've done all I can. He's dead.</blockquote>
<p>[In shock, Sheppard looks up at the observation room to the others' shocked faces.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard moves slowly through the corridor, still in shock. He stops as if he can't go on. Teyla approaches quickly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is all your fault, John!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If you hadn't touched that stupid rock, McKay would still be alive right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I thought you were going to help him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I tried.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Some friend you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Colonel, you've been compromised. I'm relieving you of duty.</blockquote>
<p>[In the background, Sheppard sees his dream doppelganger watching.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Son of a bitch.</blockquote>
<p>[He runs and tackles the other Sheppard. They fall through the wall as if it is an illusions.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Clear!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller uses the defibrillator on McKay. A sinus rhythm starts. McKay soon regains consciousness and looks around in confusion.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, it's okay! It's okay. Just try to relax.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disoriented)<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You were in cardiac arrest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The entity&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's in Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[They all look over at Sheppard, lying unmoving on the bed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DREAM ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The two Sheppards have landed on the floor of the Gate Room. Dream-Sheppard smirks as throws Sheppard off of him. They break apart and stand. The wormhole is active.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can quit now. I'm not afraid of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, yes you are. I'm the one thing you <i>are</i> afraid of. You failed your friends. You brought this on them, and there is NOTHING you can do to stop it!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard attacks, and they exchange blows and kicks. Dream-Sheppard gains the advantage, knocking Sheppard to his knees. Sheppard still doesn't quit, but he is losing quickly. Dream-Sheppard throws him into a wall. He lands on the floor, dazed. Dream-Sheppard picks him up by the shirt and tosses him all the way up the staircase to the control room then walks up the steps after him. Sheppard barely gets to his feet before the punches again fall.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Keller studies the monitors above Sheppard's gurney.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
His heart rate is dangerously high.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(from control room)<br />
Can you wake him up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I could try, but in his physical state, that could make things worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, and the entity would still be in him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hook me up to him again.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DREAM ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is able to land some punches, but Dream-Sheppard still has the advantage. He kicks Sheppard several times, finally knocking him over the railing and back onto the Gate Room floor. Dream-Sheppard leaps after him, landing on his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
Get up! Come on, John. Fight!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard remains curled in a semi-fetal position while Dream-Sheppard approaches him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. That's what you want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
It's your fault Heightmeyer's dead. Your fault McKay is dead!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not dead!</blockquote>
<p>[Dream-Sheppard turns to see McKay walking down the staircase. Enraged, Dream-Sheppard rushes McKay, knocking him into a pillar.]
</p>
<blockquote>DREAM-SHEPPARD<br />
You can't win.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, we can. You're vulnerable to electric shock. That's why I'm still alive. You left before you could finish the job!</blockquote>
<p>[An electrical shock courses through Dream-Sheppard. He releases McKay and backs away, yelling in pain. A surprised Sheppard sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Keller is using the defibrillator paddles to shock Sheppard. She does it  again.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DREAM ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Another shock courses through Dream-Sheppard, who's fallen to his knees. Sheppard gets up and grabs his doppelganger. They spin around as Sheppard gains momentum before tossing the other into the wormhole. McKay nervously approaches the survivor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which one are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good you or bad you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Me me! Is that&#8230;you you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[They both look around.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, this is really weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're telling me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, I thought there'd be more&#8230;hot girls.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka sets the controls on the containment chamber where the entity has now returned to its crystal base. Keller removes the leads from McKay's head as he awakens. Sheppard also wakes up. They look at each other then settle back onto their pillows. Everyone in the control room is relieved.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ALIEN PLANET JUNGLE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The team, wearing hazmat suits, drop the two active crystals onto the forest floor. A strange song comes from them. All around the team, more crystals begin to light on neighboring trees, spreading throughout the jungle.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I have an idea. How about we get out of here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sounds like a plan.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits at a table in the otherwise empty room. He eats a snack and reads. Teyla approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Couldn't sleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, me too.</blockquote>
<p>[She sits down.]
</p><p>[Later, McKay joins them with a full tray.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I thought I'd have a little snack before I uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we couldn't sleep either.</blockquote>
<p>[Soon Ronon joins them as well.]
</p><p>[Later, Keller and Carter round out the table.]
