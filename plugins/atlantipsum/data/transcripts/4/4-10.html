<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka sit at separate laptop stations.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Initiating secondary diagnostics&#8230;now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No variances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm, Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Positive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKYA<br />
Well, check again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Rodney, there's nothing here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, just get over here and monitor power readings.</blockquote>
<p>[He makes Zelenka switch places with him. Zelenka complies with long-suffering resignation. McKay studies Zelenka's computer's readings.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. No variances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you catching any discrepancies on your end?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(irked)<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, just&#8230;go back-go back-go back, go back, go back.</blockquote>
<p>[He shoos Zelenka with his hand and makes them switch back. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, do we know what the problem is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, the 'gate's not working.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I think we figured that much last week when you broke it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
I did not break the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It just happened to stop working around the same time you were screwing around with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I wasn't screwing around with it! I was running a streamlining program designed to boost its operating efficiency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, well, good job.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka watches the interplay with interest, stifling his expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It had nothing to do with why the gate <i>malfunctioned</i>. Look, we've been able to eliminate a number of possible reasons, including my streamlining program. And I feel confident that we're making some progress, and that things will be up and running in&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[There is a distant thump that reverberates through the room. An alarm sounds.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
An unidentified object has struck the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, why didn't the sensors pick it up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
I don't know. It came in so fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm getting a low-level energy signature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What could it be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's find out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grabs a handheld scanner as he follows Zelenka and Sheppard out of the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;READING LIBRARY</b>
</p><p>[There is a large hole in the ceiling of the room. A security team and a scientist are already there, the scientist scanning the object that struck the room as Sheppard, McKay, and Zelenka enter. The object is about a meter in length and mostly cylindrical.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any injuries?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
No, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank god it hit the reading library, or someone really could've gotten hurt.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Zelenka take over from the scientist.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's obviously some kind of mobile self-contained unit&#8212;a drone, possibly a probe. It's definitely not Wraith design.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Perhaps it's Lantian. You know, a de-orbited satellite or a device on a recall directive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, maybe. It's still emanating a trace energy field.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(leaning back)<br />
Oh, is it dangerous?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, it's just interesting.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard notices a scrape marking the side.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Check that out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It was damaged on re-entry, so what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Re-entry wouldn't have caused that.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka looks from McKay to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It looks like weapons' fire. Maybe it took a hit before it came down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And yet it came out in one piece.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tough little bastard.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Lorne speaks to a guard, noticing Sheppard leaving. They start walking together.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Colonel, do we know what it is yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like a probe of some kind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Any idea who sent it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Well, in the meantime, who's working on the 'gate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The 'gate can wait. This is more important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Well, with all due respect, sir, I think they're equally important. Wouldn't it make more sense to keep Zelenka working on this mystery object and move McKay back to his 'gate diagnostics? It's already been over a week now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sternly)<br />
Major, not being able to use the 'gate is an inconvenience. The possibility that someone may have pinpointed our location is a threat. The threat gets priority.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(chastised)<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks off. Lorne watches him go.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay munches on a sandwich while studying a computer. Zelenka works on another computer. Both are hooked up to the object.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
This is pointless. Even though the object survived reentry physically intact, its internal systems are shot. These are just&#8230;incomprehensible readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mouth full)<br />
By design.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(sighing)<br />
There's no design here, Rodney. It's just meaningless data.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mouth full)<br />
Ah, but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an advanced masking system&#8212;to fool us. They're good; I'm better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Who's "they", Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay swallows, ignoring Zelenka's question.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just, um, do me a favor. Relaunch your decrypt sweep.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka gives McKay a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Humor me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Fine.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts typing. When finished, he looks at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You realize we don't have to stand around here waiting for the results. It could take hours. Why don't we go back to the 'gate?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stares at the screen. The gibberish on the screen begins to organize into set patterns.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hang on. It's working. I'm getting something.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka starts typing furiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, n-n-no, no no. Don't touch anything.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka abruptly stops typing and looks at McKay.]
</p><p>[McKay watches as the data finally organizes into set patterns and legible data. An instant later the power shuts down, shorting all the computers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What happened? What did you do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(innocently)<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I told you not to touch anything!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I didn't touch anything. The diagnostic program must've crashed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We lost all the data!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What did you see, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking worried)<br />
Nanite code. It's the Replicators.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard walks down a corridor. McKay bursts out of a side door]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the Replicators. They found us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That drone we recovered contained nanites.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You cannot be certain of that, Rodney. The program went down before we had a chance to retrieve any significant data.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(insistently)<br />
I know what I saw. It was nanite code a split second before the system crashed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(skeptically)<br />
I saw nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's because you weren't looking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Our laptops were feeding the same data stream. If there had been anything, I would've seen it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, obviously, you didn't! Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this dis&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[They hear another distant explosion.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Another one!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, Major Lorne here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
There's been an explosion in Doctor McKay's lab. I suggest you get down here.</blockquote>
<p>[The three hurry off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[They enter McKay's lab. Lorne and a team study the remains. The center table is destroyed, the central section where the object was is completely gone. The table is barely together. Charred items are scattered everywhere.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wha&#8230;what happened?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard picks up a piece of debris.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, either your sandwich exploded, or that mystery drone had a built in self-destruct protocol.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We must've inadvertently initiated it when we ran our analysis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Sorry, Doc. At least you weren't around when it went off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(flatly)<br />
Lucky us.</blockquote>
<p>[He stares at Zelenka.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay walks with Sheppard, watching that no one in the crowded hallway overhears as he speaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Something's not right. That diagnostic program should never have crashed. It was perfectly capable of handling any of the data coming from the probe. And then before I get a chance to get it up and running again, what happens? The probe gets destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
I don't know. I just&#8212;it just feels like someone or something is working very hard to get in my way. And yes, I know what that sounds like. Just&#8230;do me a favor, keep an eye open, okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRACTICE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon spar with the short bantu sticks. They come to a standoff and break apart.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You think he's imagining it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe he needs a vacation.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon attacks again. He strikes a on Sheppard's back before they break apart. Sheppard grunts in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess you disagree, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Eh, I don't know. It just seems like people are acting different lately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Different?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know how to explain it. They just, uh&#8230;haven't been themselves.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is first to attack this time. They trade several blows before breaking apart.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla's noticed it too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe everyone's getting a little stir-crazy not being able to get off-world, you know, acting a little&#8230;weird, getting a little paranoid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm not paranoid!</blockquote>
<p>[He attacks, Sheppard counters, finally kicking Ronon back.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
People have been acting weird lately.</blockquote>
<p>[He comes at Sheppard again, this time catching Sheppard along the temple with his stick. Sheppard wobbles, dizzy for a moment. His forehead over his eyebrow has a long, deep gash.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You make a compelling argument.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're gonna need stitches.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon grabs a towel and hands it to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Here&#8230; Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[He smirks in a completely unapologetic way. Sheppard grunts and nods, holding the towel over the cut.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard still holds the towel to his forehead, keeping pressure on the wound as he enters. Keller gets up from her computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, Ronon decided to know some sense into me.</blockquote>
<p>[He hops up onto a bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hmm. Let me take a look.</blockquote>
<p>[She grabs some gloves and peers closely at his forehead. There is some dried blood over his eye, but no open wound. She smiles and shakes her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(startled)<br />
No stitches?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No. Not even a band-aid. There's nothing there.</blockquote>
<p>[She hands him a small mirror for him to look for himself. Sheppard peers closely, wiping away any remaining blood.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I'm bleeding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, not from any head wound. It was probably Ronon's blood.</blockquote>
<p>[She looks evasive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. He hit me. I was bleeding
(alarmed)<br />
Run a scan on me.</blockquote>
<p>[He heads over the scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(startled)<br />
A scan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If McKay is right and there were nanites in that probe, there's a good chance I got infected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nervous)<br />
Uh, okay. Uh, hold still.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard lies unmoving under the scanner as it runs. Keller shifts the monitor slightly so Sheppard cannot see.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No nanites. You're clean.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits up, thinking carefully.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Run a blood test.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
John, if you were infected with nanites, I would&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Forget the nanites. Something like this happened to me before. I got infected with a retrovirus, and I was able to heal right away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm sure that's not the case now, since you haven't been exposed&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I seriously doubt&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting sharply)<br />
Just run&#8230;a blood test!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes to the cabinet to get the materials. Sheppard watches her go, biting his lip.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;EMPTY ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and Keller talk in a small empty room off a quiet corridor.\
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I thought the problem was dealt with. I destroyed the drone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
And made them suspicious in the process.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
So what do you suggest we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
They're still a long way from knowing the truth. For now, we just&#8230;need to be careful.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard walks down a corridor. Keller hurries to catch up, holding a folder.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(brightly)<br />
Colonel! I got your test results back. I'm pleased to tell you you're one hundred percent bug free. No sign of the retrovirus in your system.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at the tablet computer, then hands it back, his expression sober. They begin walking again.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What's the matter? I thought you'd be happy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All that says is my blood's clean. It doesn't explain the magical head wound.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, maybe it doesn't make sense because you're refusing to consider the only possible explanation for what happened&#8230;You made a mistake.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stops and turns to face her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon wasn't bleeding. I checked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, maybe the blood was already on the towel, and you mistakenly transferred it to your forehead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(suspicious)<br />
Ronon saw the cut. He was the one who said I needed stitches. Unless he was wrong too?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller struggles to keep a blank, pleasant demeanor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
All right. Well, I'll run your blood work again, and if I still can't find anything, we'll do a complete physical.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard watches her walk off, unhappy.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters his lab to find all of his teammates already there.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you all doing here? What's going on?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard holds up a large combat knife blade and looks at McKay in a casually threatening way.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;I'll be right back. I just remembered I forgot to unplug something&#8230;or-or plug it in.</blockquote>
<p>[He moves to leave but Ronon pins his arms, holding him in place. Sheppard reaches out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicking)<br />
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Wh-wh-Wait, hey, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard grabs McKay's hand and holds the blade over it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This may hurt a little.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(terrified)<br />
What are you&#8230;No! Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard draws the knife across McKay's palm. McKay stifles a cry of pain as his hand begins to bleed. Ronon releases his hold on McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is the matter with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard hands McKay a white cloth. McKay obediently holds it to his injury.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm going to need more than that. I'm gonna need disinfectant, or some stitches&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sternly)<br />
Just shut up and hold on a second.</blockquote>
<p>[A frightened McKay looks from Sheppard to Ronon. After another few seconds&#8230;]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Let's take a look.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay removes the cloth. His hand has no injury. Ronon rolls his eyes, unsurprised, as Sheppard and Teyla exchange knowing looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
It's gone. That's impossible. How can-how can it&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's the reaction we were hoping for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If it's any consolation, I can assure you, we all underwent the same test.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Test? Wh-what test? What the hell is going on here?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(determined)<br />
That's what we'd like to find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney, you're not the only one who's noticed the strange behavior of many of the people on this base. They've been acting&#8230;unusually withdrawn, even secretive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah&#8230;I wasn't sure what to make of it. At first, I was ready to dismiss Zelenka's screw-up as just, uh, gross incompetence. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I thought it didn't make sense, even for him. No no. That was no accident. I mean, he crashed that diagnostic system on purpose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm assuming what happened with that drone is no accident either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But what does any of this have to do with my super-healing abilities?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Last night, Ronon clubbed me in the head.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(shrugging)<br />
By accident&#8230;sort of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was cut. I went to the infirmary to have Keller check it out. By the time I got there, it was completely healed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, but the last time that happened, it was the, er, the retro-virus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what I thought, so I had her run a blood test.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(skeptically)<br />
She said she didn't find anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(taken aback)<br />
What, you think she's lying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know, but we gotta find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I can access the infirmary's database from here. I just&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures to make sure he can move now. Ronon gestures for him to go ahead. McKay goes to his computer and starts accessing files.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I'm in. Now&#8230;and&#8230;huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there's no record of any blood test. If she did one, then she didn't enter the results.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CLONE MCKAY<br />
This is the core drive of a Replicator ship tracking system. Once it is up and running, we'll be able to track every "Aurora class" Replicator ship in the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE SHEPPARD<br />
It's not much, but it's a start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you kidding? This is huge! We've got to get working on a&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY AND CLONE MCKAY<br />
Modification program!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE MCKAY<br />
Reconfigure the base sequencing&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Run through one of the Ancient relays so the information is&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY AND CLONE MCKAY<br />
Automatically adapted and outputted!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Outputted?" Is that even a word?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course it is!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE MCKAY<br />
We can't both be wrong. Look, we need to get started on this now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa, whoa! Not so fast! Where do you plan on doing this? We're too big of a security risk to be allowed back on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's got a&#8230;<i>I've</i> got a point. You two are going to have to find another way to do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not a problem. I'll just go back to Atlantis, and, uh, get what we need. We can, uh, do all the work right here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Oh, this is great! Finally, someone in whom I can have one hundred percent confidence! I cannot tell you how much I'm looking forward to working with you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard exchanges disturbed looks with his clone. Teyla looks disturbed as well.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And this is just the beginning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE MCKAY<br />
Humanity's about to benefit from one of the greatest living scientific minds&#8230;times two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Can you imagine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE SHEPPARD<br />
I'm trying not to.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rolls his eyes and nods in agreement. The two McKays are giddy and oblivious as they head off to start work.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, We appreciate all this, but the truth is, we came here for another reason. You were with the Replicators. What do you know about our Elizabeth, and are you willing to help us get her back?</blockquote>
<p>[Clone Sheppard exchanges looks with his Weir.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard walks with the clone Weir through the woods.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think this other Keller was telling the truth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't know why she'd lie.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's kind of weird, that's all. I mean, I don't see you for all this time, and then five minutes later, I find out&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
&#8230;that I'm dead. Hmm. Yeah. Don't worry, the moment I learned the truth, I knew there'd be no going back to the way things were. Not for me, not for any of us.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANOTHER PART OF M34-227 FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon walk through the woods.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know. It's odd.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I know I'm me. So who the hell's this other guy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He is you as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No. There's only one me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Apparently not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He's nothing but a copy then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
From what I understand, even though he's not the original, he's as much Ronon Dex as you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't like it.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FIELD M34-227, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The clone Teyla and clone Ronon walk through a field near the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
I didn't really believe it&#8230;not until we got here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
(despondent)<br />
I know. I was holding out hope as well. I thought that the Replicators had captured us, implanted the nanites, and that they were&#8230;lying to us to keep us from wanting to return.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
Yeah, well it worked. I'm not going back with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
Ronon&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
What? I've been on my own before. At least, that's how I remember it. Now I've got these nanites that'll heal me if I get injured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
You are not invincible. The nanites can only do so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
I understand your anger and your disappointment, but it makes no difference who came first. You are as much Ronon as he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
Oh yeah? Then why does he get my life on Atlantis while I'm treated like an outsider?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
Our circumstances are different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
(sneering)<br />
You mean, we make them feel uncomfortable, so they'd rather not have us around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
(bitter)<br />
Given our origins, they see us as a potential threat. Can you blame them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
I guess not. I'd probably do the same Still, that doesn't change the&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The pair run into the original Ronon and Teyla. They stare at each other awkwardly for a few moments.]
</p>
<blockquote>CLONE RONON<br />
(loudly)<br />
We'll go back to the camp!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We'll go find Sheppard and Weir.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Weir continue to walk together.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's not like this hasn't happened before. The other Elizabeth got infected by those little nanite things, and we figured out how to stop them&#8230;somehow. Maybe we can do the same for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(realizing)<br />
So we wouldn't be a security threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
You can contribute. Things'll just be&#8230;different.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's not really the issue, John. I guess what really bothers me is just knowing that you and the others will always consider me "less" than what I really am.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard grimaces as he looks at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's not true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of course it is, and I don't blame you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard hears a rumbling sound in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do you hear something?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, TEYLA AND RONON'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon pause, also hearing the loud, mechanical rumbling noise.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, SHEPPARD AND WEIR'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla, please respond.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, TEYLA AND RONON'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
The Replicators. They're here!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, SHEPPARD AND WEIR'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They managed to track the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
John do you hear me?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, sotto voce)<br />
Oh yeah, I heard you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Weir spy an Aurora class ship passing slowly by a gap in the trees.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Our ship must've had a hidden subspace transponder.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Run.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir runs ahead of Sheppard. Their path is blasted by drone weapons hitting and exploding around them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TENT</b>
</p><p>[The two McKays look up from their work as they hear the distant bombing.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<p>[His clone goes to the tent entrance to look outside.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, TEYLA AND RONON'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That way. Come on!</blockquote>
<p>[He runs towards the sounds.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon, wait!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, WEIR AND SHEPPARD'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Sheppard continue to run between the field and the forest. Weir is knocked down by the concussion of a blast but Sheppard helps her up. They meet up with Ronon and Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He's still at the compound.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, this is Sheppard. I need you to fall back to the 'gate immediately!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JORDAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel, this is Major Jordan. The 'gate is a no-go. I repeat, the 'gate is a no-go. There's a Replicator ship in position ready to take us out the second we show ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right, everybody fall back to the jumper. Rodney, did you hear me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yeah, I heard you. We're on our way.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard begins to move out.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
John..? They're guarding the 'gate. They have us trapped. Even cloaked, if the jumper so much as rustles a bush, they will pinpoint our position and blast us out of the sky. We need a diversion.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The two McKays run through the forest. They encounter the clone Teyla and clone Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>CLONE TEYLA<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the Replicators. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[They all continue to head to the jumper.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, WEIR AND COMPANY'S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We'll all have a better chance this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't want you doing this, because you feel any less, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Human?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks uncomfortable.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
From the beginning, we've been trying to convince ourselves that we're just like you. Not we've got a chance to prove it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[They head out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Two Replicator ships hover over the Stargate clearing. A jumper flies by, and the two ships immediately give chase. As they leave, the Stargate activates. The jumper tries to cloak, but a blast knocks out the mechanism. Another blast knocks off their port engine and the jumper spirals into a crash.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M34-227 FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A group of Replicators walk through the forest, reaching the crashed jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[They cautiously enter, seeing the bodies of Weir and Ronon. They go up to the pilot chair and pull the pilot upright. It is a Sheppard, who's conscious, the wounds on his face healing via nanites as they stare at him in puzzlement.]
</p>
<blockquote>CLONE SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we tricked you. But don't feel so bad. After all, we almost had ourselves convinced.</blockquote>
<p>[The Replicator fires his weapon at Clone Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's and Jordan's teams run through the wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(calling out)<br />
Shut it down!<br />
(more quietly)<br />
No one else is coming.</blockquote>
<p>[The others look crestfallen.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and McKay work at different computer stations. The Replicator core is next to McKay's computer. Zelenka rubs his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(sighing)<br />
Shall we take a break?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, Rodney, you've been working for five hours straight. You should take a break.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(focused on his work)<br />
Eh, I will&#8230;when I'm finished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I know what you're trying to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted)<br />
And what's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Lose yourself in your work to avoid thinking about Elizabeth. You must realize it's only a temporary distraction.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stiffens and crosses his arms.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's one of the perks of the job. If something terrible happens, you don't have time to dwell on it, 'cause you're too busy trying to stop the next&#8230;terrible thing from happening. Seriously, if it wasn't for the Replicators, and their&#8230;plan to wipe out every human in the galaxy, I'd be in pretty bad shape right now. No, this is Carson all over again, and I'm just not ready to deal. Not yet.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to type on his keyboard again.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You're not the only one who misses them, Rodney. I don't suppose you want to talk about it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eventually, but not now.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka sighs and stands up.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. Oh, shall I get you anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Radek&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka pauses.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You're welcome, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves McKay alone.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay continues to work in his lab alone. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why don't you call it a night?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I uh, I want to finish this. What about you? Isn't it past your bedtime?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I approve the removal of her personal items tomorrow. Have everything shipped back to Earth. I would have done it sooner, but I actually thought we were going to&#8230;bring her back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Me, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let me know when you get this thing working.</blockquote>
<p>[He claps him on the shoulder as he starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Will do. Oh&#8230;wait!</blockquote>
<p>[He stares at the computer screen. Sheppard turns back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. If this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class Replicator ship in the galaxy in real time.</blockquote>
<p>[He types a few commands. A map of the galaxy appears on the monitor. A few red icons appear indicating ships.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that's not so bad. I guess the Wraith have really taken a toll.</blockquote>
<p>[Several more ships appear, each dot appearing with a beeping sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
On the other hand, my duplicate did say they were building more.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay stare at the screen with dawning fear as more ships fill the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A lot more.</blockquote>
<p><b>FADE OUT</b>
</p><p>[More beeps sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, crap.</blockquote>
