<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter walks with McKay, Keller, and Sheppard through the Gate Room and up to her office. Keller is dressed in off-world gear with a pack on her back. McKay and Sheppard also wear off-world gear, Sheppard sucks on a lollipop.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Which planet is this again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
M5V-801.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The one with the frequent tremors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not to mention an abnormally high amount of people with debilitating respiratory problems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissive)<br />
It's a mining planet. It's not that surprising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not everybody worked in the mines, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get to the point, guys.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're experiencing upwards of four tremors a day. My seismic team has concluded that the area where they've built their settlement is dangerously unstable. So&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Not to mention my environmental and air quality tests came back <i>way</i> into the red.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My analysis was enough, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(smirking)<br />
Well, obviously, it wasn't enough for them. Anyway, these people said they've experienced tremors for as long as they can remember.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, and I'm pretty sure they've been breathing even longer. So again, my problem trumps yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
This is not a contest! Obviously, they're living in a settlement that's not safe for habitation. You need to convince them to move to another part of the continent.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we tried. It's not working.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Twenty years ago, the Genii kind of took over the planet&#8212;employed them all as miners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Mining what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Haven't a clue. Whatever it was, they cleaned out the deposits and left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, they think we're like the Genii, and they want their cut.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
They're willing to move, but they have a list of demands a mile and a half long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And negotiating with alien settlements is not exactly why I joined the Air Force.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter half-quirks a wry smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We were hoping if you had some time, maybe you could come&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(talking over her)<br />
It would save us a lot of time in the back and forth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay. I'll free up my afternoon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Appreciate that, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. McKay and Keller start to follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Jennifer, Rodney&#8230;I'll meet you at the 'gate in one hour.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks startled, but nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;I was rather hoping you would go by yourself. And I would&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(firmly)<br />
One hour.</blockquote>
<p>[Chastened, McKay sighs and leaves.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M5V-801 FIELD, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Carter, Keller, and McKay walk across a fallow field, following a cart trail. Keller is breathing heavily.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(panting)<br />
Man&#8230;I gotta start doing more cardio. All this&#8230;back and forth is getting me winded. We couldn't have taken the jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(also slightly winded)<br />
Oh, suck it up. It's not that bad. I have to hike this much almost every day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(surprised)<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nodding)<br />
Yeah, I'm a very active person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(dubious)<br />
You are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(dubious)<br />
Your last physical would kind of contradict you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(piqued)<br />
That is private medical information that should not be so cavalierly shared in casual conversation, <i>Doctor</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller and Carter smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't think it comes as a great surprise to the Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's not the point! You know, I'm no Ronon. I'm not going to be on the cover of&#8230; <i>Shape</i> magazine anytime soon. But uh&#8230;I can handle myself in combat. Stand my ground when I need to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[A cracking sound under his feet can be heard an instant before he disappears from sight, falling into a hole.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to go to where he disappears, but Carter pulls her back.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Don't move.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay can be heard groaning down below.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Get down on your stomach. Spread out your wait.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Keller crawl on their bellies towards the opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney? McKay, are you all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Visible at the bottom of the hole, McKay lies on his back. He shifts one arm and moves his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(under her breath)<br />
Oh, thank God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Don't move, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
Not a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We're gonna head back to the 'gate. Try to get some help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Just-just try to stay as still&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[More of the ground gives way sending Keller and Carter crashing into the hole, one screaming as they fall.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Keller, McKay, and Carter lie amongst the debris from the collapsed ceiling. They groan and try and sit up. Around them are the remains of an underground room, with beams, lamps, and wooden crates. There are roofs as if there are adjacent buildings, and doors as well.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(grunting)<br />
Don't move if you feel any shooting pains.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I would never move if that was the case. Ah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(groaning)<br />
Ow. Well, it doesn't look like any of us are bleeding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(groaning)<br />
At least externally.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That's a godsend.</blockquote>
<p>[They grunt and groan as they get to their feet and look around.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This whole place is a tetanus shot waiting to happen. In fact&#8230;where the hell are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pointing to the Genii insignia on the wall)<br />
I'd guess the Genii mining facility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Just don't build 'em like they used to, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm particularly not fond of the ceiling work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
If this is part of a larger facility&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Then there should be a way for us to walk out of here. Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter walks over to a blue door on one side of the room and starts to try to open it. McKay wanders over to a red door. He starts to touch the wheel to open it.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Little help here.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks over, surprised.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What about this one?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller is already helping Carter with the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well&#8230;red means bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Can't argue with that logic.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay joins the others who are pulling on the door. He studies a keypad next to the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, did you see this? That's not going to budge unless we enter the right code. Look, these symbols are Genii numerals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, but&#8230;you can crack the code, though, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(as McKay speaks)<br />
Well, it would be a lot easier&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Carter speaks)<br />
Yeah, it'd be a lot easier&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER AND MCKAY<br />
&#8230;if it was electronic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What he said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What she said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's not impossible, though, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No&#8230;no. It's just&#8230;highly, highly unlikely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay. So&#8230;door number two?</blockquote>
<p>[She points to the red door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Carter)<br />
After you, Monty.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk over to the other door.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay&#8230;on three. One&#8230;two&#8230;three.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay try to turn to wheel, but it doesn't budge.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There goes that plan.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter spots a thin metal rod on the floor nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</blockquote>
<p>[They place the rod in the wheel to act a lever.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay&#8230;one, two, three&#8230;go!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay are able to move the wheel a bit.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What if&#8230;what if that door was&#8230;sealed for a reason?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(patronizing)<br />
What, you think maybe there's a scary monster back there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No. But this is a mining facility, and who knows what kind of toxins are in there. Like you said: "Red means bad."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well&#8230;<br />
(shrugging)<br />
I'm willing to take the chance.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay push open the door, which opens outwards. McKay holds Carter back before she falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Whoa.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare out into a deep chasm. Other chambers are on the far side, held up by metal girders. A catwalk that bridged the chasm between their chamber and the others has fallen apart, and there is nothing on the other side of the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I guess in Genii, red means "screwed."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[They close the door. Carter checks her watch. McKay goes over to study the Genii keypad again.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay, look. It's&#8230;we've been in the field for what, half an hour? We've got another five before we need to check in. So, the safest thing for us to do is just sit tight and wait. When we don't check in, they'll send a team. Our radios should work down here, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, they should.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter checks out an empty metal cabinet.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay. So, we&#8230;we sit and wait.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller sits.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to pry open the keypad control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Anyone, uh&#8230;bring any cards?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(chuckling)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[A loud rumbling shakes the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Tremor!</blockquote>
<p>[They try to take cover against the walls of the room as it sways. Eventually, the shaking stops, after a lot of metallic groaning.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That sounded very, very bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Uh, what do you suppose the probability is that this room is on the same kind of metal stilts as those other rooms we saw over there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Very high.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
But&#8230;this one's more stable, right? I mean, we're till standing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, but with the three of us and this dirt, we've just added what? Three-four hundred pounds?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;I'd say like five hundred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Right. And this region experiences how many tremors a day?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Four times a day at least.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sighs heavily.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What is it? What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The supports that are stopping this room from dropping into the chasm are going to rapidly destabilize now that we've added all this extra weight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think we're going to be able to just wait for Atlantis to figure out we're missing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You're right. We're gonna have to find a way out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay look at the ceiling. Keller walks around a bit.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well&#8230;there are a lot of&#8230;lot of crates in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Rickety old ones. I killed like, three of them on my way down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, but maybe we could make, like, a pyramid. Stack them up. Climb out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think there's enough to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Uh, there are, actually. Just barely enough to get us high enough, but we should be able to make it work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You think they'll support our weight?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Only one way to find out.</blockquote>
<p>[They work together to start pushing the crates.]
</p><p>[Later, Keller is using a piece of metal sheeting to sweep as much of the dirt and unnecessary debris as she can out the red door into the chasm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, look&#8230;if we're actually going to do this, I figure we need to stack these things, like, twenty feet high in order to climb out. So no matter how we build it, it's going to be unstable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well&#8230;only one person has to climb it.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shuts the red door and joins them. They look at her. Her eyes widen.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh. No, I-I'm kind of awful with heights, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, Sam goes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(surprised)<br />
What, you're not even going to consider yourself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It-it's heights! I'm probably worse than she is!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter makes a face, resigned then starts to climb on the boxes.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Let's get started.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay watches protectively as she clambers up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, fine.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller and McKay pass boxes up to Carter, who keeps stacking them. The wood creaks ominously and they all freeze, wide-eyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(gesturing)<br />
Maybe&#8230;maybe you should come down from there. It-it-it sounds like it's&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[There is more creaking. Carter cautiously climbs onto the box. She looks up to the light just outside her grasp. The bottom box shatters, sending the ones on top and Carter tumbling onto the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sam!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Keller rush over to her as she groans and tries to move.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Easy, easy. You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is she all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sits up, clutching her side.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(groaning)<br />
That was fun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, the bottom level won't hold. The crates aren't strong enough to stack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The whole room shakes again from another tremor.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So&#8230;we need another plan. And quick.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHASM</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING FACILITY</b>
</p><p>[The trio scavenge the closets. Keller finds an accordion file.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hey, I got some files here. Can anyone read Genii?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello, hello.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay holds up his file from another closet.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What have you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Grappling hook. Or at least, something we can use as a grappling hook.</blockquote>
<p>[He plunks down a small metal device that has a four pronged hooks on either end.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Great! Now all we need is some rope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, just a sec&#8212;the ceiling is like, what, twenty feet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Twenty-five?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, twenty-five. So, our jackets end to end are five or six feet&#8230;tie those to our shirts, maybe even our pants together&#8230;that should be able to get us up there and support our weight.</blockquote>
<p>[While McKay has been speaking, Carter moves to another metal cabinet in the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts trying to remove one of the hooks. Keller takes off her jacket and throws it by him. He glances up to see her about to strip off her t-shirt. She has it pulled to bra level when&#8230;]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Found rope!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter holds up a rope. Keller smiles triumphantly while pulling her shirt back down. McKay looks disappointed.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rope and lanterns.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(without enthusiasm)<br />
Oh good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
More than enough for what we need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(still flatly)<br />
Well, nice work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sets the rope down and tries to find both ends. McKay picks up one end and starts to tie it to the grappling hook.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm going to tie the rope on and toss it up there so you can climb up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I can't do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chiding)<br />
Hey, quitter talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No, I can't climb <i>this</i>. This rope&#8212;it's too thin. We need to tie knots in it. I need something to grip onto.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. That's a lot of knots.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, we only need about&#8230;thirty feet or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, well, you gals get started on the, uh, knotting, and, um, I'll read those files.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Keller both look affronted.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Look, they could contain the code to the door, there. Besides, three people can't knot the same rope. Unless either of you speak Genii.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(piqued)<br />
Fine. We'll get started.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, want to play twenty questions? I'll let you go first. Animal, vegetable, or mineral?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'm good. Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sighing)<br />
Well, here's a better one we can play. Brad Pitt or George Clooney?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks at her blankly, then begins to consider.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
If you had to choose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Mmm&#8230;Clooney, I guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(pointing to herself)<br />
Pitt all the way. Okay, you go. Come on, it's easy. Any two guys I would know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay, okay. Un&#8230;Brian Greene or Neil Degrasse Tyson?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller stares at Carter with a blank look.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
They're physicists.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
They're on t.v. I picked ones you should know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Uh&#8230;Brian Greene, I guess?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(shaking her head)<br />
Pfft&#8230;Tyson, all the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you talking about Neil Degrasse Tyson? He once stole an idea from me. Did I  tell you that story?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Only about a dozen times, McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns back to his reading.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We're playing "Who would you rather&#8230;?" Want to join us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;"would you&#8212;" Sorry, I don't get it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, if you had to choose who to fool around with, would it be&#8230;Robert Redford or Paul Newman?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(vaguely disturbed)<br />
Uh&#8230;neither?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, I know. But if you had to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If I had to? So, I'm to choose which one of those guys I would want to force themselves on me because&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(challenging)<br />
It's just a dumb game, McKay. You're not secure enough in your masculinity to play a dumb game?</blockquote>
<p>[She and Carter exchange amused looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, yes, well I think I am. I just&#8230;I think I should go back to my reading. You know, the one thing that could get us out of here?</blockquote>
<p>[He turns away, but looks up as if hearing something above.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Newman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Absolutely. Not even a question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Shut up a sec.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No! We're allowed to talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. I hear something.</blockquote>
<p>[They listen and can hear faint voices and movement above.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's someone up there.<br />
(calling out)<br />
Help! We're stuck down here! Hello?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What if the ceiling caves in on them too?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we came through that section. It's been eaten away by rust. The rest of the ceiling looks fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
He's right. As long as they don't fall in the hole, they should be able to get help.<br />
(calling out)<br />
Hello!?</blockquote>
<p>[The laughing voices sound closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Help! We're stuck down here! Can you hear us!</blockquote>
<p>[Two young boys appear in the opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, thank god.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY TWO<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We're visitors! We were on our way to speak to the people of your settlement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
You shouldn't be down there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, we know. We fell down here by accident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY TWO<br />
You all okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, yeah, we're fine. We're just stuck. We need some help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
You shouldn't be down there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Yeah, thanks, kid. Like I said&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter grabs his arm to interrupt.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Go tell your parents! Tell them where we are&#8212;that we're stuck, and we need help.</blockquote>
<p>[The boys exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY TWO<br />
I don't think we can do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
We're not really supposed to play out here. If our parents find out&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's okay. I promise you won't get into trouble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
You don't know my father. He'll be very upset.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'll explain the situation to him. It'll be okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Please? We're&#8230;hurt. We need help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY TWO<br />
(accusing)<br />
Wait a minute, he said you were all okay. I asked him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(angrily)<br />
All right, listen to me you little brats! I am older than you, and I am in charge!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Rodney. Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller tries to tug on him and calm him down. He ignores her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You will go back to your parents! You will tell them we need help! Or so help me&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter grabs his arm and interrupts.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Do you need something?! Anything? We can get it for you. If you help us, we can get you whatever you want.</blockquote>
<p>[The boys' eyes widen and they start whispering amongst themselves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Carter)<br />
Oh, yes. Good. Great idea. Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe you can show them your um&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gestures to his chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(offended)<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was once a ten year old boy too. I know what gets their attention.</blockquote>
<p>[He raises his fists and looks up as if mimicking how Carter should lift her shirt. Carter continues to glare at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Do you want to get out of here or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I think we can reason with them without resorting to that, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing, dubious)<br />
If you say so.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to Keller hopefully, who glares at him, then pointedly ignores him by looking back up at the boys and shaking her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
We gotta go now. Bye!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No! Wait, wait, wait, wait!</blockquote>
<p>[The boys disappear. One drops his head back into the opening briefly.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
Uh&#8230;good luck!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Would it have killed you to show 'em&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Drop it, McKay! It's not gonna happen.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs. Carter looks at her watch.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Four hours and fifty minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm warning you&#8212;I mean, I could go crazy down here. Ever since the whole jumper thing a couple of years ago, I've been very bad in tight spaces.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Please. That's nothing. I was stuck in a transporter with <i>Zelenka</i> for three hours. Now, <i>that's</i> hard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a second, what-what are you saying? You don't like Zelenka?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(backpedaling)<br />
No, I just&#8230;It-it was more claustrophobic than this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but that's not what you said. You-you emphasized Zelenka. You said, "being stuck with <i>Zelenka</i> for three hours", like that was the hard part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(apologetically)<br />
It did kind of sound that way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Look&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can say you don't like him. It's fine! I don't like him.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller chuckles and makes a face.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, he's certainly a unique guy. He's always telling me how nice my&#8230;hair smells. It's a little weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
He's a very good person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, yeah, sure, sure, sure. He's the best. You just don't like him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I did not say that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you didn't have to. I know which one's your favorite now.</blockquote>
<p>[He points to himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's not a contest!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everything is a contest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(angrily)<br />
Don't you have some reading to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's nothing in there. Certainly nothing about the&#8230;door code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Back to knotting.</blockquote>
<p>[After several rounds of knotting.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Steve Carrell or Stephen Colbert?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh&#8230;Colbert I think.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carrell&#8230;but I would pick Jon Stewart over both of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hmph.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quickly)<br />
If I was forced to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter smiles and nods knowingly.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Are you and Katie still, um&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
Oh, uh&#8230;well, it-it's kind of messed up now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Why, what happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I was going to&#8230;propose. Uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(shocked)<br />
You were?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. I bought her a ring and everything. You know, was going to&#8230;ask her, and then the, uh, quarantine error happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What does that have to do with anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I don't particularly want to go into the details, but uh, you know, I just, I told her that I needed some time for me. Not, you know, it had nothing to do with her. I just-I just needed to figure some stuff out. And now she doesn't want to speak to me. She's filed for a transfer back to Earth&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You broke up with her. That's a break-up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I didn't!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(confused)<br />
No, I-I said I needed the time for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, code for "I'm not that into you anymore."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But I meant it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It doesn't matter! You can't "almost" propose to someone and then take it back! That's a relationship killer.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks to Carter, who shrugs in agreement with Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sadly)<br />
Oh. Oh, I suppose it was for the best. I mean, she deserves to be with someone who would've known that.</blockquote>
<p>[He chuckles self-consciously. Keller smiles in sympathy.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What she deserves is to be with a nice guy, like you.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay smiles at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks at the rope.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We're finished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oooh! Finally! Right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grabs the rope and hook from Carter before she can stop him.]
</p><p>[Carter and Keller move a couple crates away. McKay gets ready to throw the hook upward.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
(from a distance)<br />
Yeah, over here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You guys hear that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's the kids! They've come back for us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I knew they were good kids. I knew it!<br />
(calling out)<br />
Down here! I knew you'd come back! Guys!</blockquote>
<p>[The two boys appear with two more boys.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY THREE<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
See? I told you they were down there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Are your parents up there? Did you bring help?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY TWO<br />
No. Our friends didn't believe us. We bet them a week's supply of taffle that we were telling the truth.</blockquote>
<p>[He elbows Boy one.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOY THREE<br />
See? I told you not to!</blockquote>
<p>[The new boys look disappointed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are the adults?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY ONE<br />
We can't tell them! We'll get in trouble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(furious)<br />
Trouble?! Now, you wait 'til I get out of here you little brats. I'll show you what trouble is!</blockquote>
<p>[The boys run away. There is another tremor, the biggest one so far.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Tremor! We're moving!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[The girders holding up their chamber buckle somewhat.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING FACILITY CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We're tilting over!</blockquote>
<p>[The tremor ends, but the room is now tilted at a thirty degree angle.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It stopped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The superstructure under this room must have buckled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
One more tremor&#8230;this whole chamber's going to fall into the chasm.</blockquote>
<p>[They stand at odd angles in the tilted room, looking upward.]
</p><p>[Later, Carter and Keller finish hanging lanterns in the room, as Carter notices McKay starting to swing the hook awkwardly.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nervously)<br />
Uh, do you want me to do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nope. I can do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Uh, well, it's just&#8230;have you ever done anything like this before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
What, like you have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yes, actually. I have a bunch of times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with bravado)<br />
Yeah, well, I mean, so have I. You know, missions and such.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(resigned)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks away. Keller still stands staring at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You should probably&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures where Carter is moving.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, right.</blockquote>
<p>[She joins Carter at the far end of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay swings the rope around several times and releases it. The rope shoots directly towards Carter, who ducks as it sparks as it hits the metal wall behind her.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sorry! Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You just about took my head off!</blockquote>
<p>[She picks up the hook.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but I didn't mean to. It slipped.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter walks over with the hook. McKay reaches for it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let me do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(low, stern)<br />
Apparently, you can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low)<br />
I can do it! Just don't stand in front of me&#8230;or behind me.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter lets go, and she and Keller move behind some crates.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay! Okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a deep breath and tosses the hook up. It doesn't go high enough and clatters back down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See? Almost there.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods encouragingly as Carter watches patiently.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You'll get it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls the hook away from where it embedded in a pipe in the floor. He doesn't notice the hole in the pipe or the gas escaping as he pulls it free.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You can do this. This is the one. I can feel it. This is the one.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay swings and throws the hook. This time it almost makes it before coming back down. The spark it makes as it lands ignites the gas, causing a fire and a blast wave that knocks McKay down. Carter hurries to the pipe and the nearby shutoff valve.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Stay there!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter tries to grasp the valve but it's too hot. She uses her jacket sleeves as protection as she turns the valve closed. Without fuel, the fire burns out. Keller heads for McKay, who's getting to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Anything hurt?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, it's just my pride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(comforting him)<br />
That'll heal.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter grabs the hook and expertly spins and tosses it up. It hooks onto something on the ground above.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You did it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(flatly)<br />
Oh, great.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter pulls on the rope to check how secure the line is. It doesn't give.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right. Here goes nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[As soon as she puts her full weight on the rope. The loose soil comes tumbling into the hole along with the rope. Carter dives for cover.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Aw, nuts.</blockquote>
<p>[She tries again, but the same thing happens.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
There's no way the hook can grab onto that soil.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(disappointed)<br />
All those knots&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, we had to try. Any other ideas?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks up at the ceiling where the lamps are hanging. He snaps his fingers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See those beams up there? We use the rope to get up there. That buys us at least ten feet. Then, we build a bridge, a bridge using&#8230; Using these.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls over some wooden planks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Stack a couple of crates, we're golden. We got that high before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, but I don't think these are long enough to span the distance between these two beams.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So we&#8230;find a hammer and nails.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Sure. Why not just add a jet-pack and a trampoline to that list.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is possible to find a hammer and nails.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to rummage the cupboards.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We've been over the room pretty thoroughly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whining)<br />
But there's gotta be hammer and nails!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, even if we found them&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, we just have to build a bridge.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare at the boards.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(inspired)<br />
Wait a second. Wait a second. That bar bet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(blankly)<br />
Sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That dumb trick you do to get free beer.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay exchange baffled looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We-we don't know what you're talking about.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller demonstrates on a crate with three mess kit knives and metal cups set upon it.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Bet goes like this. Using these three knives, and without moving these three cups, you need to build a bridge that can support another cup's weight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We don't have another cup.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Whatever. We'll use these.</blockquote>
<p>[She picks up a large roll of gauze tape.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. Now&#8230;see? Just like our boards&#8230;just a little too short to span the space between the two beams there.</blockquote>
<p>[She demonstrates how the knife can't reach fully to the other cup. A faint tremor rumbles in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you know what? We're geniuses, we could probably figure it out, but, uh,  a little under the gun, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller quickly lines up the three knives to each partially span the distance from each cup. The intersection of the knives forms a solid bridge, able to easily support the tape. Carter and McKay instantly move to the boards and study the beams to apply the principles.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You owe me a beer, by the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, if this works, I'll buy you a keg.</blockquote>
<p>[They use the rope to lever one board over the beam, Carter guiding the effort. As they continue to work, each of them ends up on a beam, working to intersect the boards. Finally, they're all in place. Carter tests its strength at the edge. It creaks, but holds her easily. McKay shoves up a crate. Carter and Keller move it into place on the center of the 3-piece bridge. When two crates are there, it's high enough for someone to reach the opening. Carter climbs onto the crates, but they creak dangerously.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(worried)<br />
I knew this wasn't such a good idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried, from the ground below)<br />
Listen, I know I have a reputation for being overly pessimistic, but I really think you should come down <i>right now</i> before it all collapses.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter continues to climb.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sam. Sam, just head back.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter is able to touch the edge of the opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'm almost there.</blockquote>
<p>[There is another tremor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh no!</blockquote>
<p>[The shifting is enough to knock the boards out of sync. Carter and the crates fall all the way down.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Whoa!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Sam!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter lies on the ground, trying to clutch her leg. McKay rushes to her side.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't move! Don't move!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller clambers down from the beam as Carter groans in pain. Keller starts to examine her, but when she touches Carter's right leg, Carter screams in agony. Keller and McKay exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Your leg is broken.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(gritting her teeth in pain)<br />
Oh! We're in trouble now, aren't we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(without conviction)<br />
No, we'll be fine. We just, uh&#8230;we'll be fine.</blockquote>
<p>[A bit later, Keller comes back with her medical kit. Carter's trouser leg is pulled up to above her knee.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Okay. Can you help me? Okay. One hand here, on her knee.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
One hand down here, on her ankle. Keep it nice and straight.<br />
(to Carter)<br />
You're not going to like this, but I gotta take your boot off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(with difficulty)<br />
Yeah, I thought you might.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller unlaces the boot while Carter braces herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. Here it comes.</blockquote>
<p>[She tugs the boot off while McKay holds the leg. Carter winces.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Agh!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller quickly pulls off Carter's sock.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. Tell me when you can feel my finger on the bottom of your foot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller starts to touch parts of Carter's foot.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yep&#8230;Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller reaches around and finds a small piece of wood from the broken crate.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(to McKay)<br />
We need to find another one of these&#8212;make a splint.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[They both move away from Carter to search the room. McKay confronts Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look. How bad is she?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, it's not so bad. She still has feeling in her foot, so there doesn't seem to be any nerve damage. But the break's pretty severe, which means there may very well be internal bleeding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but that's&#8212;I mean, that's&#8230;bad, isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, it's not really good, no. I mean&#8230;I would need to get her under a scanner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, worst case scenario. She's bleeding internally. How long has she got before she&#8230;before it becomes very serious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
An hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, boy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes her found board and heads back over to Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So, what? Hour before internal bleeding becomes a problem?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks at McKay, who looks stunned.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How did you..?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's not my first rodeo, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Here's some ibuprofen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(aghast)<br />
Ibuprofen?! That's the strongest thing you've got?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's all I have in this basic kit. Although, from this point on, I think I'm making morphine mandatory&#8230;as well as maybe a grappling gun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I wouldn't take the morphine. Got to keep a clear head. We still have to figure a way out of here&#8230;<br />
(hisses)<br />
At least one of us does. Chances are pretty slim that I'm going to&#8230;climb out. Ow.</blockquote>
<p>[She winces as Keller sets the leg.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well the crates are out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Keller)<br />
Hey, if you got an idea, feel free.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hey, I came up with the bar trick thing, okay? And that didn't work out so well, so I think I'll just&#8230;leave it to the pros.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks to Carter hopefully, who's fighting back tears.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Sorry. All my energy's focused on not screaming in agony.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wonderful.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller gets up to find something to pillow Carter's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Well, the grappling hook because the hook wouldn't hold our weight in the soil. The crates didn't work because Sam was too heavy, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(backpedaling)<br />
Oh&#8230;we all would've been. I mean&#8230;our weight in general. It had nothing to do with you. It just&#8230;you&#8230;I mean, you're in very good shape. Seriously, you have, like the perfect body.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller returns to Carter's side with some blankets she rolls up, and glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh! Not that you don't! Oh, no, no, no. I realize that your bodies are different, and-and-and, uh maybe-maybe that that would mean that I think that your body is imperfect, but that is not the case. No, no, no. Far, far-far from it&#8212;that&#8212;that is, a sweet&#8230;uh, which is to say&#8230;I mean, it would be impossible for me to choose which of you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(annoyed, and pained)<br />
Rest assured, you're never gonna have to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(drily)<br />
Aw, if we'd kept quiet, I bet he would've gone on like that forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I'm sorry. What I mean is-is that you have&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sternly)<br />
Rodney. Stay on topic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. Okay, uh, right&#8230;where was I? Uh&#8230;All right, look&#8230;if we can get this rod up there, attach the rope to it, it'll lay across the hole&#8212;support our weight. We won't have to worry about the soil.</blockquote>
<p>[He shows a long thin metal piece of rebar.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(dubious)<br />
You were barely able to get the grappling hook up there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Barely? Were you not watching? It was&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(interrupting)<br />
It's just that&#8230;it's a lot heavier than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks around and spots the pipe that had the gas fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(inspired)<br />
A detonator. I need a detonator.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, McKay begins setting up pieces of the pipe like a cannon, placing a detonator inside and activating it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just place the detonator inside the tube&#8230;Now&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He moves the heavy piece over to the other pipe, where Keller has been working with some wet wadded up cloth over the broken part of the leak. They place the detonator pipe at an angle over the cloth.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We have to seal the bottom of the tube around the gas leak, like so&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[While Keller holds up the heavy pipe, McKay puts more cloth around where the two pipes meet.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, so, put the wadding and the rod in the barrel&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Keller finishes stuffing the "cannon" with more cloth. The cannon is now tied to the pipe with the climbing rope. McKay stuffs in the rod, which has a thin small rope attached to it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And then, "gently" create a seal. We don't want to pack it too tight, otherwise we've got ourselves a pipe bomb. But, if we play it right, our very own cannon.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller starts stuffing more wadding inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You really think this is going to work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It should.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(skeptical)<br />
You can build a cannon just like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Please, we've got access to pressurized gas. It's a cinch. You should have seen my Grade Six science project. I actually had to create&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter rolls her eyes from where she's barely sitting up at the far wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(chiding weakly)<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(contrite)<br />
Right. Okay. Yeah. So&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes position next to the cannon. Keller holds the cannon steady.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ready?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods. McKay opens the valve. After several few seconds, he closes it again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, okay. And&#8230;are we ready?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shakes her head, then nods, looking scared.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nervously)<br />
Ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fire in the hole.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay fires the detonator, wincing. The cannon shoots the rod straight up through the hole into the sky above.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nice aim!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Nice cannon.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay unties the end of the rope from where it's attached to a crate. There is barely any slack.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That went really far.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts pulling back the rope. Some dirt starts falling into the hole. They duck as more falls in.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Uh, McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Aah!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You should stop. There's too much dirt coming in. The room's going to get too heavy!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've almost got it!</blockquote>
<p>[As McKay pulls, there is another tremor. They try to keep their footing.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[One of the girders totally gives way, angling the precarious chamber even more. The door flies open and Keller falls. She grabs onto the rope as she falls out of the room, clinging to it as she swings over the abyss below with a scream.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay has hold of one end of the rope, wrapped around his arm. He's holding on, taking all the weight as he slides into one of the beams in the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Jennifer!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Keller swings several feet below the chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Down here! Rodney, don't let go!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay renews his efforts to keep hold. The angle of the room is now much steeper.]
</p><p>[Carter struggles over to the door to find Keller, who is nearly sobbing below.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINING CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter is able to peek over the edge and see Keller swinging below.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Rodney, don't let go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(straining)<br />
Sam, I can't hold this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yes, you can!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
No, no. I've never been very good at holding heavy things. I had an old lady's grocery cart when I was in college. It's one of the reasons I didn't date as much as I should have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(rolling her eyes)<br />
Stay focused! You need to pull her up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
Oh, really? I was just-just getting used to the idea of not letting go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
She can't hang there forever, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, help me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney, I can't help you. I can't even stand up. You're going to have to pull her up on your own.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay backs away from the beam, trying to get into position to pull. He is able to pull her up a few inches.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINING CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Keller yelps as the rope shifts.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay continues to pull, grunting.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINING CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Keller, spinning as she moves, spots a light to the left of the chamber further down the chasm.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Don't pull me up!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
What?! Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I see light!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
No, no, no, no! Don't go towards the light! You want to stay in the land of the living!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINING CHASM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No, daylight! There's a-there's a mine shaft down here! I see daylight!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Of course! Just like the ones on the other side of the mine. We should've thought of that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(straining)<br />
Okay, guys, what do you want me to do?! What do I do?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Lower me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wha&#8212;Lower you?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's about ten feet away. I just-I just need to swing over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What if the mine shaft is harder to get out of than this chamber?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We already lost our exit, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks up. The shifting angle of the mine chamber has now blocked the hole. Solid dirt is above them now.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'll take my chances! Just lower me! I can't hold on forever!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grunting)<br />
You and me both.</blockquote>
<p>[He slowly lowers her.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Keller is lowered to a point even with the shaft opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, good, stop!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Gladly!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter watches as Keller starts a controlled swing over to the shaft opening.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You're doing great, Rodney. You're doing just great!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, "great" is a beach with a fiber-optic hook-up. This, this is complete agony!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Keller is able to gain a foothold at the chasm. She grabs hold of the wall with one arm and with effort gets steady footing at the shaft.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay falls on his back as he suddenly has no pressure at the other end of the rope.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I made it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You could have warned me.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Keller moves into the shaft a ways and looks up. She comes back to the opening to call up.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This thing leads straight out! It's a nice steady slope! C'mon, you guys gotta get down here!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Carter slides back to the door and nods to McKay, who is holding his hands away from his body.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What? No way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
There's no way I'm going to be able to lower myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You won't have to. I-I'll lower you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney, your hands&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Panting, McKay looks down at his trembling hands. They are covered with blood from holding the rope.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I'm not leaving you behind. Come on&#8230;I'll make you a seat.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter sits on a board that's been attached to the rope. She's being lowered down. Over her arm is coiled the bottom half of the rope.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay has wound the rope around a couple of the beams as makeshift pulleys to help control the rope's descent.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter continues to be lowered. The jerking movement jars her injured leg.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay winces in pain as his hands continue to lower the rope. He's got them wrapped in the cloth, but it's not much protection.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter is even with the shaft opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay, that's good. Stop!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Stopping!</blockquote>
<p>[He grips the rope to try and keep her steady.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter tosses the coiled rope to Keller who catches it and starts to reel her over.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. Almost there. Just give me a few more feet of slack!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter, in pain, tries to grasp the wall as she nears to help Keller get her in.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay slowly lets the rope down more.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter is able to sit in the mine and Keller has a good hold on her shoulder, certain she won't fall into the shaft.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, I got her!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[McKay sighs in relief and lets go of the rope, standing at an angle to remain upright.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[Carter looks exhausted and pained.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're up, McKay!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII MINING CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, great. Great. You know what I was just thinking? What would be awesome? Would be more physical exertion!</blockquote>
<p>[He bows his head as he tries to catch his breath.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE CHASM</b>
</p><p>[McKay is on the rope and hanging even with the shaft opening, but remains still, with his back to the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come on now. Start swinging.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay doesn't move.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Rodney, you have to use your body and start swinging. Come on. You're so close!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shivering)<br />
No. Used everything I got to get this far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So that's it, then? You-you're quitting? You're just going to die there on the rope?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(firmly)<br />
No. No, I'm just taking a little rest.</blockquote>
<p>[Grimacing, he starts to swing a little. The rope starts to fray where it rubs against the broken opening of the mining chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mumbling)<br />
You know, I'm like&#8230;like a real life action star, kind of&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(exhausted)<br />
You know, shooting guns&#8230;running around&#8230;saving people. You'd think it'd be&#8230;you'd think this would be easy for me by now. You think I'd be, like, super-buff by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, come on, Schwarzenegger, start swingin'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just a second more.</blockquote>
<p>[There is an ominous groaning from the chamber girders.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, break's over.</blockquote>
<p>[Panting, he starts to swing back and forth. After two tries, he tries to reach, but it's not enough. Unbeknownst to them, the rope continues to fray, now faster. Finally, McKay is able to grab Keller's arm. She pulls him in just as the rope snaps. They both fall into the shaft at the lack of tension.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(breathless)<br />
That was close.</blockquote>
<p>[There is a loud rumbling. The entire mining chamber they had been trapped in passes by and falls into the chasm far below with a loud crunch.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Correction&#8230;<i>that</i> was close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nodding)<br />
Okay. Come on. You need to help me.</blockquote>
<p>[They both move toward Carter.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DUSK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Keller sit next to each other on an infirmary bed, now cleaned and in clean uniforms. Keller's hands are bandaged and she's looking over another staff person's chart. McKay is still having his hands tended to by a doctor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(to staff member)<br />
Looks good. Okay, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How's Sam?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(smiling)<br />
She's going to be okay. It's a clean break, so they're resetting it and putting her into a cast, which means she's going to be on crutches for a few weeks or so, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The doctor working on McKay finishes and pats him reassuringly on the arm before leaving.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(to doctor)<br />
Thank you.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
&#8212;She's going to be fine. How are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'd like to take a bath in whatever magical ointment they just put on my hands, 'cause they are the only thing that doesn't hurt. It's not going to scar, is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Chicks dig scars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not the chicks I dig.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're going to be fine.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Thanks, by the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
For what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You saved my life. If you had let go&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(embarrassed)<br />
Ah, you're welcome.<br />
(takes deep breath)<br />
Right, well, I'm going back to my room, curling up in the fetal position, and sleeping for the next three days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, well, not quite yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You owe me a beer&#8230;from the bar trick thing earlier. You couldn't figure it out, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
There was no time! I would've figured it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, well eventually, I mean, chimps would have been able to figure it out. But the thing is, you didn't. So I win, and you owe me a beer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
I don't remember ever agreeing to the beer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(impatient)<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Do you want to have a drink with me or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh&#8230;you-you want to have to have a drink?</blockquote>
<p>[He stares at her bemused as he realizes the implications.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(amused)<br />
God, you're not very good at this, are you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, no. No, I'm not.</blockquote>
<p>[She laughs and hops off the bed, grabbing his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay smiles as they walk out.]
