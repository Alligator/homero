<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[A disoriented McKay sits on a stool in front of a table with a laptop computer. He panics when he realizes his left hand has been tied to the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! Hey is anyone there?! Look, I need some help in here!</blockquote>
<p>[He struggles with the binding, then notices a post-it note on the tablet computer. It points to a button on the machine with the words "Press Here". He presses the button and a video appears showing a close up of McKay's face.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(recorded video)<br />
All right, look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that. You need to focus! I'm sure you're wondering&#8230;who tied you to the desk. Well, the truth is&#8230;it was you. I mean&#8230;me. I did it because I needed you to get this message. It would take too long to give you the full explanation, and you wouldn't remember it anyway, so you're just gonna have to just trust me on this. Now, you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair. Find it and cut yourself loose.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay finds the knife and cuts off the plastic restraint.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(recorded video)<br />
Now&#8230;I need you to listen. It is vitally important that you find this woman.</blockquote>
<p>[The video display moves to show a monitor displaying a file photograph of Teyla. Over the picture is written: "THIS IS TEYLA. FIND HER". Underneath is displayed "Teyla Emmagan&#8212;Athosian". The camera moves again to show McKay. McKay watches the recording of himself while rubbing his face, looking confused and afraid.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(recorded video)<br />
I don't know where she is, but you have to find her. She can help. Uh, check the mess hall, or maybe they took her to the brig. I don't know. You just have to keep looking. Don't worry about anything else. And for god's sake, don't trust anyone. Just find her, and do it fast, because if you don't, hundreds of people are going to die, including you.</blockquote>
<p>[The recording shuts off and the monitor now displays the picture of Teyla.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay wanders into the plant-filled room, clearly looking for someone.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Katie?</blockquote>
<p>[Katie turns from where she is working on some plants and approaches him.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(brightly)<br />
Rodney! Hey, what are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I heard you were back, and I hadn't seen you for a while, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Yeah, I know. We didn't&#8212;we have this whole new mainland to explore, and I've been bringing back samples all week.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, I see. Anything interesting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Well, it's all pretty similar to what we found back on Lantia. We found a few new species.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh, which reminds me, I've got a surprise for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh?</blockquote>
<p>[Katie giggles as she goes over to one of the tables and picks up a small potted cactus and brings it over to McKay. She clears her throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Well, it doesn't have a name yet, but I'm thinking of calling it&#8230;Rodneyana Villosa&#8230;after you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Really? What&#8230;you can do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds the pot and starts to touch the plant.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Be careful! The bristles will pierce skin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Anyway, look, I wondered if I could&#8230;tear you away from this long enough for us to have some lunch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh! I would-I would love to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
But I think I'm coming down with something. I have a headache, and I've had a few dizzy spells, so I was thinking of going down to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unenthusiastic)<br />
Oh. Uh, well, I'll come&#8230; with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh, no, Rodney. You don't have to do that. I know how much you hate being around sick people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Oh. No. Really. It's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh, that is so sweet. Thanks!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
After you.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie walks out. McKay sets down the plant and wipes his hands on his jacket, then follows her.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Katie and McKay enter. Keller is on duty.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Doctor Brown! I see you've brought my Number One Patient.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Oh, no. We're not here for me this time. I'm here for her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh. Okay, well, what can I do for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
I've got this really bad headache that won't go away, and I-I feel kind of dizzy.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller starts checking her throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
When did you first notice it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Sometime this morning. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, because you're the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptoms, and the second person from the botany department.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller indicates a filled infirmary bed. The patient waves to Katie.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Gerald? Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Gerald Baxter. He's on my team. You've met him before.<br />
(sotto voce)<br />
He's got the bug collection?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, sure, right, yeah. No, I remember now. Hey.</blockquote>
<p>[He half-heartedly waves.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I'm gonna have to take some blood.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
You too, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
If there is something going around, you might've been exposed to it as well. Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs in disappointment. Katie rubs her head.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Carter briefs Sheppard as they walk through the area. She is in civilian clothes, while he wears his BDUs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Major Dorsey and his team just returned from M6R-214. They examined the debris field above the planet, and found the parts from one, possibly two replicator ships.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just a matter of time before the Wraith got organized and started hitting back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I suppose. They did defeat the Ancients, after all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The replicators may look like the Ancients, and they may use the same technology, but they're gonna be a lot tougher to put down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(over comm)<br />
Colonel Carter, come in please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(keying comm)<br />
Go ahead, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(over comm)<br />
I've got a situation developing. Be advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire infirmary level.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Sheppard exchange alarmed looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller walks through the infirmary, now crowded with staff and patients in various degrees of distress.]
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between Carter's and Keller's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(into comm)<br />
Eleven patients have shown up here in the last hour complaining of headaches and dizziness. Eight of them are from the survey team that just got back from the mainland.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Any idea what's wrong with them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I ran some blood tests and found a bacteria I've never seen before. I'm checking it against the Ancient database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you want us to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, first thing we need to do is isolate everyone that went to the mainland and have them report to Doctor Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(over comm)<br />
Will do. Keep us posted.</blockquote>
<p>[As the communication ends, a lab tech approaches Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>LAB TECH<br />
More test results. You and I are both infected. So is Doctor McKay. The good news is, the most advanced case is still only showing mild flu-like symptoms. Maybe it won't get any worse than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, let's hope so.</blockquote>
<p><b>FADE TO WHITE</b>
</p><p><b>PRESENT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay warily walks through the empty corridor. He carries the tablet computer in one hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[He turns a corner and sees a man sitting against a wall. He sighs in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Hey, hey wake up.</blockquote>
<p>[He jostles the man, who keels over, dead. Behind McKay, Zelenka appears. He brandishes a long thin rod as a weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I don't know.</blockquote>
<p>[He approaches Zelenka, who raises the rod like a bat.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay raises his hand in surrender.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You're not a soldier.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If you say so.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka lowers the rod and starts walking, motioning McKay to follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You should come with me. It's safer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No-no. Slow down. What's going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's the soldiers. They're after us. If they catch us, they'll take us away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Take us where? What soldiers? What is this place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(whispering)<br />
Shh! Will you shut up? The soldiers will hear us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shouting)<br />
What the hell is going on here?! Why can't I remember anything?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(soothingly)<br />
I don't know. No one can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No one can? You've seen others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. One or two others, apart from the soldiers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(turning on his computer)<br />
What about her? Was she there?</blockquote>
<p>[He shows Zelenka Teyla's picture.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have to find her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. It's important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Look, the soldiers probably have her by now, okay? C'mon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, can we ask them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Are you crazy? If the soldiers see you, they shoot you, they take you away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Again with the taking away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Look, you should come hide with me. It's safer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't. I have to keep looking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Fine. Suit yourself. If you get yourself killed, I don't care.</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries away, muttering in Czech. McKay stays put, looking lost.]
</p><p><b>TEN HOURS EARLIER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Personnel in hazmat suits treat the various patients. McKay follows Keller to her computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It started suddenly, and then it just&#8230;uh, it just stopped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. Well, I appreciate you telling me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aren't you going to do anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
To be honest, I don't see how it's relevant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's a new symptom. I thought it might be important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't see how "a tingling sensation in your knees" relates to this condition, especially since you're the only one experiencing it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but, so far. I'm just saying, we don't know anything about this disease.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Look, the best thing for you to do right now is try to relax, okay? And let me do my work.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks over her shoulder while she types. She stops, and McKay nervously wanders away. Keller sighs, rolling her eyes.]
</p><p>[In another part of the infirmary, Marie gives Katie a mug. Katie is in scrubs and on a bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Here you go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie sips her tea. Marie leaves and McKay arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(slightly hoarse)<br />
What did Doctor Keller say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, she's gonna, uh, take it into consideration, thanked me for my input, and, uh. How you doin?</blockquote>
<p>[Katie doesn't seem to know what to do with her mug. McKay notices and places it on the bedside table.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
I'm okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, Doctor Keller's got her team working pretty hard. I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff. I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie nods, but looks distracted and in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(concerned)<br />
Seriously, are you okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(sighing)<br />
It's&#8230;my headache. It's-it's getting worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, look, is there anything I can do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Could you, uh, ask the nurse to bring me some tea?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what's wrong with this one?</blockquote>
<p>[He picks up the mug.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh, yeah&#8230;right.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn at a clattering sound. One of the people wearing hazmat has collapsed. It is Marie. Keller rushes over and she and another aide help Marie up.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Marie? What's-what's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
I don't know. I just got really dizzy. Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks alarmed. Katie watches blankly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Sheppard are in the office.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
Are you telling us that the infection has breached hazmat protocol?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;KELLER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the two offices.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm not entirely sure. It's possible she could've been previously exposed, but that would mean it's already spread much farther among the general population than we thought. I've got off-duty medical personnel conducting random blood tests around the city just to get a sense of where we're at.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have we confirmed it came from the mainland?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, the plant and soil samples brought back by the botany department were negative, but it still seems like the mostly likely point of origin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What about the database?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I haven't found a match yet, but I'm still looking. There is one more thing. Since we have no idea what this disease does, or how it's spread, or even if our containment measures are having any effect, I recommend we suspend all Gate travel immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thank you, Doctor.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay eats a tray full of food at Katie's bedside. Katie wakes up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling)<br />
Hey! How you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
I, I-I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, well, they brought dinner. The salisbury steak's actually quite good. Oh, and by the way, I asked Doctor Keller about your friend Doctor Baxter. She says he's asleep, but apparently the fever's down.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie looks around bewildered.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Doctor Baxter? That's his name, right? The&#8230;guy on your team&#8230;? Katie?</blockquote>
<p>[Rodney becomes concerned as Katie continues to look around utterly confused.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Where am I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean? You're in the infirmary. I brought you here, remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at her in shock.]
</p><p><b>PRESENT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay continues to wander the halls. Lorne and a team of guards appear at the far end. Lorne spots McKay and raises his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Hey! Hold it right there!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns and raises his hand in surrender.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't want to cause any trouble, I just&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They stun him and he collapses to the floor, unconscious. His computer slides away in the fall. The group approaches, and Lorne checks him over.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Yeah, put him with the others. Go on. Get him out of here. C'mon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[The carry McKay away. Lorne pops a pill and hands one to one of his men as they follow. McKay's computer, still displaying Teyla's picture, remains unnoticed under a chair.]
</p><p><b>EIGHT HOURS EARLIER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what's the word?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, the random test results came back. Six different people working in six different areas of the city&#8212;all positive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that doesn't sound very promising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, it's either a statistical miracle, or the entire base has been exposed. We're running more tests to confirm it, but it doesn't look good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know about you, but I feel fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, me too. And that's the problem. If there is a delay before the first symptoms appear, it could've spread anywhere before we even knew what was happening. I've informed Stargate Command that we're suspending Gate operations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(over comm)<br />
Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between Keller's office to Carter and Sheppard.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown as well three other patients who are beginning to show signs of amnesia. All of them show large concentrations of affected cells in the medial temporal lobe. It looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to produce a hormone that interferes with the brain's ability to access episodic memory.</blockquote>
<p>[While Keller talks, Sheppard and Carter look at display in Carter's office, showing the test results. Sheppard and Carter exchange concerned looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How bad are we talking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, the rate of deterioration seems to vary from patient to patient. But in all cases, it looks like it's progressive&#8212;meaning, the longer they go without treatment, the worse it gets. Pretty soon, they won't be able to remember their own names.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You said the first symptoms were headaches and dizziness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, that's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How long after they appeared before the first signs of memory loss?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Again, it seems to vary, but you're looking at an average of about six hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How about you, Doc? Showin' any signs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, the headache started half an hour ago.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Sheppard both sigh.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right, keep searching the database. I still think it's our best bet to find a solution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'd&#8230;love to, but if we're right about these numbers, I'm about to get overrun with a lot of new patients. It's already pretty crowded in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mess hall. We can clear it out and make a temporary ward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, that's a good idea. At the very least, it'll consolidate everyone in one place for treatment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p><p><b>PRESENT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[McKay regains consciousness lying on a cot. He groans as he sits up. The mess hall is filled with confused people, including Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Where am I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We were hoping you could tell us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who are all you people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARINE<br />
We don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
None of us can remember anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
What's happening out there? What did you see?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nothing. It was just&#8230;empty hallways. How did I get here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
The soldiers brought you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEVES<br />
They-they bring everyone here. They say it's for our own protection.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay goes over to the door and tries to open it, but it is sealed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST TWO<br />
Don't waste your time. It won't open.</blockquote>

<p>[Ronon primes his pistol and stuns Sheppard, who collapses unconscious onto the ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Never gets old.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon hogties the unconscious Sheppard on the bench inside the jumper and heads out.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sorry, buddy. You're just going to slow me down.</blockquote>
<p>[He closes the jumper door with the remote and runs off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How's it coming, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm just about finished&#8230;I-I think.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear a clatter outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will go see. Keep working.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla steps into the corridor outside. McKay looks nervous, then turns back to his computer.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla cautiously walks around. Lorne's team comes around a corner, raising their weapons instantly upon spotting her.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Don't move!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
Major Lorne. It's me, Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You shouldn't be out here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major, it's me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Everyone's been ordered back to the mess hall.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But Doctor McKay and I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Put your hands on your head&#8230;slowly.</blockquote>
<p>[Two of the men step forward with restraints ready. When they get close enough, Teyla fights them off with hand to hand. Her movements allow her to dodge Lorne's blast. She gets a stunner off one guard then uses him as a shield. She backs away as Lorne hits his man. They give chase.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispering)<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[He approaches the door, but sees no one.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh god.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and his lone man chase Teyla. They shoot their stunners at each other. One man finally hits Teyla with a stunner blast. They approach cautiously, but she is out cold.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
All right, let's get her up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay fumbles with a camcorder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on&#8230;All right, look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that. You need to focus! I'm sure you're wondering&#8230;who tied you to the desk.</blockquote>
<p><b>PRESENT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIG</b>
</p><p>[Teyla paces inside. Lorne enters. He's sweating and looking ill.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You're awake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major Lorne, you must set me free&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Save it. You're not going anywhere 'till I get some answers. I need to know what you've done to my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What I've done? You believe I'm behind this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Is-is it a drug? Some kind of bio-weapon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major, they're sick. You as well. The entire base is infected with a disease.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Everyone except you.</blockquote>
<p>[He fumbles in a pocket for his bottle of stimulants.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. I'm immune to its effects.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(popping more pills)<br />
Isn't that convenient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(cautiously)<br />
How many of those have you taken?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Why don't you just let me worry about that, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's the pills. They're what's making you act like this. They're confusing you. They're making you unstable!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Making me unstable?! I'm not the one who unleashed a disease on my people, okay? Quit stalling. I want to know what you were doing in the hall&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He is shot from behind by a stunner blast. Carter wields the stunner. She, McKay, and Zelenka enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(relieved)<br />
Yes. It's good to see you. Colonel Carter, Doctor Zelenka, you as well. How did you find me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Uh, well, we were having trouble finding you by ourselves, so we followed him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Eh, did you finish your work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wh-what do you mean?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs and moves over to the control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can you disarm the force shield?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies the panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I don't know. Wait&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He looks on his arm and reads some information, then presses keys on the control panel. The shield deactivates, and the door opens. Teyla steps out.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Quickly.</blockquote>
<p>[She leads them out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEW LANTIA MAINLAND, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[Ronon runs back to the jumper with two full bags of plants. He finds the ramp down, with no Sheppard in sight. He groans in frustration and checks inside the jumper, dropping his bags and priming his gun. As he steps out, Sheppard comes up from behind where he's been hiding next to the vehicle. He raises his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't move! Drop it.</blockquote>
<p>[Angry, Ronon complies, raising his hands in surrender.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now back away.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes a few steps and turns. Sheppard reaches down and grabs Ronon's gun, keeping his pistol trained on Ronon the whole time.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now. Tell me. Who the hell are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I know you don't remember everything. You have no idea what's going on. You're confused. Maybe even a little scared. I know I would be. But you have to trust me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard cocks his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're friends! The things we've been through together&#8230;I don't care what anyone says, no disease can wipe that away, not completely. Okay? Deep down, you know I'm telling the truth. Now give me the gun.</blockquote>
<p>[While Ronon's been speaking, Sheppard's been giving careful thought to what he says. His pistol lowers slightly. But at the last sentence, Sheppard raises it again, alert.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, nice try. For all I know, you're the one who tied me up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Fine. Then shoot me. Then you'll be all alone, in the middle of a dark forest with no idea who you are, where you're going, or what you're gonna do next. How could I possibly make it any worse?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a good point.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon smiles and motions to lower the gun. Sheppard uncocks his weapon.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Teyla leads the others inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Here. Sit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not know how.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, and I do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes! You created the override program. You said you were almost finished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(desperate, sarcastic)<br />
Oh, then it should be easy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(encouraging)<br />
Rodney, listen to me. You must do this, it is our only chance. The knowledge is inside you, you just have to find it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at the computer, then presses Enter. The program runs, then a screen says "Program Complete."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Wow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
He did it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When I said I was almost finished, I-I guess I wasn't kidding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Now what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, now, we just have to hope that Colonel Sheppard and Ronon completed their side of the mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right&#8230;right.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter, Zelenka, and McKay all turn to Teyla.]
</p><p>CARTER, MCKAY, AND ZELENKA
Who?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARINE THREE<br />
A ship. Headed for the bay doors on the roof.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
Have they identified themselves?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARINE THREE<br />
No, sir. It could be help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
It could also be some kind of an attack. Get in touch with the others. Tell them to meet me at the jumper bay. Find Major Lorne!</blockquote>
<p>[He heads out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon's jumper lands on the floor of the bay.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Nice flying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs the sacks as the doors open.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Come on, help me with the stuff. We've got to get it to Teyla straight away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[They exit and are instantly stopped by the Kemp and his men, weapons raised.]
</p>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
Hands in the air. Now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Listen, Lieutenant, this is medicine. We need to deliver it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
I said, hands in the air.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is pulled aside by a soldier. A frustrated Ronon throws down his sacks and raises his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
Let's take them to the brig.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're making a mistake. There are sick people who need that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low to Ronon)<br />
You sure you know what you're doing?</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What the hell is going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
Sir. We caught these men trying to infiltrate the base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Lorne, you have got to listen to me. Everybody on this base is going to die if you don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
And who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Look in your pocket.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Just look in your vest pocket!</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne looks in the pocket that Ronon indicates. He pulls out a picture. It's a Polaroid of Sheppard. Underneath is written: "Lt. Col John Sheppard. He is your commanding officer. Trust him."]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You took a picture of him, just in case it came to this. I was there.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne compares the picture to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
He's telling the truth. This is our commanding officer.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks nonplussed, but rolls with the change in fortune.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's right. I am your commanding officer. So&#8230;you should do what I say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Yes, sir. What are your orders?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(after a pause, indicating Ronon)<br />
Do what he says.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Gun.</blockquote>
<p>[The guard hands back Ronon's weapon. Ronon picks up the sacks of plants.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Follow me.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard wakes up slowly in an infirmary bed. Teyla and Ronon are by his side.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel, you're awake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(groggily)<br />
Mmm. What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla distributed the plant through the ventilation system. Knocked you out for a bit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How long have I been asleep?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
'Bout a day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A day?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hit some people harder than others.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How you feeling, John? How's your memory?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, pretty good, I think. I mean&#8230;things are a little fuzzy. If I forget your birthday next year&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
I will forgive you. When you are feeling well enough, Major Lorne wishes to speak with you. He feels badly about what happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It wasn't his fault. Just glad he still had the photo I gave him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That was good thinking, by the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. If the distribution of the cure had been delayed any longer, many more people would have died.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried)<br />
What do you mean?<br />
(looking around)<br />
Where's McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[In another section of the infirmary. McKay has his head down on Katie's bed while he holds her hand. She is unconscious. Keller comes over.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You should get some sleep.</blockquote>
<p>[He raises his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's okay. I'm&#8230;fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I can let you know when she wakes up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay. She's not giving up, you know. She's a fighter.</blockquote>
<p>[She rubs his arm, then walks away. McKay notices her hand shifting on his.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Katie?</blockquote>
<p>[Katie stirs slightly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Doctor?!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller rushes back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's moving her fingers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Katie? Katie! Hey.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie awakens.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Wha&#8212;where am I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're in the infirmary. You're safe. Do you remember anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Um&#8230;<br />
(she spots McKay)<br />
Rodney? It's good to see you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(relieved)<br />
Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes her hand.]
