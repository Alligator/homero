</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I watched it last night. There was hardly any fighting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's because it's not about fighting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then why's it called <i>Blades of Glory</i>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because it's about&#8230;skate blades.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(dubious)<br />
And this is a real sport? Men and women dancing around on ice?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Unfortunately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Your planet's weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mm, you can say that again.</blockquote>
<p>[They reach Sheppard's quarters. Just as Sheppard opens the door, Carter arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Colonel&#8230;I was just coming to see you. Do you have a minute?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, sure.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter glances from Ronon to Sheppard and licks her lips uncomfortably.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, I received a message from Stargate Command. I'm afraid I have some bad news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Your father suffered a heart attack last night. I'm sorry, John, but he passed away.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks stunned.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STANTON RESEARCH LAB, EARTH, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;STANTON RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[A young woman, Ava, searches the United States area for news, finding an obituary for Sheppard's father. The headline reads "Utilities Mogul Patrick Sheppard Dies at 69". She punches buttons on the computer, then walks over to the printer. On the table are several other articles, as well as surveillance photos of Ronon and Sheppard from when they arrived at the Miller home in Vancouver when Jeannie was kidnapped.]

</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard packs a duffle bag. The door opens.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey&#8230;I, uh&#8230;heard what happened. I'm very&#8230;sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(subdued)<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard finishes packing.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, I-I requested to go back with you, but the Ancient device on M7G-677 is malfunctioning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Isn't that the planet with all the kids?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unhappy)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That should be fun for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, believe me, I would get out of it if I could, but, uh, without the EM field, they're an easy target for the Wraith. I guess it's just&#8230;bad timing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eh, don't worry about it.</blockquote>
<p>[There is an awkward silence.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You want to talk, or&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[After another awkward silence, McKay clears his throat and goes. Sheppard appears contemplative.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stands waiting, holding his duffel, as the Stargate dials. Ronon comes up next to him, wearing a black t-shirt and grey khakis, and carrying his own duffel.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where are you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
With you.</blockquote>
<p>[When the Stargate activates, Ronon is the first through as Sheppard still processes this.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SHEPPARD ESTATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Several cars arrive and park along the long driveway in front of the mansion. Beside it is a large horse paddock. Sheppard wears a suit and tie. Ronon wears a black button-down shirt and black pants; they step out of a car.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
A lot of people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, well, my old man was pretty well connected.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard spots his brother Dave approaching and fidgets nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dave.</blockquote>
<p>[They shake hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
I wasn't sure you were going to make it. It's good to see you. I contacted your unit commander at Peterson, but, um, sometimes those messages don't seem to reach you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I came as soon as I heard.</blockquote>
<p>[Dave looks to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is, uh, Ronon. Ronon, this is Dave, my brother.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon's been watching this tense conversation with interest. He shakes hands with Dave.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, nice to meet you.</blockquote>
<p>[Dave takes in Ronon's wrinkled shirt and dreadlocks and looks from Ronon to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
Pleasure
(to Sheppard)<br />
You two, uh&#8230;work together&#8230;in the Air Force?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's a civilian contractor.</blockquote>
<p>[Dave rolls his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
Right. Anyway, John, I think we should probably talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
I'll catch up with you later.</blockquote>
<p>[Dave walks away. From the nearby patio, Ava stands watching Sheppard and Ronon. She smiles.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATRIUM, SHEPPARD ESTATE</b>
</p><p>[Mourners leave the room where Sheppard's father is laid out in a closed casket. Sheppard enters and pays his respects, staring down at the coffin. Ronon starts to enter the room, then notices what's inside; he steps back, giving Sheppard privacy.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SHEPPARD ESTATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon goes down the buffet line, piling as much food as he can onto his little plate. He looks up to see two mourners watching him with interest.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This is free, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE MOURNER<br />
(bemused)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs some more, stuffing a final bite into his mouth as he walks away. He joins Sheppard near a fence where horses are paddocked, not far from the swimming pool. Sheppard is staring at them, fidgeting with a piece of grass.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(mouth full)<br />
Lots of food over there.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances at Ronon's overfilled plate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This the house you were raised in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(flatly)<br />
One of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's nice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I couldn't wait to get out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My dad's idea of teenage rebellion was going to Stanford instead of Harvard.<br />
(catching Ronon's blank expression)<br />
Never mind. He just&#8230;he had everything planned out for me since I was about fourteen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, so what do we do now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mostly people sit around, drink, eat&#8230;<br />
(glances at Ronon's plate)<br />
&#8230;some more than others. Mostly they talk. They don't know what to say, but they talk.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks around and sees Dave mingling easily with other people.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well, your brother seems to be handling it well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what he does&#8212;he handles things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How come you never mentioned him before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's complicated.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon raises his eyebrows, but doesn't say anything. Sheppard looks around and notices Nancy heading towards them. He does a double-take then hangs his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I told you I had an ex-wife, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Here she comes.</blockquote>
<p>[He spins to greet her.]
</p>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
Hi, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nancy&#8230;I didn't expect to see you here.</blockquote>
<p>[Nancy steps forward and gives him an awkward hug.]
</p>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
I'm very sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh&#8230;Nancy, Ronon. Ronon, Nancy.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Nancy shake hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
Pleased to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How long are you here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
Just for today. I have to be in Washington tomorrow, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Still with Homeland Security?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
Yeah. I just got promoted. I'm a director now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Congratulations. How's&#8230;how's Greg?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
(wincing)<br />
Grant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Grant.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes this as he cue to step back. He surreptitiously wanders closer to the fence .]
</p>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
Um&#8230;he-he would've come, but he's, uh, trying a case in Phoenix.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh. Sounds like he's doing well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
Yeah, he is. He's uh&#8230;yeah, he's doing well.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange awkward expressions.]
</p>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
You know, your dad was always very good to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(clearing his throat)<br />
Well, in <i>his</i> mind, marrying you was probably the best thing I ever did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NANCY<br />
(sighing uncomfortably)<br />
Okay. Well, it's good to see you again, John. Take care of yourself.<br />
(louder, to Ronon)<br />
It's nice to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(turning and nodding)<br />
Oh. Nice to meet you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD DEN</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon step up to the bar. Ava approaches them.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
My name is Ava Dixon. You must be Ronon.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon become more alert at her awareness of Ronon's identity.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do I know you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
No, we've never met, but you knew the man I used to work for&#8212;Henry Wallace?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't ring a bell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Look, I realize you have to keep up appearances in public, but I don't have time to play games. Henry Wallace was the man who kidnapped your colleague, Doctor Rodney McKay, and forced him to work on a highly illegal research project involving alien tech&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(leaning in, sharply)<br />
Who the hell are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
We need to talk, but not here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SHEPPARD ESTATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Ava, and Ronon head to the car. Dave and Sheppard spot each other. Sheppard tosses the keys to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Take her to the car.</blockquote>
<p>[He hangs back. Dave walks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
John, I was thinking that we should probably&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, something came up, I gotta go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
(upset)<br />
It's Dad's wake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know, but this is work-related.</blockquote>
<p>[Dave rolls his eyes and leans back.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
Oh, oh. What is it, top secret? National security? That sort of thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, something like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
You know, this is so typical.</blockquote>
<p>[He scoffs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You got something to say, just say it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
Look, there's just one thing I want to know: what's your level of expectation here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
I mean, are you going to challenge the will?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at him, stunned.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
I have no idea what it says, of course, but I think I can guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(aghast)<br />
That's what you want&#8230;to talk about? You want to talk about money?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
That's why you're here, isn't it? You've been gone a long time, John. It's not such a stretch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(fuming, hurt)<br />
You got nothing to worry about.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to stalk off.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
Hey! If I've got the wrong impression of you, it's not my fault. You're the one who left, remember? I stayed; I looked after Dad; I ran the business while you're off doing&#8230;God-knows-what.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm assuming that's what Dad wanted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
(sadly)<br />
No. No, it's not, John. Dad regretted what happened between you two&#8230;right up 'till the end.</blockquote>
<p>[Dave gives Sheppard an appraising look before rejoining the guests. Sheppard stays rooted for a moment, then joins Ronon and Ava.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SUBURBAN STREET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;RESTAURANT</b>
</p><p>[Ava sits at a table with Ronon and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I would've come to you sooner, but you're a hard man to find.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, you got our attention. What's this all about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
For the past three years, I've been working for a company called Stanton Research, a division of Devlin Medical Technologies. I was recruited out of college by a brilliant scientist named Doctor Richard Poole, and together we worked on a secret project code named "Archetype".</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What kind of project?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
We were experimenting with nanite programming, trying to increase the complexity of their interactions.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon exchange wary looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Listen, I wasn't aware of what happened to Doctor McKay and his sister until much later. At the time, all I knew was that we'd been given a key piece of programming&#8212;something that allowed us to make a major breakthrough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Well, it's one thing to inject nanites into a mechanical or a biological system for the purpose of affecting changes at a molecular level. But, it's quite another to use them as building blocks to create an entirely self-sustaining entity.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;STANTON RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
To be honest, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime, but then all of a sudden, we began making incredible advancements, and the next thing I knew, there it was.</blockquote>
<p>[Poole and Ava work in a lab. They approach a male human-form Replicator lying on the table. Obeying Poole's instructions on a tablet computer, its eyes open and the metallic milkiness fades away to human shaped irises.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You built a Replicator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Technically, that term isn't accurate, because self-replicating isn't one of its primary directives, but&#8230;yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's no way you had authorization to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Richard told me the project was being funded at the highest levels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And you believed him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Maybe it sounds a little naive, but, well, Richard was like a father to me. My own parents died when I was very young. I trusted him.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
But then one day, he came back to the lab in a panic.</blockquote>
<p>[Poole races into the lab in a panic. The Replicator looks up from where he lies on his bed. Ava rises from her computer station.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<p>[Pools begins to grab backup disks and shutting down systems.]
</p>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
There's been a security breach. We have to shut everything down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I don't understand!</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
Look, I don't have time to explain it to you right now. Just do it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I later found out what was really going on. The IOA's investigation of Devlin Medical was closing in, and Richard wanted to get rid of the evidence.</blockquote>
<p>[Poole carries his tablet computer and approaches the male Replicator.]
</p>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
I'm sorry about this.</blockquote>
<p>[The Replicator exchanges looks with Ava. He turns back and grabs Poole by the arm, throwing him across the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Richard!</blockquote>
<p>[She runs to him. Poole groans. Ava pushes the alarm as the Replicator pulls the door off its hinges and escapes. Meeting two guards in the hallway, he breaks their necks. Ava runs down the hall but finds no one but the dead guards.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
He killed to escape. If he's threatened, he could kill again. I had to do something.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're telling me there's a Replicator loose on Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How long?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Well, he escaped three weeks ago. We've been working on a way to track him, but so far had no success. He could be anywhere by now.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;STANTON RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Ronon, and a military SWAT team swarm the lab, catching Poole off-guard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SWAT MEMBER<br />
Show your hands! Get em up!</blockquote>
<p>[Poole raises his hands. Ronon pulls them behind his back to handcuff him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SERGEANT<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Sir, the facility is secure. Looks like he was the only one here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
(scornfully)<br />
Colonel Sheppard&#8230;and Ronon, of course. How did you find me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we had a little help.</blockquote>
<p>[Ave enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
Ava&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I'm sorry, Richard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
Ava, my God! Do you realize what you've done?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I didn't have a choice! I couldn't let this continue any longer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
I had the situation under control!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Your little science project got two of your own men killed! And he's still on the loose! I don't think you have control of anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
He killed in self-defense! If he's not threatened again, he won't harm anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, that's because we're going to find him; and we're going to neutralize him; and you&#8230;are going to help.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a device from a SWAT member and places it in Poole's shirt pocket.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
<i>Apollo</i>, we're ready.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Ava, Ronon, and Poole are beamed out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Apollo</i> floats in orbit above Earth.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> INTERROGATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Poole sit across from each other at a small table. Ava stands near the door. Sheppard is still the suit from the funeral, although he no longer wears the tie.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Let's start with giving me the access code to the data files we recovered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
I don't think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(leaning forward)<br />
You do know we will crack it eventually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
The entire directory is encrypted with a 448-bit key symmetric algorithm. Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ava)<br />
What about you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
I never gave her the code. It was for her own protection. Look&#8230;I'll cooperate, as long as you guarantee that I get to bring him in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Forget it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
We are talking about an incredibly advanced and valuable piece of technology here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've had your chance. Now it's my turn. You gonna help us track this thing or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I'll help you, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>POOLE<br />
Ava&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Be realistic, Richard. He's out there alone. You know he's not programmed for ordinary social interaction. What happens if someone accidentally frightens him or corners him? We can't afford to wait any longer.</blockquote>
<p>[Poole looks resigned.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon walk down a hall. Bates, dressed in a civilian suit, comes out a different passage.]
</p>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Colonel Sheppard!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Bates!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You two know each other?</blockquote>
<p>[Bates and Sheppard share a warm handshake.]

<blockquote>BATES<br />
Assuming he knows where it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Well, to be perfectly honest, we don't have anything else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a good point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
All right. I'll set up a stake-out, and if he shows up, we'll know about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This could be our last shot at this guy. We've got to make sure he goes down for good this time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
That's not going to be easy. I mean, if this were the movies, we'd dip him into a vat of molten steel, or&#8230;a volcano.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee chuckles. Ronon looks at him, puzzled; Sheppard looks at him, intrigued.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
You know, "the fires from whence he came."</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What the hell is he talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a really good idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON AND LEE<br />
(both surprised)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes off.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STANTON RESEARCH WAREHOUSE, READING, PA, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Several personnel take positions hiding around the warehouse.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sheppard, this is <i>Apollo</i>, we're all set.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard hide behind large crates. Sheppard has a shotgun.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Are you sure he's going to show up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The IOA said they spotted him nearby.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And what if he spotted them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Bates, see anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
(over radio)<br />
Negative. All quiet over here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Be patient. He'll show up.</blockquote>
<p>[Behind Ronon and Sheppard the Replicator drops from above, grabbing the two other soldiers, one in each hand and breaking their necks. Ronon spins and fires with his gun. The Replicator is able to approach before Ronon can shoot again, back-handing him. Ronon flies across the room, falling to the floor unconscious.]
</p><p>[Sheppard fires his shotgun. The Replicator turns and attacks before Sheppard can reload. He kicks Sheppard, sending him flying into a crate. The Replicator continues his attack, grabbing Sheppard by the throat and choking him while pinning him against the crate.]
</p><p>[Ava arrives and pulls the Replicator from Sheppard, throwing him across the room. Sheppard collapses in a heap on the floor. Ava glances at him, then goes to the Replicator. She tries to kick him, but he dodges her and counter-attacks. They fight hand-to-hand, trading martial arts moves at high speed. Sheppard groggily tries to get up, but finds it hard to move.]
</p><p>[Ronon regains consciousness, hearing them fight. The male Replicator gains the advantage on Ava&#8212;knocking her to the ground and then striking her with a large gas canister.]
</p>
<blockquote>REPLICATOR<br />
You should not have interfered.</blockquote>
<p>[He throws Ava into a crate. The impact breaks it. Ronon tries to attack the Replicator from behind. He gets in a few blows before the Replicator turns back, pinning Ronon against a wall and choking him.]
</p><p>[Sheppard stands up, unsheathing a knife attached to a red blinking device. He runs up and stabs the Replicator. The Replicator drops Ronon and turns to face this new threat.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Now!</blockquote>
<p>[The Replicator is beamed away. Ava stands up.]
</p>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
What happened? Where did you send him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(hoarsely)<br />
Low Earth orbit. I know by experience, reentry's a bitch.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Replicator floats above the atmosphere. Gravity pulls him towards Earth, the reentry breaking him apart into a fire-y disintegration.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Apollo</i> floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> LAB</b>
</p><p>[Bates, Ronon, Sheppard, and Lee watch a monitor showing Ava fidgeting while sitting at the table in the interrogation room.]
</p>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
The IOA isn't just going to let her go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If she'd stayed away, we never would've found her. The only reason she's here is because she chose to help us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
She's a machine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Well, we're all machines&#8230;just different kinds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What about if we took her to a different planet? Somewhere with no people, where she can't do any harm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think that's much of a reward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
The IOA would never agree to let her leave Earth anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
She could work at Stargate Command! She would be a valuable asset.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
She'd be a constant security threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
We don't know that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, he's right. There's no escaping the fact she's still a Replicator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So, what, then?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at Ava.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PARK, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ava walk on a path near a pond. Geese honk and others walk on the path.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How are you settling into your new life?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
It's a bit of an adjustment. One of the stipulations of my release is that I don't look for a job in any scientific field. To be honest, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eh, I'm sure you'll figure something out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I wanted to thank you, Colonel. I know they never would've agreed to let me go if you hadn't put in a word for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you saved my life. Putting a word in is the least I can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
I have to admit, I'm a little scared. I mean, I know these emotions are supposed to be artificial, but&#8230;they seem pretty real to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what do you got to be scared about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Well, I've never really been alone before. Richard was the closest thing I ever had to family. Anyway, uh&#8230;it was nice for you to check up on me. I guess we'll never see each other again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, one thing I've learned about my business is&#8230;never say never.</blockquote>
<blockquote>AVA<br />
Goodbye, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[Ava walks away. Sheppard's image fades out of the park behind her.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SCIENCE LAB, STARGATE COMMAND</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard slides out of an Ancient virtual reality pod. Lee waits anxiously. Ronon sits at a table nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
So? How was it in there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it was very nice work. Very convincing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
I 'm just able we were able to download her consciousness intact. Heh. Anyway, now she has a whole "virtual world" to explore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Should keep her pretty busy for a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So, uh, what happened to the rest of her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh, uh, they deactivated the bond between her nanites, effectively breaking her into base elements.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon turns his blank, puzzled look to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They scrapped her.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah. So, we heading back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. You, uh, go ahead. I got a few things to take care of.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. Lee and Ronon watch him go with puzzled frowns.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SHEPPARD ESTATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A cab pulls up. Sheppard exits, steeling himself before moving forward. He hesitates at the door, then knocks. Dave answers, looking surprised to see his brother. After a moment of staring at each other, Dave smiles and steps to one side.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVE<br />
Come in.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard enters.]
