</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, Sheppard, and McKay stare down into the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's just weird.</blockquote>
<p>[They watch as medical staff in hazmat suits check Beckett out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(with weak smile)<br />
I'm&#8230;sorry about all this, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's all right. I realize there's a protocol when dealing with someone who's been a prisoner for a long time. In fact, I wrote it. Although if you take much more blood, I think I might faint.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at the blood vial being drawn.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(with reassuring smile)<br />
That's the last batch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You should also check for trace narcotics. Michael was giving me regular injections of some sort of drug cocktail. Mostly sedatives, I think.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett smiles up at the trio watching him.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You sure he's not a Replicator?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, scans would've picked it up right away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then who the hell is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know! Look, I'm as freaked out about this as you are!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't really think it's him, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. Well, I mean&#8230;maybe. Look, so we've ruled out advanced robotics, that still leaves us a-a half a dozen possible other explanations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Like?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, like alternate timeline, parallel universe, cloning&#8230;you know, take your pick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just another day in outer space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, we've completed the preliminary exam.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Every test we've run confirms it. That man down there is Doctor Carson Beckett.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett paces the room. McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(pleased)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson. So sorry I haven't come by before now, it's been&#8230;pretty hectic here the last few days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's all right. I understand. Any word on when I can get out of here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That might&#8230;take a little time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Oh. Really.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay breaks into a smile and puts out his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
God, it's good to see you.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett shakes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Think about how I feel. I'm the one that's been a prisoner for almost two years.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits. McKay sits in the chair across from him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Two years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKTT<br />
Aye. Since M8G-352. The planet where we left Michael and the other converted Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Right. That's where you were captured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKTT<br />
Well, yes. You do remember, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yeah, I just&#8212;. Well, we need you to fill in some of the details.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, well, all right. Well, as you may have already guessed, the treatment was less than a hundred percent effective.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[Scenes from SGA 3.02 "Misbegotten" are shown, of the Wraith conversion process.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Despite the daily injections, some of them began to revert, including Michael. I think they may have used their Wraith telepathic abilities to summon a hive ship, but I can't be certain. All I know is, I was being interrogated by Michael, then he must have given me an injection of some kind, because the next thing I remember, I woke up on another planet.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why'd he take you prisoner?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He wanted help with his research, combining Wraith and human DNA. Of course, I refused at first. But then, one day, he brought another prisoner into my cell&#8212;a young lady, couldn't have been more than twenty years of age. And he killed her in cold blood right in front of my eyes. He said every day I refused to help, he'd kill another just like her. From that moment on, I cooperated.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks heartbroken.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson, I'm-I'm so sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It wasn't easy. I'll admit, at times I almost gave up hope. But that's when I thought about you, Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, and the rest of the team. I knew you'd be out there somewhere looking for me.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay can no longer look at Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah&#8230;See, the thing is&#8230;we weren't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Weren't what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We weren't looking for you. We didn't even know you were missing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We went back to M8G-352. We&#8230;rescued you from Michael. I mean, he got away, but we got you back to Atlantis, safe and sound.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(affronted)<br />
What in the hell are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, obviously not you-you, but another you. Another&#8230;Carson Beckett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Is this a joke?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I wish it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're telling me there's another Carson Beckett walking around this base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(exasperated)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He came back from the planet. He resumed his duties. Everything went back to normal. Then, about six months later&#8230;he was killed in an explosion. To us, you weren't missing, Carson. You-you were dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett is stunned.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Carter head from the Control Room towards her office.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Have you spoken to your Wraith contact?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He claims he's given us everything he knows about Michael, but uh, I assume he's lying. Until we can come up with something that he can use, he's not much good to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So we need to find our intel somewhere else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You mean Beckett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He has been inside Michael's operation, and he may know something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Or he could have been planted there for us to find. Look, for all we know, this whole thing could be a setup.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh sure, anything's possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sympathetically)<br />
John, the Carson Beckett you knew was killed. You were there; you all were. I'm sorry to say it, but you need to remember that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know this is a lot for you to take in&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, you're damn right it is! First you tell me I'm not the only Carson Beckett, and then you tell me the other one died in a horrible explosion! Oh my God. My mother! You didn't tell her, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Good lord!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You were dead! I mean, I'm sorry to be blunt, but we buried you. I mean, there was a memorial service at her church. I was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(half-hysterical)<br />
This can't be happening! I have to get back there. I have to talk to her!</blockquote>
<p>[The both stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you can't! I mean you have any idea what kind of effect that could have?! I mean, besides, what are you going to say to her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'll say the Air Force made a bloody mistake, that's what I'll say!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(placating)<br />
Carson&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, Rodney, this is too much! Get Doctor Weir in here! I need to speak to her right now!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is speechless.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Why not?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quietly)<br />
She's dead, Carson. She was killed by the Replicators. Sacrificed herself to save the rest of us. I'm sorry. I-I don't know what else to say.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sits back down.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(brokenly)<br />
You know, for the better part of two years, I imagined what it would be like the day I finally got back to Atlantis. This isn't exactly how I pictured it.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ABANDONED CITY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Michael's ship is parked by the city.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY STREETS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Michael, Teyla, Kanaan and other guards walk the streets of the city.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is this place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Just another dead world. Destroyed by the Wraith. Abandoned by the survivors. Forgotten by both. A perfect place to conduct my work.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE</b>
</p><p>[He leads Teyla to a large door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Open it.</blockquote>
<p>[His minions unlock and open the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I'll leave you to get reacquainted.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE CELL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla enters. Several people rise at her approach.]
</p>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla turns to see Halling coming down a staircase.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Halling?</blockquote>
<p>[They reach out and greet each other in the Athosian manner, foreheads touching.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Carter approaches Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What have you got for me, Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I think I've solved the mystery. You know what a telomere is, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's part of a human chromosome, right?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller leads her to a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, that's right. Each time a cell divides, the chromosome is torn apart and rebuilt. And in the process, a small amount of the telomere gets used up. As a result, telomeres become&#8230;shorter over time. The more we age, the shorter they get.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And this is Doctor Beckett's?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah. According to the scan, his telomeres are thirty percent shorter than they should be for a man of his age. The only explanation is that the original DNA came from an adult cell, one where the telomeres had already started to degrade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(wincing)<br />
So&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You can forget parallel universes. He's a clone.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE CELL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits with Halling and another woman on some crates.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I did not ever think I would ever see you again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Nor did we. I just wish it were under happier circumstances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where are the rest of our people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
They were taken.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Taken?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
To be experimented upon. Converted into one of those&#8230;things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How long has this been going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
For months. Since the day of our arrival.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
(gently)<br />
Kanaan was one of the first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know. I saw him on Michael's ship. But I did not realize it had happened to so many. I am so sorry. I should've been at the village the day you were captured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
There was nothing you could've done. Fifty men armed with stunners infiltrated our village under cover of night. We were taken completely by surprise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
These four walls have been our prison ever since.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You must not abandon hope. The people of Atlantis know of my disappearance, and they are looking for me. It will not be long before they come to our rescue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
That is a very pleasant thought. But until today, we held out the same hope about you.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett is shown the results. McKay, Keller, and a marine are nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know you would want to&#8230;see the results for yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And you're certain it's from my sample?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I ran the test myself, twice. There's no mistake. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It doesn't matter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, that's easy for you to say, but you're not the one who just found out he was made in a test tube.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As far as I'm concerned, one of the best friends I ever had just came back from the dead. I'm not going to quibble over a couple of&#8230;telomeres!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you kindly for that, but it still doesn't change the fact that I'm not the "real" Carson Beckett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no you're not! Because the real Carson Beckett wouldn't be standing here feeling sorry for himself. He'd be trying to figure out how to try and help us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm willing to do whatever I can, Rodney, but I'm not so sure that my help would be wanted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(blankly)<br />
Why wouldn't it be?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett turns and looks at the marine guarding him. Rodney finally understands.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard are with Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We're talking about someone who was for all intents and purposes, manufactured by one of the most dangerous individuals we've ever come across. Fundamentally, he's not that different from those hybrids, and I doubt very much we'd be arguing about whether we can trust them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But there's no denying the fact that he's no ordinary clone. I mean, somehow, Michael has managed to reproduce his&#8230;memories, his thought processes, I mean, his personality! I've spent some time with him, and I-I'm telling you, he's Carson!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It doesn't necessarily mean it's safe to act on any information he might give us. Look, he may genuinely believe that he's helping us, and still be playing right into Michael's hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's got a point, Rodney. What exactly is he offering?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He knows the layouts of at least, uh, four facilities that Michael has on different planets. Apparently he likes to move around a lot, stay one step ahead of the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about 'gate addresses?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they blindfolded him every time they moved him, so he couldn't see the DHD. Although, he did catch a glimpse of an address dialed by one of Michael's, uh, mercenaries. That could be a place to start.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Sheppard exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GEAR-UP ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team and another team gear up. Beckett is also there, gearing up anxiously. McKay looks worried.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Go ahead, Rodney. I'll catch up.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes his radio and leaves with the other team. Ronon also goes, barely glancing at Beckett as he leaves. Only Sheppard and Beckett are left. Beckett looks as Ronon passes.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Is he ever going to say a word to me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You gotta give him a break. He's not good dealing with this sort of thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What sort of thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, you know. Clones. Duplicates. People coming back from the dead. We went through this with Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney told me. It must be difficult.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He'll come around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett struggles to put on his pack. Sheppard helps him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you. I must be a wee bit rusty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're not rusty, Doc. You were just never very good at this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Fair enough.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to leave. Beckett holds Sheppard back.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
John, I just want to say, thank you&#8230;for trusting me. You'll have no regrets.</blockquote>
<p>[He taps him on the chest reassuringly and starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doc?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You forgot your radio.</blockquote>
<p>[He tosses it to Beckett. Beckett catches it and waves it around.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No regrets.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[The Lantian team enter the tavern. Everyone falls silent, watching the newcomers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(under his breath)<br />
Just in time for happy hour.<br />
(to barkeep)<br />
I was hoping maybe you could help us. We're looking for a friend of ours who's been know to stop in now and then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
You've come to the wrong place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We haven't even told you what he looks like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
You misunderstood me. No one here cares what he looks like. You've come to the wrong place if you're looking for information.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leans over the bar.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sotto voce)<br />
Look, I know you're trying to keep up appearances here for your friends, but, uh, I think we can make it worth your while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
I think it would be best if you turn around and be on your way.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks keenly at an open doorway on the second story.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Gun!</blockquote>
<p>[The team scatters, taking cover. The barkeep is riddled with bullets.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's P-90 fire!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon return fire, Ronon catching the shooter when his clip is empty. The shooter falls over the balcony to the first floor. Beckett immediately rushes over, checking him for injuries.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is he dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, but we need to get him back to Atlantis as soon as possible.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard exchanges looks with his teammates.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter waits by an active wormhole. Keller and a medical team arrive with a gurney.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Colonel Sheppard's team is coming back. They've got injuries.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team arrives. The other team carries the injured man on a stretcher.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Someone took a shot at us with a P-90. We're okay, but, you know&#8230;he took a little header off the balcony.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
A P-90? Where'd he get it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's the question.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett takes charge of transferring the injured man to the gurney.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
On three, one, two, three, up.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller starts to examine the man.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
GSC 6. Respiration 16, Pulse 150. Blood pressure 70 over 30. I applied pressure bandages at the scene.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods, peeling away some of the head bandages to look at him more closely. She back up in surprise.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know this man. His name's Nabel. When Teyla and I went to New Athos, he was there. He tried to kill us!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Carter exchange looks. Beckett starts to lead the team wheeling Nabel out.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's all right, love. He's unconscious now. And for the time being, in desperate need of our attention. You can confront him later. Right now, we need to save his life. Let's go, lads.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OPERATING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Keller and Beckett are among the team prepping for surgery.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Blood pressure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Fifty over forty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's dropping. We need to stop this bleeding. I need suction! Let's prep for a C-spine x-ray.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />

<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Any idea why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(shaking her head)<br />
I can only assume it's a complication due to the fact he's a clone. I've given him a course of&#8230;treatment to try and stimulate cell growth, but&#8230;it's a bit like trying to find a cure for old age.</blockquote>

Well, you survived for almost two years with Michael. I mean, shouldn't you have felt some kind of effects from this condition before now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, that's a good point. Don't take this the wrong way, but at the rate your cells are deteriorating, you should've died a long time ago.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett thinks back.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(realizing)<br />
The weekly injection he gave me. He said it was a sedative meant to keep me from trying to escape. But it must have been some kind of drug&#8230;to keep my cells from deteriorating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, you obviously don't have any of it with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No. Michael administered it himself, one dose at a time. But when Colonel Sheppard's team rescued me, it had only been four days since my last injection. Now, assuming it takes a full seven days to break down&#8230;</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Help him down.</blockquote>
<p>[He runs to the exit. McKay quickly follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Yeah.<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon picks Beckett up by the scruff of the neck with one hand and drags him with them.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team reach the exit just in time to see Michael's ship fly away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard walks with Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We searched the place top to bottom. No sign of her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well for now, we'll have to assume that she's still alive and that Michael has her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've got prisoners. They'll talk. We'll find her.</blockquote>
<p>[They enter the infirmary.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller leaves Beckett's bedside to meet them at the door. McKay stays by Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
His body's shutting down. There's nothing more I can do for him. We can't wait any longer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Zelenka's prepping the stasis pod.</blockquote>
<p>[Over by the bed&#8230;]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I had him in my sights. All I needed to do was pull the trigger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not your fault. He made you receptive to the mind link. It's how he controls all of them&#8230;the hybrids.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Still, it would have been nice to make a difference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You made a difference. We've got Michael on the run! It's just a matter of time before we catch up with him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, don't say anything. Okay? It's no big deal. You're gonna go into the stasis pod until we&#8230;figure out how to fix you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm a doctor. I know my own prognosis. Once I go into that pod, there's a good chance I won't come out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks away, sad.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STASIS ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay checks equipment nervously. Carter, Sheppard and Ronon stand nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(agitated)<br />
Right. All set.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller wheels Beckett in. She helps him out of the wheelchair.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(still embracing him around the shoulder)<br />
Listen&#8230;we're gonna keep working until we find a cure for this thing. I've got a whole team on it. Best people we have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Either way, we're gonna get the cure, soon as we capture Michael.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett turns to Carter. She looks at him, holding back tears.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Samantha, there's a letter in my quarters addressed to my mother. Don't worry. I was careful not to give everything away. Tell her you found it after you shipped my things. It's just some thoughts, things I should have said a long time ago.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(voice breaking)<br />
I'll make sure she gets it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks over to Sheppard and shakes his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't you worry, Doc. We're gonna have you out of there in no time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel, you bring her home now, you understand?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Count on it.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett turns to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(choked up)<br />
This is exactly what I was afraid of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know, big man. Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon hugs Beckett and steps back. Beckett pauses by McKay who turns away nervously for a moment. While McKay quickly speaks, Beckett continues on to the stasis chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(agitated)<br />
Right, well you won't feel a thing&#8212;aside from a-a cool burst when the pod first activates. And now your, uh, life-signs will be monitored on this machine here, 24/7.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you, Rodney.<br />
(to everyone)<br />
I want you all to know, that seeing you again, these last few days, it was all worth it. No matter what happens.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
You know, I was-was&#8230;toying with the idea of-of programming dreams into these things. Interested? I could have you fishing in the Highlands, um,&#8230;with a couple of tall, blond massage therapists?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(gently)<br />
Rodney&#8230;I'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's right, you will be. You know, 'cause this is not goodbye, this is, this is, uh&#8230;this is: "see ya later." That's what we agreed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Did we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's how I remember it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(buoyed by the optimism)<br />
All right, then. See you all later.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett braces himself. McKay frowns, then activates the controls. Beckett freezes in the stasis. Carter sighs. They all exchange sad looks.]
