</p><p>[Teyla briefs Carter and the other members of her team.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They are called the Vadeenans. I've known about them my entire life, but I've never met them. They do occasionally trade with others in the galaxy, but for the most part, they keep to themselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And you want to visit them because&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is said that their leader, a man named Davos, is a great seer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean, like a psychic?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not know the full extent of his powers, but it is rumored that he can&#8230;even glimpse the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Oh, give me a break.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You do not believe such a thing is possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, gee, let me think. Um&#8230;no. Look, in a-in a mechanical, Newtonian universe? Not a problem. I mean, you know enough variables, you can predict the outcome. But, uh, quantum physics blows that out of the water.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I understand your skepticism. Even among my own people, the stories were not widely believed. But I need to know for myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You think this Davos might be able to help you find out what happened to your people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I realize that it may seem&#8230;desperate, but&#8230;it has been several weeks, and our usual means of investigation have turned up nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney, what's the latest from the forensics team from New Athos?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, well&#8230;they're-they're still searching, but so far, they haven't found anything useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Intel hasn't turned up anything either. As far as we know, they vanished into thin air.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay are geared up and heading to the active Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Allow me to make a prediction. This will be a complete waste of time.</blockquote>
<p>[They meet up with Teyla and Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I knew you were going to say that. All right, from what Teyla says, these people sound a little skittish. You can bet that four heavily armed strangers showing up out of nowhere are going to set 'em off a little. So&#8230;let's be on our best behavior, children.</blockquote>
<p>[They step into the event horizon.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VADEENAN PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team steps out to find a large greeting party of Vadeenans who are smiling at the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>LINAR<br />
Welcome. You must be the people of Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to Teyla)<br />
These people don't look very surprised.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You sure you didn't tell them we were coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I've had no previous contact with these people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
My name is Linara.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
We know. We know all of you. You've been expected for some time now.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey arrives through the Stargate, wheeling a small rollaway suitcase behind him. Carter is there to greet him.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Mister Woolsey. How was your trip?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, spending a day in quarantine on the Midway station wasn't exactly my idea of a good time. But I suppose it beats a three week journey on the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[She and Woolsey walk up the steps and head through the control room to the balcony outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, that quarantine was only set up at the insistence of the IOA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
In response to some recent contagions that have taken hold on this base. Let's face it, Midway is the only buffer between Pegasus and the Milky Way. It can't hurt to err on the side of caution. Anyway, it gave me a chance to prepare for your three-month evaluation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(taking a nervous breath)<br />
Right. So, how am I doing so far?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That's exactly what needs to be determined. But I want you to know, I'm here as an observer only. I have no intention of getting involved in the day-to-day operations of the base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Really? Heh. That's refreshing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, the IOA has come to realize that bureaucratic interference on Atlantis isn't always as beneficial as we might like to hope. And, on a personal note, it's been brought to my attention in my own performance evaluations, that I can&#8230;on occasion&#8230;be a bit of a busybody.</blockquote>
<p>[He chuckles nervously and looks at Carter expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(over comm)<br />
Unscheduled offworld activation!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(smiling in relief)<br />
Excuse me.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks back into the control room, Woolsey follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
We're receiving a signal. It's Captain Robbins, on M2R-441.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to Woolsey)<br />
Uh, they're delivering medical supplies to a planet that was recently culled.<br />
(to Chuck)<br />
Patch 'em in.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey unzips his portfolio to take notes.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
Captain, this is Colonel Carter. Please report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROBBINS<br />
(over radio)<br />
We've had a bit of a development here, Colonel. According to the locals, a few days after the culling, another hive showed up. They didn't kill anybody, they just wanted the surviving villagers to deliver a message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
A message?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ROBBINS<br />
(over comm)<br />
That's right. Apparently, this particular Wraith wants to meet with Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VADEENAN PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Linara leads the team to her village.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, you're telling me Davos knew we were coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
He had a vision of your arrival. Before I take you to see him, there is something you should know. He's very ill. Our healers have done all that they can, but it's not enough. Some of us were hoping&#8230;well, if you do come from the city of the Ancestors&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We may be able to help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
(sighing in relief)<br />
We would be forever in your debt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He must be very important to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
We owe him our lives. Two years ago, he had a vision that the Wraith were coming. We had time to gather our provisions and escape to the caves in the northern mountains. Even from deep underground, we could hear their ships searching for us. Eventually, they went away and&#8230;never returned. Not a single Vadeenan was taken.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Impressive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
Of course for me, it's much more than that. He's my father.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DAVOS'S TENT</b>
</p><p>[Linara and the others arrive. Davos sits in a throne-like chair made of branches.]
</p>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
Father? The people of Atlantis are here to see you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVOS<br />
Yes. Yes, come in. I've been expecting you, and I know why you're here.<br />
(he turns to McKay)<br />
You have doubt in your heart.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at McKay, who shifts uncomfortably.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Anyone with a basic understanding of body language could've told you that.</blockquote>
<p>[Davos holds his hand outward.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVOS<br />
Among my gifts is the ability to show others what I can see.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you're the skeptic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(resigned)<br />
Fine.</blockquote>
<p>[He steps forward and takes Davos's hand.]
</p><p><b>VISION</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;MISTY UNNAMED PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team walks through the forest. They reach ruins and are surrounded by Wraith in a standoff.]
</p><p><b>END VISION</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DAVOS'S TENT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I think I just saw a vision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Of what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of us. Being captured by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team briefs Carter and Woolsey.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You said it was a forested planet, misty, with Ancient ruins.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's what I saw, yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter turns to Woolsey and raises her eyebrows.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
While you were gone, we received a report that the people of M2R-441 were recently visited by a Wraith. Now, from the description of his facial markings, it sounds a lot like the Wraith who helped you escape from the Genii last year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(surprised)<br />
My old buddy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nodding)<br />
Apparently, he has a matter of great importance that he wants to discuss with you. We already sent an advance team to the address that he proposed for the rendezvous. The interesting thing is it sounds an awful lot like the planet in McKay's vision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(skeptically)<br />
So we're believing this now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Davos did know we were coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Did you ask him about the Athosians?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I did not have a chance. After he showed Rodney the vision, he fell ill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They were hoping we could help him out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'll send Doctor Keller.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In the meantime, there's only one way to know for sure if he's right. Go to the rendezvous, check it out.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods. Woolsey shifts and clears his throat loudly.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(amused)<br />
Do you have something to add, Mister Woolsey?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, as I said before, I'm here strictly as an observer.<br />
(he hurriedly continues as they begin to rise)<br />
But since you ask, I have to wonder how wise it may be. I may share some of Doctor McKay's skepticism, but we don't need any mystical visions to tell us that this Wraith probably can't be trusted. You're talking about walking deliberately into a trap.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey turns to the others, who also nod.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;MISTY UNNAMED PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team walks through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is a bad idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're the one who said it's impossible to see the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I was thinking about that. I realized that quantum uncertainty doesn't necessarily preclude of, uh, seeing probable futures. It's like blackjack. You never know exactly what's gonna happen next, but, uh, a card counter can certainly increase the odds in his favor. And frankly, this feels like hitting on an eighteen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's more like doubling down against a ten.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;RUINS, MISTY UNNAMED PLANET, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hold on. This is the place. This is where it happened!</blockquote>
<p>[The team is surrounded by Wraith in a standoff.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You were supposed to come unarmed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Sorry about that.</blockquote>
<p>[Two puddle jumpers uncloak above their heads. Todd turns to Sheppard, who smiles and shrugs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter stands on the balcony by the active Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
How's the patient, Doctor?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DAVOS'S TENT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(into comm)<br />
Well, from what I can tell, he&#8230;seems to be suffering from a kind of lymphatic cancer. There's not a lot I can do for him here.</blockquote>
<p>[The rest of this conversation switches between Carter and Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Have you detected any physical anomalies that might be related to his visions?<br />
(to Carter on her glare)<br />
Sorry, force of habit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I don't really have the equipment with me that's necessary to make that kind of analysis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right. Why don't you bring him back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Understood. Um, just so we're clear, are we doing this to try and save his life, or&#8230;to study him?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter glares at Woolsey, who looks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'll have the infirmary prepped and ready for your arrival. Carter out.</blockquote>
<p>[She storms off. Woolsey discreetly follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard enter the brig room. The Wraith (Todd) is in the cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
So much for trust.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You tried to ambush us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I had no intention of causing you harm. But I could not guarantee your cooperation simply by&#8230;throwing myself at your mercy. My intent was to have this discussion on neutral ground.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A discussion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
The reason for my&#8230;contacting you. I require your help. We worked together once before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't mean I want to do it again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, more predictions. Just what I need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
As you know, Wraith are at war. I believe you refer to our enemy as the Replicators.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sounds vaguely familiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Well, we have a weapon. A virus that was designed to reset their attack directive causing them to stand down and return to their planet. At present, it is not working.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get to the part where we care.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
It is well known among the Wraith that Doctor McKay made certain changes to the Replicator base code, opening the door for them to alter their own programming. Well, knowingly or not, they have since repaired the weakness our virus exploited. Which means in order to get it working again, I need to know the changes Doctor McKay made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now here's the part you're not getting. We're glad they're kicking your ass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Only because you are as yet unaware of their new tactic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
They realized we have a significant vulnerability. Our food supply. They have begun to annihilate human worlds.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay brief Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You think he's telling the truth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He gave us an address. Claims it was a human planet the Replicators destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Is it in the database?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. M5S-768. We visited it last year. It <i>was</i> a thriving pre-industrial society.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Send a MALP.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The MALP goes through the active Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey, after watching the MALP leave, heads over to where Carter and Sheppard's team are crowded around a terminal where McKay is seated.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Receiving MALP telemetry. Here we go.</blockquote>
<p>[The monitor comes online, showing rubble and darkness.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No life signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How do we know the Wraith didn't do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The MALP's detecting residual radiation. The energy signature's consistent with Replicator weapons fire. He's telling the truth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How many people lived on that planet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We estimated somewhere between fifty and seventy-five thousand.</blockquote>
<p>[They all react with shock and sorrow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Linara stands beside the table where her father lies. Keller has a scanner move over him.]
</p>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
What does the machine do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It scans the cells in his body and reports any abnormalities. Hopefully, it'll help us figure out exactly what's wrong with him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
And then you'll be able to cure him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'll do my best.</blockquote>
<p>[She shuts the scanner off.]
</p>
<blockquote>DAVOS<br />
(sitting up)<br />
You'll have to forgive her, Doctor. She's not used to dealing with uncertainty. I may have spoiled her in that regard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, I heard about your gift. It's remarkable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAVOS<br />
I can see many things. But unfortunately, my own fate remains hidden from me.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks away as it not wanting to deliver bad news.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard are in his lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If we hadn't deactivated the attack code, this never would've happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It was my call, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But it was my idea. We had a ZPM, we had Elizabeth. All we had to do was leave. But I opened my big mouth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You never could've known it was gonna go this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, we don't know that for sure. Look, remember the nanovirus that caused the fatal aneurysms? I always suspected the Replicators were behind it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but you never proved it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but we know how they feel about the humans. They think we were a mistake. Look, we should've seen something like this coming.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Woolsey enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
John? Rodney? I know this news is hard for us to accept, but right now we need to focus. Figure out what our next step is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I suppose the most obvious solution is to shut down the attack code again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Can we do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's been done before, just&#8230;not by us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
By the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And what about our prisoner? What exactly is he proposing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, he claims to have the original virus that deactivated the attack code the first time. It's not working this time round because of the changes we made in the Replicator base code. Theoretically, knowing what we know and knowing what they know, we should be able to work together to shut them down again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, obviously that's out of the question.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Do I really have to remind everyone what happened the last time we cooperated with the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The circumstances have changed, and what happened to non-interference?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
As you said, the circumstances have changed. Colonel Sheppard, you've had the most experience dealing with the Wraith. Do you seriously think this is a good idea?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think it's not your call.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I need to contact my superiors.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Carter stands in her office. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's just been confirmed. Two more worlds have been destroyed. That makes three.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How many dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's just an estimate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How many?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A hundred and fifty thousand.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And this is just the beginning, isn't it? There's no reason to assume they're going to stop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No&#8230;What about Woolsey?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
He's contacted the IOA. They're taking the matter under advisement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, well, they're good at that. They'll bicker and argue, but at the end of the day, they're gonna leave you holding the bag, just like they did with Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Now I know why you didn't want the job. Look, John, Woolsey was right about one thing. You have had more experience with the Wraith than just about anyone. And in particular, with this Wraith. You have a history.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's not like we're dating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(smiling)<br />
I know we can't trust him, not completely. But what I don't know is whether or not it's worth the risk to play along with him, at least for a little while. You're the only one who can answer that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(over comm)<br />
Colonel Carter, this is Doctor Keller.</blockquote>

Oh, not good. He went into convulsions a while ago. I gave him a sedative. Truth is, we got him here too late. All I can do right now is alleviate his symptoms, but whether or not he survives, that's out of my hands. This is what I wanted you to see.</blockquote>

<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This is the result of his brain scan. He's showing abnormally high synaptic activity. It's similar to what happened to Doctor McKay when he encountered that ascension device, only not as extreme. And in his case, it's not advancing. Presumably he's been like that his whole life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You're saying he was born this way?</blockquote>

He's a genetic accident. One in a million, if not more. Oh, um, by the way Mister&#8230;Woolsey's already asked for a copy of these test results.</blockquote>

No.</blockquote>

I'm sorry.</blockquote>

The second hive just jumped out of hyperspace. This is it&#8230;First hive is sending a transmission. They're probably trying to explain what they're doing here.</blockquote>

They're still just talking. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. We got problem.</blockquote>

Both ships just powered weapons.</blockquote>

That's it. Firing drones.</blockquote>

Shut up, Woolsey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />

Colonel Sheppard, as a ranking representative of the IOA, I'm assuming command of this base. I'm ordering you to launch the drones now!</blockquote>

Definitely. They're not pulling any punches, either.</blockquote>

Was either ship able to get off a subspace message?</blockquote>

Oh, right.</blockquote>
<p>[He checks his computer.]
</p>

Negative. We-we're good!</blockquote>

I'm taking him back to Vadeena. To be buried according to our custom.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is good that he is going home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINARA<br />
I don't know what my people will do without him. He's always been there, warning us of danger, protecting us from harm. Now for the first time in my life, I fear the future.</blockquote>
<p>[She tears up. Teyla grasps her arm comfortingly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just because something is unknown does not necessarily mean it needs to be feared. Trust yourself, and the rest will unfold as it is meant to.</blockquote>
<p>[Linara nods and leaves. Keller comes over.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He was an interesting man.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. He knew that I was pregnant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Really? You know, pretty soon, other people are going to find out, too. You're gonna have to tell them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<p>[She sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIG</b>
</p><p>[Todd sits on a bench. Several guards surround him as Sheppard comes near. The Wraith starts to exit the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
So all it took was the destruction of my ship for you to finally trust me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, not true. I still don't trust you.<br />
(to guards)<br />
Take him to the lab. He's got work to do.</blockquote>
<p>[The guards have restraints ready. The Wraith sighs as he allows himself to be led away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter waits by the active wormhole. Woolsey walks up, rolling his case.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well&#8230;this is awkward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nodding)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
For the record, I thought I was making the right call.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It was a difficult situation&#8230;for everyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I just have one last question. How did you know the two Wraith ships would fire on each other?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I didn't.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey looks confused.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You going to put that in your report?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It probably would be better if I didn't. There may be such a thing as being&#8230;too thorough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey leaves. The wormhole deactivates. Carter smiles, then begins to walk away. Sheppard arrives and meets her. They walk down the corridor together.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Woolsey?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh, you just missed him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That hurts my feelings. I didn't even say goodbye yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How's McKay doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He and the Wraith are back at it, but, uh, I guess they're having a problem getting this virus to work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'd hate to think this was all for nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we got out alive, and we kept our location secret. That still counts for something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Still thinking about those visions, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sighing)<br />
I can't get them out of my head. Everything Davos saw came true!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For all we know, then it won't come true for another thousand years!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Or it could come true tomorrow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. So, what else is new?</blockquote>
