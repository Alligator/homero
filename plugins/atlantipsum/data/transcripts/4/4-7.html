<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla enters to find Keller packing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you ready? They're preparing to dial the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, almost finished.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks around at the other large bags already packed to the brim. Keller notices.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know. I'm terrible at packing. I never know how much to bring.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes over to some shelves to find more supplies.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We're only going overnight. I'm sure you have enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, you'd think so, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You seem nervous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, no. I'm fine&#8230;well, maybe a little. Going off-world is still kinda new to me. Whole other galaxy and meeting new civilizations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My people are very welcoming, and they're eager to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I'm eager to meet them too. Learn about their culture and their history.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
A gesture for which they will be most grateful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's just&#8230;I know they were very fond of Carson. I only hope to make half the impression he did.</blockquote>
<p>[She tries to stuff a large plastic tub into one of the bags.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What are those?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh. Lollipops. For the kids. It makes the check-ups go easier.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You will make a wonderful impression.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller smiles shyly and zips up her bag.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Keller and Teyla walk in. Teyla makes last minute touch ups to her outfit. Sheppard watches them from the balcony above.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoo, look at you! Got a date?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(rolling her eyes)<br />
Please. You will contact us if you need us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, we'll be fine. You kids have fun.<br />
(to Keller)<br />
You're gonna love the Athosians.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm going to experience my first Tandul feast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, those are good. But watch out for the&#8230;um&#8230;whaddya call it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Roos wine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Roos wine. Tasty stuff, but helluva kick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We really should be going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have fun, kids.</blockquote>
<p>[They go through the wormhole.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The settlement is through the woods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Lead the way!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It&#8230;is some distance. Let me help you with those.</blockquote>
<p>[She reaches for one of Keller's bags.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, no-no. It's okay. I'm the idiot who overpacked. I should be the idiot carrying them.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks at her, then nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(grinning)<br />
So Sheppard was right, huh? About that hot date tonight?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles but says nothing.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They reach the outskirts of the settlement. By now, Keller only carries the pack on her back. Teyla is hefting the two large duffle bags. No one else is around.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(winded)<br />
I didn't think it would be this far! Is it always this quiet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(worried)<br />
Something is wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[She drops Keller's bags and hurries forward. The settlement is empty.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hello?! Hello! Is anybody here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Where is everyone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not know. But they did not leave of their own accord.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Are you saying they were attacked?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Or culled.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOSIAN SETTLEMENT, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Keller look for signs of what has happened to the people.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I thought the Wraith didn't know about this planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That was my understanding as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well then, how could they just&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla raises her hand for silence.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(more quietly)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks around then pulls Keller into some brush to hide. A couple of primitively dressed men approach the duffle bags Teyla abandoned and start searching them.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You know them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(tightly)<br />
We must leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla moves while the men are distracted. A confused Keller follows.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla leads Keller through the woods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Over here.</blockquote>
<p>[She directs them to a large stump where they crouch and hide.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The weapons cache is too far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Better to make a run for the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts tugging at Keller's pack.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What are you&#8212;what are you looking for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Did you bring a weapon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No. That's just medical supplies. Don't you have a weapon?!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla brandishes a large knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just a knife. I was coming to visit my people. I did not believe I would need a gun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Who are those men?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELA<br />
Bola Kai.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You know them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know of them. The markings on their faces are distinctive to their tribe. But I have never crossed paths with them&#8230;until now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Are they dangerous?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla finishes rummaging through Keller's pack.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Beyond dangerous. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller puts her pack back on. Teyla leads Keller through the woods again. They head up a steep incline. Two-thirds of the way up, Keller slips and tumbles down the hill, landing on her pack.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<p>[She reaches for her ankle. Teyla clambers back down the incline.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I twisted my ankle.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nervously looks around.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We have to keep moving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Just&#8230;hang on a second.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(urgently)<br />
Is it broken?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller examines it some more.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No, I don't think so. It's probably just sprained.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla helps Keller to her feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Leave the bag. It's too heavy.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes it from Keller and puts it by a tree, covering it with some brush. They head towards the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They arrive at the Stargate, still moving through the woods. They hide behind a tree as they see two Bola Kai at the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh God, what do we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is too risky to return to the weapons cache.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What weapons cache?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We gave my people guns to protect themselves in the event they were raided.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What&#8230;what makes you think that the guns would still be there? Wouldn't that be the first thing those guys would steal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If the Bola Kai stole them, they would be using them. But the weapons cache is too far, especially in your condition. And we have no idea how many more Bola Kai are out there.</blockquote>
<p>[She unsheathes her knife and offers it to Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Our best option is to take out these guards by ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Take them out?! What are you talking about? How are we gonna do that?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(desperately)<br />
I don't know yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nervous)<br />
Hey, listen. I am not like you. I don't know anything about&#8230;fighting.</blockquote>
<p>[She stares at the knife now in her hand. Teyla grabs a thick arm-length stick.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just do what I say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I want to, believe me, but I&#8230;I don't think I can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You must think otherwise. What we first need to do is create a div&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Two other Bola Kai arrive at the DHD. One of them spots Teyla and Keller. Teyla instantly drags Keller away. The Bola Kai give chase. They come to the edge of an outcropping, and spot nothing. Below the outcropping, the two women hide. Teyla has her hand covering Keller's mouth. When she hears the Bola Kai move away, she removes her hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They are gone. Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(shocked and fighting tears)<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know this is something for which you are unprepared.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I should be prepared. I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Unfortunately, I'm afraid things may get worse before they get better. Those guards will alert the others to our situation. They will hunt us. The longer we avoid capture, the better our chances. They will continue to guard the 'gate, yes, but in time, Atlantis will realize we are late, and they will send a rescue team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
But we're not due back 'till tomorrow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is therefore critical that we elude capture until then. What do you need to help your injury?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I should probably wrap it, but the Ace bandages are in the medical kit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
The kit is on the way to the weapons cache. Hopefully, it'll still be where we&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[She breaks off as they hear a drum beating in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(voice flat, disappointed)<br />
They are summoning the others. Gathering them. The hunt is beginning.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They reach the area where they abandoned Keller's pack. Keller leans against a tree and lowers herself to sit while Teyla retrieves the pack from under the hidden brush.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, thank God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You must move quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I will.</blockquote>
<p>[She first grabs a medicine bottle and opens it. Teyla glances over as she keeps watch.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Ibuprofen. It helps with the pain and swelling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Doctor McKay uses them frequently. Along with antihistamines, antacids, motion-sickness pills&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You forgot the prescription I just wrote him for "restless-leg syndrome." I've always been a wimp. I've a low threshold for pain.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller winces as she removes her shoe and sock and starts to wrap the bandage.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
People often underestimate the level of discomfort they are capable of enduring. When I was a child, several of us were sent into the woods for ten days alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Ten days, alone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is a rite of passage among my people. No food, no water. Forced to survive on our own. None of us believed we could endure it, but all of us did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I went to summer camp. There were other kids. We had cabins. With beds. And electricity. And food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I&#8230;see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I didn't even make it three days. Got homesick. Called my parents to come and get me.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods, steps away and rolls her eyes.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WOODS, WEAPONS CACHE, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The pair continue to move through the woods. Teyla carries the medical pack on her back and still holds the stick she recovered. Keller limps along behind. They reach the cache to find it already searched and empty.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
The weapons cache?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, where are the weapons? I mean, obviously the Bola Kai don't have them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My people must have needed them to fight off the attack. But then why were they not successful? The Bola Kai's weapons would have been no match against these.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;NEAR RIVER, NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Keller reach the ridge above a river. Teyla nods to a blind.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Over there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is a blind across the river.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
A blind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
For hunting. It is well hidden. It will provide shelter for the night.</blockquote>
<p>[They arrive at a rope bridge across the river. It is literally a rope, with other ropes tied as handrails.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(worried)<br />
We're gonna&#8230;cross that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is the quickest way across.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My people built it. It is quite safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, I'm&#8230;I'm sure it is. It's just&#8230;well, my ankle. And&#8230;I've also got this&#8230;inner-ear thing? We call it vertigo. And&#8230;oh God, look at it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(biting back impatience)<br />
There comes a point in adversity when fear disappears, leaving only the will to survive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know. It's just, I don't think I'm even&#8230;remotely close to that point yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Fine. Stay here then.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla starts across the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, well, well wait! I mean, I-I'm sure I could-I could climb down and find a shallow spot in the river to cross. I mean, it might take me a little longer, but&#8212; Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[She looks out to find Teyla already half-way across the bridge. She looks around desperately]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<p>[She hesitantly starts across the bridge, talking to herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh God. Oh&#8230;Here we go. Whoo. It's perfectly safe&#8230; Perfectly safe&#8230;. Wobbly&#8212;too wobbly&#8230; Almost there.</blockquote>
<p>[As she makes her way across, her footing slips and she falls. Grabbing onto the rope with her hands, she dangles over the river. As she loses her grip, Teyla is there and pulls her back onto the bridge. They make it across together.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[They head through the woods, making their way to the blind.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Maybe your people managed to make it to the 'gate and escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
All of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I don't know, maybe. I mean, we haven't found any bodies, right? From what you've said, I doubt the Bola Kai would take the time to bury their victims.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, they do not. Because when they are done with their victims, usually very little remains.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What are you telling me, they're cannibals?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla turns slowly around.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[A jagged edged disk strikes the tree in front of Keller. She gasps. There is a Bola Kai on the ridge above them. He throws another as Teyla knocks Keller down. She takes back her knife and grabs her stick, facing three Bola Kai who circle her. Keller scrambles at her pack and comes up with a scalpel. She watches as Teyla takes down two of the Bola Kai in hand-to-hand combat. The third runs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Stay here.</blockquote>
<p>[She runs after the escaping Bola Kai.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What? Teyla? Teyla!</blockquote>
<p>[The Bola Kai runs from Teyla, but she cuts him off and strangles him with her stick.]
</p><p>[Meanwhile, Keller cautiously approaches the two downed Bola Kai. One of them begins to move. Keller grabs his short sword and backs up as he groggily gets to his feet. Teyla returns.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(to Teyla, gesturing to the warriors)<br />
That one's dead, but&#8230;he's still alive.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla takes the sword from Keller and kills the Bola Kai. Keller looks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We cannot afford to take prisoners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, we could&#8230;we could've tied him up and left him in the woods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then the others would have found him and released him to rejoin the hunt. I know it is difficult to accept, but the fewer of them, the better our chances of survival.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shakily nods. They both hear a man moaning nearby. They head towards the noise. There is a semi-conscious man lying wounded among some rocks. Keller heads to him, while Teyla looks around the area warily.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
His hands are tied. He must've been a&#8230;a prisoner. He's got a stab wound to his abdomen. Will you get me my medical kit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We have to leave him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What are you talking about? He's one of your people!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He is not Athosian.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
But his&#8230;his clothes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have never seen him before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, he's obviously not one of them, and if I don't suture his wound, he's gonna bleed to death.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
More Bola Kai will be here very soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know. But this won't take long, okay? Please?</blockquote>
<p>[The man wheezes and gasps in pain. Teyla studies him, then goes for the kit.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WOODS, NEW ATHOS, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[Keller has finished suturing the wound. She gets up and approaches Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I got the bleeding under control. If the wound doesn't get infected, he should be okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It will be dark soon. Stay here with him. I will find the blind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh, is-is it far?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves Keller and the wounded man and scouts ahead. She finds the blind and removes a branch to be sure it's save. She finds a wooden chest full of hunting traps as well.]
</p><p>[By the time she gets back to the others, it is completely dark. The nervous Keller is relieved to see her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Did you find it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. How is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Unconscious, but stable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can he be moved?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, I don't know. He shouldn't be. His condition's precarious, I would hate to&#8230;<br />
(noticing Teyla's expression)<br />
Yes, he can be moved.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HUNTING BLIND, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Keller and the man are settled in the blind. Teyla arrives with a canteen.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Water from the river.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have laid traps around the perimeter. If any Bola Kai come near, hopefully we will hear them before they discover us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How's your ankle?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
The swelling's not too bad, and the pain's eased up, thanks to the painkillers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If you wish to sleep, I can&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[There is a scuttling noise outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla silently points to where the ground is moving nearby. She moves forward with a spear. When the moving ground gets close enough, she spears a squid-like creature through the dirt.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(agape)<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Dinner. They are attracted to the warmth of our bodies.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes her knife, cuts into the creature, and pulls out some meat. She offers it to Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The taste leaves much to be desired, but it will sustain you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(disgusted)<br />
Oh, uh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You should eat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uhn, this was my least favorite part of <i>Survivor</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla eats it instead. Inside, the man starts to stir.]
</p>

It's okay. You're safe now.</blockquote>

Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Nabel Golan&#8230;of the Genii.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Genii? What are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
I was planted to work inside the Athosian community. Gather intel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What happened to them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Dead. All of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Who killed my people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Wraith. A culling. Entire settlement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not the Bola Kai?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
Bola Kai were the ones who told the Wraith about them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Bola Kai are Wraith worshippers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
I was able to escape during the attack, but I was cut off from the 'gate. Bola Kai were guarding it. They captured me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have never seen you before. How long have you lived among my people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
I only arrived a few days ago.<br />
(he turns and spots one of Keller's scanners)<br />
Where are you from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
She is a friend of mine from another world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Your equipment&#8212;it looks Ancestral.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We discovered it in our travels. We have been away for some time, trading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Trading? With who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(dangerous tone)<br />
If you are still seeking intel, then you are wasting what few breaths you have remaining. So say: "thank you for saving me", and be done with this discussion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
(swallowing)<br />
Thank you&#8230;for saving me.</blockquote>

You have not slept all night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
With people trying to kill us, and&#8230;creatures crawling around under the ground? Not to mention I'm starving.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla reaches over and offers some meat.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not that starving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It will give you strength.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It'll make me puke.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You do not believe you are capable of eating it, and so you do not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No, I think it's disgusting, and so I do not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have a friend like you, afraid to challenge himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm not afraid of challenges! I signed up to be chief of medicine on an expedition in a whole other galaxy. That's about as challenging as it gets. But eating gross food? Sorry, but that's where I draw the line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Fair enough.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller moves restlessly, then wincing, she reaches for the meat. Closing her eyes, she eats it.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
See? No puking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yet. So this "friend" of yours&#8230;one of your team members? A certain uptight astrophysicist, maybe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. Athosian. His name is Kanan. A natural leader, but he is unaware of it. Burdened by an overly cautious nature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He's more than a friend, isn't he? He's the one you were coming to see. The hot date. Sorry. It's none of my business. I should just learn to shut up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We have known each other since childhood, but only recently kindled more than a friendship. I have not told anyone yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm so sorry.</blockquote>

We have to leave.</blockquote>
<p>[They gather their gear and wake Nabel.]
</p>

Egghead! Right.</blockquote>

Okay, so&#8230;Cliff Robertson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, I know this one. Played the cowboy, right?</blockquote>

Haven't heard from them yet.</blockquote>

They're late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That doesn't sound like Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, it doesn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, she had that big, uh, feast last night. Maybe she did too much celebrating and needs to sleep it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(dryly)<br />
Yeah, that sounds like Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's give her a call. Shame!</blockquote>

What is?</blockquote>

Cliff Robertson. The villain he played, Shame.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(low)<br />
If we continue this way, we will all be captured!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Look, I'm the first to admit, I'm not very good at certain things. I'm not athletic, I can't cook, you don't even want to hear me try to play the piano. But I do think I'm a pretty good judge of character, and I know that you would never sacrifice an innocent man, not even if he was a complete stranger, to save yourself. Which means the only reason you would even suggest it would be because of me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I brought you here. This is my responsibility. If anything should happen to you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I signed up for this, all right? All of it. I may not have had any idea what I was getting into, but that makes me no different from anybody else on Atlantis.</blockquote>

(distracted)<br />
I'm glad you feel that way&#8230;</blockquote>

Oh yeah, I know, I know. Before this is all over, I'm gonna have to find all the courage I can muster.</blockquote>

What are they gonna do to us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They will try to extricate information. We must tell them nothing. Doctor Keller, the lives of everyone in Atlantis are at stake.</blockquote>

I know. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to cry.]
</p>

Where are you from?</blockquote>

Your home.</blockquote>

Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. A little town.</blockquote>

Do you have any family?</blockquote>

Just my dad. My mom died a few years back.</blockquote>

I'm sorry. You must miss him.</blockquote>

I told you, we are Athosian. And you will suffer for what you have done to our people.</blockquote>

(nonplussed)<br />
What we've done?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You murdered them, an entire village!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEADER<br />
That village was deserted when we arrived.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Deserted because it was culled by the Wraith. Wraith who were brought here by you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEADER<br />
Do you know who we are?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are Bola Kai.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEADER<br />
Then you know we are hunted by the Wraith like everyone else.</blockquote>

They said they would kill you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(whispering)<br />
You told them about Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No! I&#8230;I gave them a 'gate address to an uninhabited planet, just to throw them off. Buy us more time, like you said.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't think they're Wraith worshippers. That guy in there, he seemed genuinely surprised when you accused him of working with the Wraith. Why would he deny it if it was true? I would think that would provide an even more effective threat to get us to talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So they just happened to arrive here moments after the settlement was culled? I find that a coincidence.</blockquote>
<p>[They are distracted by a warrior running through the camp to the leader.]
</p>

Something just came through the portal. A flying ship of some kind, but it disappeared before we could do anything.</blockquote>

You two, watch them. The rest of you, get your weapons and come with me.</blockquote>

Those guys guarding the 'gate certainly didn't look Athosian.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They're Bola Kai.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's a warrior tribe, ruthless. They like picking fights, especially with tribes who are peaceful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great. Just what we need, another bad guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't worry, they're primitive. We can handle them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Define primitive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Clubs and arrows.</blockquote>

Hey, arrows can hurt!</blockquote>

Only if you're stupid enough to get hit in the ass with one.</blockquote>

Life signs?</blockquote>

All over the place, and mostly in the woods. It's hard to get a visual from up here.</blockquote>

Move back.</blockquote>
<p>[They do, and he shoots the lock.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(cautiously)<br />
Where did you get the gun?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
The Athosians were not the only ones with a hidden cache of weapons. The Bola Kai captured me before I could get to mine.</blockquote>

We need to get moving. They no doubt heard the gunfire.</blockquote>
<p>[They run out of the settlement.]

It does not appear so. I believe it is safe to rest.<br />
(to Nabel)<br />
Thank you for coming for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Well, you saved my life. I figured I'd return the favor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I thought you were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Well, I can't die yet. I have far too many questions I need answers to first.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes Teyla by surprise by hitting her in the face with his pistol, knocking her to the ground, He turns his gun to Keller.]

We can start with you giving me the 'gate address to Atlantis.</blockquote>

Why are you doing this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Just give me the address, and I'll let you go. I promise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I see you're not as badly wounded as I thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Oh, it's bad. I just have a high tolerance for pain. The address, and I'll let you go. Both of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're lying. You're not Genii, are you? We have an understanding with them. They wouldn't need to resort to these tactics in order to contact us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
(shrugging)<br />
All right, so that part wasn't true. But I was captured by the Bola Kai.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're the Wraith worshipper. You're the one responsible for the death of the Athosians.</blockquote>
<p>[He lowers his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Unless I lied about that as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What do you mean, they're not dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Give me the 'gate address, and I'll gladly tell you everything.</blockquote>
<p>[From the ground, Teyla kicks Nabel, knocking him off his feet. Now on the ground, she punches him with her tied hands, but she is still weak and crumbles. Nabel gets back on his knees and aims his pistol. Keller tackles him, struggling with him for the gun. She punches him in his wound to gain the upper hand, and is able to stand and aim the pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Don't move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Untie me.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller starts towards Teyla, but Nabel blocks her path.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Get out of the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
Give me the gun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'll shoot you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NABEL<br />
No you won't. You don't have it in you. You're a doctor, a healer&#8230;not a killer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're right, I am a healer. But first I need something to heal.</blockquote>
<p>[She shoots him in the leg. He collapses, yelling in agony. Keller runs over to Teyla and unties her. Teyla scrambles to her feet and takes the gun from Keller, aiming it at Nabel.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What happened to my people?! What happened to them?!</blockquote>
<p>[Bola Kai run into the area, surrounding them. Teyla points her pistol at them in a standoff. Shots are fired from behind the Bola Kai. The warriors scatter. Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon appear.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My people. They are gone.</blockquote>

What are you talking about? All of them? What happened?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks around for Nabel, but he has disappeared in the confusion.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Nabel! Where did he go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(shaking her head)<br />
I didn't see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who are you talking about?</blockquote>

Ack! Not arrows!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to move. C'mon!</blockquote>

Let's go!</blockquote>

</p><p>[Teyla lies in a hospital bed, dressed in scrubs. Sheppard comes to her bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, how you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am fine. Doctor Keller insists I remain in bed. She fears I have a concussion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you should listen to her. We just got back from New Athos. The Bola Kai are all gone. Must have scared them off. Rodney's got teams going out there to collect clues about what happened to your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Did you find Nabel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
Searched the entire planet. No life signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He must have escaped through the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or more likely, he's lying dead somewhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He knows what happened to my people. I will find them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know you will, and we're gonna help you. But you've got to rest and get your strength back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(determined)<br />
Whoever did this will pay. I will make certain of it.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller enters the area, checking some information on a computer. She wears an air-boot cast.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, Doc. How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, it's just a sprain. I'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why is it that you are allowed to resume working, and I am not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Because I didn't take half the beating you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have suffered worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, well, I believe you, but you're on my turf now, so you have to listen to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll check in on you later.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. Teyla stares off into space.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So&#8230;I got permission to go home for a few days of R&amp;R. God bless that intergalactic gate bridge, huh? Anyway&#8230;I get to see my dad&#8230;and I have you to thank for that.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks at Keller now, her expression sympathetic. After a moment, she moves restlessly on the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How long must I stay here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
About another day or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I told you, I feel fine. I do not have a concussion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're right. You don't. Teyla, I've looked over your test results. There's something we need to talk about.</blockquote>
