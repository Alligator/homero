</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla sit with Carter in her office.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Welcome back, Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you. Believe me, it's good to be back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, what's new on Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I&#8230;wouldn't know. I saw nothing beyond the walls of Stargate Command for two days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How'd the interview go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Exactly as you said it would. The new member of the IOA, Mister Coolidge? Was somewhat brusque and arrogant. He insisted on doing most of the questioning himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, I thought he would. These interviews were the first item on his agenda.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't worry, just a new guy marking his territory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, well, he is clearly distrustful of "aliens" participating in any aspect of the Stargate Program, let alone being active team members.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But you changed his mind, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I&#8230;hope so. Although he did seem&#8230;distracted by my current condition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(surprised)<br />
Really? I informed the IOA of your pregnancy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. They knew. And most of the members were actually quite supportive. But Mr. Coolidge&#8230;his demeanor toward women differs from his demeanor toward men. He kept calling me "honey."</blockquote>
<p>[Carter groans softly and bites her lip.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I admit the urge to inflict harm on this man was quite strong, but I managed to refrain from doing so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good call. Bad idea to run around beating the crap out of people with a baby on the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
In the end, I don't think he'll have a problem with me, mainly because I think he believes I will not be returning to active duty after my child is born.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, won't he be surprised?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shifts uncomfortably. Sheppard studies her reaction with surprise.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(quickly)<br />
Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime, it's important that we get through these interviews as smoothly as possible and not create any waves. I'll inform you when the report comes in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla leaves. Sheppard stands, but sits again when Carter sits next to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sighing)<br />
Ronon's up next.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Big waves. We're talking tsunamis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I thought about that. Now, his interview's not for three days, so I've asked somebody to come to Atlantis and&#8230;"coach" him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teal'c, wearing formal Jaffa robes, arrives through the Stargate and looks around Atlantis. Carter walks up to greet him, smiling broadly.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Teal'c!</blockquote>
<p>[They clasp hands warmly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Colonel Carter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Welcome to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c bows. Carter laughs.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Teal'c walk down a corridor. She's studying his latest hairstyle. He still has the silver streak from his aging, but it has grown longer now, and is slicked back.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So, Teal'c, the, uh&#8230;hair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
You do not like it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No, I love it. It's very&#8230;Earth.</blockquote>
<p>[They grin at each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
This city is much larger than I expected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ah, it's a remarkable feat of engineering. The Ancients really knew what they were doing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Indeed.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter smiles at passers-by and looks at the city. Teal'c studies her and gives a faint smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
You look well, Colonel Carter. Command has been good to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thanks, Teal'c. It takes some getting used to. The military protocol's pretty relaxed, but I like it here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WORKOUT ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon spars with a large Marine in hand to hand combat, Ronon constantly knocking the other down. Other Atlantis personnel are on the sidelines watching. Carter and Teal'c enter. Ronon fells the Marine for the last time, then adjusts some of his dreadlocks out of his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Is that him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yep. That's him. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon goes to get something to drink while people help the injured man off the mats. Carter and Teal'c approach Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ronon Dex, I'd like you to meet Teal'c of the Jaffa. He's the one I was telling you about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
(bowing)<br />
It is a pleasure to meet you, Ronon Dex. Colonel Carter has spoken highly of you.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon is slightly out of breath as he continues to drink his water. He studies Teal'c with a scowl.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nervously)<br />
Anyway&#8230;like I said. You two are similar in many ways, so you should have a lot in common.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Teal'c watch as Ronon spits out some of his water.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(continuing gamely)<br />
Teal'c was a member of SG-1 for over ten years, so he knows all about dealing with the IOA. Which is why I thought&#8230;he could pass along a few pointers, help you prep for the big interview.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon continues to glare at Teal'c, who studies Ronon with an appraising eye.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
(blandly)<br />
Colonel Carter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sighing weakly)<br />
Yeah?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Perhaps you could leave us to become better acquainted.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks between them.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(tensely)<br />
Sure. Have fun.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves. They continue to stare each other down.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Do you not speak, Ronon Dex?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not when I've got nothin' to say.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c blinks, considering this, then bows his head.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M4F-788, DAY</b>
</p><p>[In a desert canyon. The Wraith who was part of the lab where Todd was held walks towards the DHD. A hive ship is in the distance. He is followed by other Wraith and some soldier Wraith. One carries a large circular device, others carry tendons that are the Wraith version of cables.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
This is it. Get to work!</blockquote>
<p>[They start setting up their device and connecting it to the DHD.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Ronon sits alone at a table, eating. Teal'c arrives with his own tray full of food.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
May I join you?</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c sits without waiting for an answer. Ronon appears annoyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Mm. Salisbury steak. We are often served this in the SGC mess hall. I must confess, however, that I am partial to the tater tots.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Look. I don't need a coach teaching me how to act during the interview. I've dealt with the IOA before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
The IOA is comprised of more than just Mr. Woolsey. Their new member, Mr. Coolidge is far less pleasant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well, I can handle him. I'll stay calm, answer all of his questions. I know how to play the game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
I am pleased to hear that. Very well. Let us speak of other things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Such as?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Tell me of Sateda.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stops chewing and glares at Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(aggressively)<br />
What do you want to know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
When did the Wraith destroy it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(calming)<br />
Years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Your army was unable to fight?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(bristling)<br />
Oh, we fought back. The battle lasted days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
And when you finally surrendered, what did the Wraith do then&#8212;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(hissing)<br />
We didn't surrender! We fought until every last one of us was either dead or captured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
So tell me then&#8230;is it true that negligence on your part is what first alerted the Wraith to your presence? That your reckless actions brought about the deaths of thousands of innocent people&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stands and tosses aside his tray in his fury. He unholsters his gun and powers it up, aiming it at Teal'c's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's a lie!</blockquote>
<p>[While everyone has gotten up, upset and confused at the scene, Teal'c has remained seated, perfectly calm, and eating a tater tot.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Indeed it is. Yet, should such a question arise during your interview, I trust you will not respond in a similar manner. You do, after all, "know how to play the game."</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens and Sheppard enters, taking in the scene.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon! Put&#8230;the gun&#8230;away!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon re-holsters his gun, but continues to glare down at Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's the problem here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
There is no problem, Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's good to hear. Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon leans over the table, menacingly. Teal'c stops eating and stares back in challenge. Sheppard shifts, sensing the tension.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right&#8230;why don't you take Teal'c down to the gym? Show him your fighting techniques? I'm sure you guys could give each other a few tips.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WORK OUT ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teal'c and Ronon fight in the center of the room with large staffs. Teal'c has taken off his robes and is in sleeveless top and pants. Atlantis personnel line the edges, cheering the fighters on. Chuck has a PDA and is collecting money in a betting pool. Carter enters and walks over to Sheppard, who's watching calmly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel? Want to place a bet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What's going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Friendly sparring match.</blockquote>
<p>[They watch as Teal'c and Ronon swing their staffs. Neither seem to be holding back, and neither gives any quarter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, it looks anything but friendly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nah, it's good for them. They're just blowing off some steam.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c and Ronon continue to fight at a furious pace.]
</p>
<blockquote>CROWD<br />
Go! Go! Go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How long have they been at it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
About an hour or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(incredulous)<br />
An hour?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're not even taking any breaks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, they are now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think that's such a&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter jumps into the fray.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
&#8230;good idea.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon kicks and Teal'c's staff breaks in the middle, leaving him with two rods now. Carter steps into the fight circle.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay! That's enough!</blockquote>
<p>[The cheering stops and Teal'c and Ronon pace around. Teal'c stares at Carter, then drops his two sticks. Ronon sneers and drops his own staff. Sheppard's eyes widen.]
</p><p>[Ronon starts punching Teal'c. After a few blows, Teal'c fights back, knocking Ronon to one side. Ronon bounces to renew his attack.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ronon! Teal'c! Stop!</blockquote>
<p>[She steps between them and physically holds them apart.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Let's call it a draw.</blockquote>
<p>[The crowd dissipates. Sheppard takes some Canadian money from Chuck's hand, leaving him a small bill, then walks away himself.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Teal'c, now back in his Jaffa robes, walk down a corridor. Not in hearing distance, Sheppard walks with Ronon. He points to Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(petulantly)<br />
Why does he have to go with me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's not actually going with you. He's returning home. He just happens to be traveling at the same time. One less dial-in on the intergalactic bridge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's the other thing. Why don't we just dial Earth directly from here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we need a ZPM for that, and we don't want to waste the extra power. That was the whole point of the Gate Bridge in the first place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
But there's a twenty-four hour quarantine on the Midway Station.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon pause at the door to the Gate Room. Teal'c and Carter already stand before the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you're just going to have to sit around for a bit, all right? Look, the guy's got years of experience. He's like a hundred years old or something, all right? It won't kill you to listen to him. Be a good boy.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I hate you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'm sorry about breaking up the sparring match earlier. But if I didn't, you two would probably still be fighting.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c nods and bows.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Listen, I know that Ronon's been resistant, but I really appreciate you coming here and helping us out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I too wish him to succeed. There is great potential in him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I agree.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
All set?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Let's get this over with.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Teal'c exchange looks, she with a too-bright smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(calling to Control Room)<br />
Dial the bridge, Chuck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
It gives me great pride to see how the people of this expedition have embraced you as their leader. As I knew they would.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thanks, Teal'c.</blockquote>
<p>[They embrace. Ronon rolls his eyes and looks away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M4F-788, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activates as the Wraith recheck the tendon cables.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH AIDE<br />
The portal's activating. The patterns are stored in the buffer. The portal should redial momentarily.</blockquote>
<p>[The aide presses controls.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Midway Station floats between the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Incoming Pegasus Activation.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teal'c and Ronon step onto the ramp. Two guards stand nearby. The Milky Way Stargate is at the the other side of the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Lee watches Teal'c and Ronon through a window. Kavanaugh and Dempster sit at separate control consoles.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(to Kavanaugh)<br />
Right on schedule. I'm gonna go get them settled in. You can get started on the attitude stabilization diagnostics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
I thought Dempster was doing that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DEMPSTER<br />
Why do I have to do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
You don't. I want you to do it.</blockquote>
<p>[He points at Kavanaugh.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
I just finished five hours of power distribution upgrades!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
You chose to be here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
No, I didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Yes, you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
No, I didn't!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Regardless&#8230;I want you to learn everything there is to know about this station. And the sooner you do that, the sooner I get to hand you reins and go home.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
(petulant)<br />
You're not the only one who wants to go home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(calling back)<br />
I heard that!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Lee meets Teal'c and Ronon in the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(brightly)<br />
Gentlemen! Welcome to the Midway Station, halfway point between the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, we know. We've been here before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(nervously)<br />
Right. Of course. So then you also know about the twenty-four hour quarantine before we can let you carry on to Earth? Don't want to pass on any of those pesky Pegasus germs to the folks back home&#8230;<br />
(clears throat)<br />
Why-why don't I just show you to your quarters? Um, unfortunately, you're gonna have to share. As you know, there's not much room on the station.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION GUEST QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Lee opens a door. It has a bunk-bed, a small table, a toilet and sink. Teal'c looks around practically in horror at how small it is. Ronon looks annoyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
There's a dvd player and a few movies. Oh, we saw <i>Norbit</i> the other day? It's actually&#8212;it's kind of funny. Um, there's some sudoku books&#8230;although I think&#8212;no, they're all solved. Um, yeah, like I said, it-it-it's a bit small, but uh, you're only here for a day, so kick back, relax, have a-have an Earl Grey and get to know each other better&#8230;or not.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee is squeezed between the much larger Teal'c and Ronon. As they look at their cramped quarters, Lee is pressed between them while he speaks. Lee is able to maneuver to the door and makes a hasty retreat. Ronon and Teal'c glare at each other a few moments, then both move to take the bottom bunk. They stand as one and stare each other down again.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M4F-788, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith aide finishes typing on his console.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH AIDE<br />
I have deciphered the program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Prepare the first wave!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Lee rejoins Kavanaugh and Dempster.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
How's it going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
(dully)<br />
Peachy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
You're bored. I get it. Welcome to Midway.</blockquote>
<p>[The Pegasus Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Are we expecting another dial-in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to Dempster's console and keys the intercom.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Unscheduled Pegasus activation.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at the computer screen of a camera at the Stargate and watches the two guards wait. Wraith soldiers come through the Stargate and immediately fire at the guards.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
What the heck?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Oh, God! Wraith!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
That's impossible!</blockquote>
<p>[They all rush to the window to see several Wraith soldiers coming through the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION GUEST QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teal'c stand stoically and watch the Three Stooges on the tv screen mounted to the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MOE<br />
(on screen)<br />
Ah, who you hitting?</blockquote>
<p>[Moe hits Larry between the eyes. Larry runs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>CURLY<br />
(on screen)<br />
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MOE<br />
Eh, be quiet.</blockquote>
<p>[Moe smacks Curly up the back of the head.]
</p><p>[Neither Ronon nor Teal'c react to the onscreen antics. A klaxon begins to blare. Ronon and Teal'c exchange looks. Ronon grabs his gun belt from the top bunk, and Teal'c takes off his robe as they leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Wraith soldiers patrol the halls, shooting the guards. Ronon and Teal'c encounter two soldiers; Ronon instantly fells them with his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What are the Wraith doing here?</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c picks up their stunner weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
I was about to ask the same question.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The blast shield closes over the window. The door opens and Wraith enter. Lee finishes frantically typing on the console while the other two raise their hands.]
</p>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What did you do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
I shut it off using the critical systems bypass.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Lee look at Kavanaugh in horror.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you out of your mind?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
What? It worked!</blockquote>
<p>[The self-destruct alarm starts to blare.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(terrified)<br />
Oh my God. The self destruct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
I didn't mean&#8212;I&#8230;I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did you not just hear me say I need to figure out a safe workaround to avoid any commands that may have been compromised? As in booby-trapped? Look, I didn't use the bypass to shut down the 'gate for this very reason!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard climbs down a ladder into another corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've made a terrible mistake! We never should've revived Kavanaugh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(horrified)<br />
He triggered the self-destruct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Not on purpose!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(tightly)<br />
That doesn't really matter now, does it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(checking his watch, fighting to stay calm)<br />
All right, we've got just under ten minutes before this whole station blows up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, can you turn it off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. We're completely locked out. The Wraith made sure if they couldn't have this station, then no one could.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(shuddering breath)<br />
Oh, things couldn't get any worse.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear blasts just outside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Wraith soldiers shoot at the door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
They're shooting at the door.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teal'c and Ronon search the corridor. They hear a noise in one room. They move to it and burst inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teal'c find IOA members slumped unconscious in a secondary conference room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Wait.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c moves over. Coolidge has fallen out of his chair, but the movement has awakened him (or vice versa). He struggles to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Coolidge blinks at Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Ronon Dex, this is Mr. Coolidge of the IOA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh. Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
You were rendered unconscious by a Wraith stun device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
What? There are Wraith? Here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
They have infiltrated the base. It is best if you remain in this room until Ronon Dex and I have neutralized the situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
No, no, no. We need to get to the control room, radio for help.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon puts his hand out and steps in Coolidge's path.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We don't need help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
How many Wraith are here on this base?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
We do not know exact numbers, but there are many.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
And who else beside you are going after them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
We are the only two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
Get me to a radio!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's better if we&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
Now!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard hides in a room as soldiers storm through the corridor outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've got an idea, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the two locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great, because we've got Wraith just about to blast through the door.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This place has got a puddle jumper docked here, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, to be used as an emergency escape pod.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reloads his rifle.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I'd say this pretty much qualifies&#8230;as an emergency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(stammering)<br />
No, no, no, no! We'll be stuck out here in the middle of the galactic void!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They'll mount a rescue. It might take a couple of weeks, but the jumper is stocked with food and water. We should be all right, unless you want to stay here and get blown to smithereens with the rest of the station. Your call!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
We've got one other problem. How we going to get there?</blockquote>
<p>[Lee and McKay look stumped&#8230;and worried.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard rounds a corner, timing it right to shoot and kill several Wraith. He runs and finds the strike force, all dead and fed upon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, we're out of time. Vent the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between here and Sheppard's location.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Every room but the control room. Vent the air.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How close are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't wait for me, just do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can you make it to the jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. I'll try.</blockquote>
<p>[He breaks into a run.]
</p><p>[In the control room, Lee and McKay look horrified.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
John, I'm not sure there's time to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sharply)<br />
We don't have time to argue! Do it!</blockquote>
<p>[The blasting continues to sound outside the door of the control room, becoming even more intense. Lee licks his lips nervously and taps Rodney on the shoulder in encouragement.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Venting the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<p>[He types controls to vent the oxygen.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[The air is sucked out of the station. The Wraith soldiers struggle, but quickly lose their breath and fall. In one corridor, Sheppard struggles from the wind caused by the air being blown out, trying to reach the jumper. He is tackled by the head Wraith. They struggle; Sheppard is able shoot the Wraith with his pistol. Sheppard moves only a small way across the floor before running out of breath and stopping, face down.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR, LEVEL 28</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teal'c shoot several Wraith trying to open the elevator doors to the shaft. Coolidge follows, keeping his head ducked from bullet casings. He ducks for cover as the firefight ensues, finally running away. Finally all the Wraith are downed by Ronon and Teal'c.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(gesturing two directions from the corridor)<br />
I'll go this way, you go that way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Where is Mr. Coolidge?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(glancing around)<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<p>[They split up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Kavanaugh listens at the door. The self-destruct continues to count down. Lee looks at the surveillance monitors.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
It's pretty quiet out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(looking at the security camera display)<br />
Looks like they're all dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, can you hear me?&#8230;John, are you there?</blockquote>
<p>[The two stunned marines finally awaken. Kavanaugh helps them to their feet. McKay keeps listening for Sheppard to respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(quietly)<br />
It should be enough time. I think it's safe to re-pressurize&#8230;Doctor McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shakily)<br />
Yeah&#8230;re-pressurizing the station.</blockquote>
<p>[He types some controls, his face a mask of grief.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon runs in. He finds Coolidge standing by a control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
I've contacted the military. They're fully aware of the situation, which means, unfortunately, they're preparing to nuke the base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?!</blockquote>
<p>[Some of the control room personnel are beginning to awaken; they get up groggily.]
</p>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
Stargate Command has been compromised! The only way to fully prevent the Wraith from infiltrating the general population is to destroy it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(fiercely)<br />
Well, tell them to call it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
I can't do that. Not as long as there's a single Wraith is still alive on this base!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Wraith?! What, here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Listen, we'll deal with the Wraith. Look, you've still got people alive here. Buy us some more time!</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
We don't have time. Look, there's an escape hatch to the surface. We need to get to it immediately. Where's Teal'c?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon glances at the security monitors. Teal'c is trapped in a corridor, Wraith shooting at him from both sides.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He's surrounded. I need to get back to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
No. No time! We have to leave as soon as we can!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not without Teal'c.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
We can't go back for him! We could get bogged down or killed!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon leaves. Coolidge follows calling after him.]
</p>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
Now, there's a clear path to the escape hatch, and we need to get out of here, now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(spinning, furious)<br />
You want to run away and save yourself? Fine! I'm staying here.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Kavanaugh, Lee and the two marines climb down a ladder to the corridor near the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The jumper bay is&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Through the EVA prep room. And it's not a real bay though. It's more like an airlock that leads to a hatch that's cut into the top&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatient)<br />
I don't need the blueprints! Where is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Kavanaugh points. Lee points too, with his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
It's over there&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay lowers Lee's gun arm and cuts ahead, anxious to look for Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION EVA PREP ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The door to the room opens. McKay motions for Lee to come forward. He moves to a large hatchway door.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Through here.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee enters the combination to the airlock on the electronic keypad. Kavanaugh pushes Lee aside to be the first one through. Resigned, Lee follows, followed by the two marines. McKay is the last to go, but pauses upon hearing one of the EVA suit's regulators hissing. He approaches and turns on the active suit's helmet light. Sheppard is semi-conscious inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
Sheppard?! How the hell did you&#8212;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(weakly)<br />
Get me out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts to unlock his helmet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teal'c guns down two Wraith, turns and shoots a third, trying to move through. He guns down another Wraith, then pauses, sensing for the next attack. A Wraith comes out of one of the closed doors and tackles him from the side. Ronon shoots two other Wraith trying to ambush Teal'c, but gets distracted by a Wraith behind him.]
</p><p>[Teal'c and Ronon both deal hand-to-hand with individual Wraith. Teal'c is caught off-guard by his enemy and thrown across the hallway into the section wall. He collapses. Ronon is able to get away from his guard and grabs a section of pipe from the ceiling. Wielding it like a bantos stick, he clubs the Wraith.]
</p><p>[The Wraith soldier pins Teal'c against the wall and feeds on him for a moment. He screams in pain. The Wraith is impaled by Ronon's broken section of pipe. He falls to the floor dead as Ronon stands behind him. Teal'c catches his breath and wipes his bloody lip.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
(weakly)<br />
Excellent timing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Indeed.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c nods in gratitude and slowly moves forward. Ronon claps him on the back.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, I think that's all of them.</blockquote>
<p>[Teal'c looks around.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
(hoarsely)<br />
I certainly hope you are correct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We got to call the military. They're going to blow this place up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Lee looks worriedly at the ceiling airlock.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
What's taking him so long?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
(checking watch)<br />
The self-destruct's about to blow! Twenty seconds!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay drops into the jumper, followed immediately by Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Colonel Sheppard! How did you&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatient)<br />
Later! We're leaving. Sit down!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins McKay in the cockpit.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper powers up and flies away seconds before the station explodes.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The IOA committee sit together at one side of the table. Ronon sits facing them.]
</p>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
Ronon Dex&#8230;do you feel that you can fulfill the duties of an SG team member with diligence, integrity, and respect for those in authority over you?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon slowly leans close to the microphone in front of him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon leans back. Coolidge looks to his fellow committee members.]
</p>
<blockquote>COOLIDGE<br />
(smiling)<br />
Good enough for me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks at them, surprised, then turns in his chair.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teal'c waits outside the door for Ronon to exit. Ronon opens the door and walks out, closing the door behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Well?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm exactly the kind of team member they want out there fighting the Wraith. Their words, not mine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
And you did not hold a weapon to their heads?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I did not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
(smiling)<br />
I am pleased.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(smiling, shrugging)<br />
Yeah, well, I had a good coach.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Indeed. The <i>Daedalus</i> is preparing to leave. Colonel Caldwell will beam you aboard when you are ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(concerned)<br />
Still nothing from Midway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
No. We have lost all contact with them. The <i>Daedalus</i> will stop on its way back to Atlantis to assess the situation.</blockquote>
<p>[As they walk, Ronon appears worried.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper floats in the void between the Milky Way Galaxy and Pegasus Galaxy.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Kavanaugh and Lee hold playing cards and sit on the floor of the jumper. The marines sit on the benches and McKay sits on the floor&#8212;the trio look bored.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
No way. You actually <i>liked</i> it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
It's his finest film.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
<i>Pearl Harbor</i>?</blockquote>
<p>[Lee turns to the others for support, looking incredulous.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Yeah, go ahead and mock it, everybody does. But that film will endure. It's got weight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Yeah, which is why it plummeted at the box office!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Two hundred million dollars domestic? That's not plummeting, I beg to differ.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(fuming, talking over Kavanaugh)<br />
Enough already! We've been stuck here for god knows how long, and you haven't shut up, either of you! You just keep talking and tal-tal-talk-talk-talk-talk!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay natters into silence, his arms expressing his frustration. There is a loud metallic clank outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Something just hit us.</blockquote>
<p>[The door starts to open and they struggle to their feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stands outside in the <i>Daedalus</i> hangar bay with two <i>Daedalus</i> crew members.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Wha-where are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, 302 bay. We saw you, scooped you up. We're heading back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Thank God.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to hug Ronon, but Ronon pushes him against the jumper bulkhead. Lee slaps Ronon on the back. Ronon walks up to McKay as the marines leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sadly)<br />
Midway was destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, we saw. Where's Sheppard?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens the door to the pilot cabin. Sheppard lounges asleep in the pilot chair, facing the rear compartment with headphones over his ears.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lasted about a day, sealed himself in there.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes and leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No wonder he didn't hear the radio call.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon approaches Sheppard and taps him on the cheek. Sheppard, still asleep, bats Ronon's hand away. Ronon smiles and tweaks Sheppard's nose. Sheppard bats him again. Fighting laughter, Ronon tries again. Sheppard starts awake.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mwhah!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank God!<br />
(pointing to rear compartment)<br />
I almost shot myself with a stunner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah. I understand.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard groans, taking off his headphones and looking out the window.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
<i>Daedalus</i> 302 bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's the status of SGC?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Secure. Teal'c and I took care of the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I figured you would.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(beckoning)<br />
Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon starts walking out. Sheppard follows, picking up his vest as he leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh, and I, uh, passed my interview with the IOA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah. They said they liked me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what's not to like?</blockquote>
