<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[Excerpts from 4.08 "The Seer"  and 4.10 "This Mortal Coil Part 1" are shown.]
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard paces the room. Ronon sits on the staircase to the jumper bay. Both are geared up for an offworld mission.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't worry. We're ahead of schedule.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All the settlements we've been assigned have been evacuated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know, I know. It's just that most of the planets that are in the Replicators path are people that we've had almost no contact with, so I need you and Teyla out there as much as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well I think it might be the flu. She's been looking a little green lately.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla enters, geared up for an offworld mission.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm fine. Where are we going to now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
M9R-373.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
The Massanians. This should be interesting.</blockquote>
<p>[They start heading to the stairwell leading to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I'm sorry we're having to go out so much. I know you don't feel so hot, but you're the one with al the contacts out there, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's all right. I'm feeling much better now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Offworld activation!</blockquote>
<p>[They watch from the top of the stairwell as refugees start to come through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Must be Lieutenant Kemp's team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Receiving video transmission. Coming in now, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and the others head back to the control room monitor, where Kemp appears on screen, crouching to lean into view of the MALP camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lieutenant, looks like things are going well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
(over video)<br />
Most of the settlement's on their way through, but a good number of them have decided to stay behind. I'm not sure they believe us, sir. I'm requesting Teyla come back and try to talk some sense into the stragglers, because I'm not getting anywhere with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I don't think we can do that. The Replicator ship's going to be there within a half-hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
(over video)<br />
Well, I don't know what to do. They&#8212;<br />
(calling out)<br />
Incoming!</blockquote>
<p>[An explosion happens nearby, covering Kemp with dirt. He leans closer to the camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
(panicked, into video)<br />
It's too late! They're already here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried)<br />
Lieutenant, get your men through the 'gate!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KEMP<br />
(over video)<br />
I can't! There's too many people&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The transmission cuts off. The Stargate shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
We've lost the transmission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dial him back.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck dials, but the Stargate does not activate.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
I can't get a lock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They must've taken out the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How many people were left on that settlement?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just under two thousand.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange distraught looks.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> and <i>Apollo</i> come out of hyperspace above the New Atlantis world.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter stands with McKay and Sheppard in the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Both ships at the same time. This is a first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's the first time we've needed them.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay shoot her a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(abashed)<br />
Well&#8230;since I've been here.</blockquote>
<p>[She grimaces. Ellis and Caldwell beam into the control room, facing each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(to Ellis)<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(to Caldwell)<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(to Carter)<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to Ellis and Caldwell)<br />
Colonels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ellis and Caldwell)<br />
Colonels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(ignoring McKay, to colonels)<br />
Good flight?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Long flight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll make it worth your while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
That's what I hear. You have a way of tracking the Replicator ships?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
That'll make finding and destroying them a lot easier.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Why don't you come into my office? We'll get you briefed.</blockquote>
<p>[She leads the way.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[McKay shows several lines of code on a computer monitor. Everyone looks bored.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is this recent discovery of the essential duality of this particular stem of the nano-sub-code that has opened up a whole new world of possibilities when it comes to the expedient and permanent deactivation of the inter-nanite bonds&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I-I'll let you know when I'm ready to take questions. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Have you created an anti-Replicator weapon or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If-if you just let me continue, I-I think you'll have a better understanding of the complexity that I'm&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(impatient)<br />
Yes or no, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;no.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter clears her throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right, we move onto Plan B.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, just like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The Replicators are destroying every human colony they can find in an attempt to wipe out the Wraith's food supply. We can't wait. We have to act now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But Plan B, it's not a good plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Oh no?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sure, the <i>Apollo</i> and the <i>Daedalus</i> have been retrofitted with the new Asgard plasma beam weapons, which given are very, very powerful, but they still can't destroy the Replicators.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, we don't have to destroy them, we just destroy their ships. I mean, from what I understand, once they're exposed to the harsh environment of space&#8230;they'll essentially be neutralized.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellis nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, "essentially neutralized" and "neutralized" are two very different things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Back when we blasted Niam into space, he froze solid. We didn't have a problem until <i>we</i> warmed him up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's what I'm saying! Look, your way leaves Replicator cells inactive, just waiting around for someone to reactivate them. My way shuts them down for good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
But our way is actually operational. You know, come to think of it, what exactly <i>is</i> your way? From what I understand, you haven't even gotten your programming done yet, let alone a delivery method.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you didn't let me finish my presentation.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches for the remote.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
I think I got the gist of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(affronted)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(angry)<br />
No, no, I'm just wondering when the Colonel here became a math and physics expert!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Doctor, you came into this meeting knowing that you had nothing. But instead of just saying that like a man, you thought that you'd dazzle us with a lot of fancy talk and think that we were too dumb to notice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, so now you're questioning my manhood?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right, that is enough!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No! He just told&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;! Move on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I think we've got this tracking system down. We can peg where they're going to be within a thirty minute window. And given current data, we've got at least twelve hours before any of their ships are even close to an inhabited planet. Just give me and the Wraith like&#8230;ten hours to get this shut-down program working. If I don't, then you can just feel free to go ahead and open up on them with your "beam weapons."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right. You have ten hours. Go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shuts off the monitor and leaves with a final glare at Ellis. After he's gone, Ellis turns to Sheppard and Caldwell and shakes his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
I don't understand how you guys put up with&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter gets in Ellis's face, staring him down.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
If you ever talk like that to someone under my command again, you will not be welcome on this base, Colonel. Is that clear?</blockquote>
<p>[Ellis studies Carter, then nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Yes, it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Good. We're done here. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on his equipment. The Wraith stands nearby, under guard. It is the Wraith who will later be named Todd.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Why would you lie to them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(protesting)<br />
I didn't lie to them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
It is most improbable that we complete our task within ten hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That is quitter talk! Look, you don't know me. This is when I'm at my best, this is when I shine! Impossible deadlines! Did I ever tell you about the time that I once got a damaged Ancient hyperdrive system online moments before me and my crew were incinerated by a super-volcano?</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith rolls his eyes and sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Yes, you have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there you go. See, I work best under pressure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Then perhaps I should threaten to feed on you if we do not complete the coding in time.</blockquote>
<p>[He looms menacingly over McKay. The guards raise their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Easy, easy. He's just kidding.<br />
(to Wraith)<br />
Just, tell 'em you were joking.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith stares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[He moves over to the other side of the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(meekly)<br />
I'll work in this area.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith and McKay continue to work. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Time's up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? So soon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess that means you're not ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, no, I'm not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we're going with Plan B. You want to go for a ride?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no I'll stay here. This still needs to get done. Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Apollo</i> and<i>Daedalus</i> exit hyperspace in tandem.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Ellis sits on the bridge. Marks is at the starboard station, Sheppard is at port.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, this is the <i>Apollo</i>. Our scans are clear. We don't have any other contacts. Can you confirm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Copy that, we have the same reading.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell sits in his chair. The starboard station is occupied by Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(to Carter)<br />
Colonel, how long before our guest arrives?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Should be any second now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Won't they be surprised.<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're going weapons hot, <i>Apollo</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over radio)<br />
Copy that, we have done the same.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
I'm detecting a hyperspace window opening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Stand by to fire forward beam weapons.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[An "Aurora-class" Replicator ship exits hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Fire!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Both 304 ships fire on the enemy vessel, blasting it apart.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Contact has been neutralized.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ellis exchange surprised looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I wish I'd had these a few years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, the first attack was easy. They didn't know we were coming. The Replicators have proven very effective in changing strategies when faced with failure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Still, we took that ship down without even breaking a sweat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Right. One down&#8230;thirty-seven to go.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>One week later.</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell exits an elevator. Sheppard meets him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Welcome back, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Was in the neighborhood. Thought I'd stop by and resupply.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it going out there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Splitting us up was a good call. The <i>Daedalus</i> has downed another three ships.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ellis got another two. That brings us to seven. That's not bad at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'll need about an hour to get what we need. Then we'll get back out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, there's been a little change of plans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Ellis is on a video feed. Carter, McKay, Sheppard, and Caldwell all stand in the office.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over video, surprised)<br />
They're falling back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Safety in numbers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Evidently, they haven't figured out how we're tracking them, and&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or they haven't figured out how to stop us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Either way, they want to stop losing ships.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So they're all heading back to the Replicator homeworld?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over video)<br />
Well, that's good. I mean, they're finally all in one place. We can wipe them all out at once.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ideally, yes. But our two ships versus an entire Replicator fleet&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not to mention the drones they'll be firing from the surface.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Look, the new weapons we have are very effective, but they are no match for that kind of firepower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over video)<br />
Well, sounds like the perfect time to finally use that killer program you've been working on, Doctor.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter's expression blanks. McKay looks nervous.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Remember when you said all you needed was&#8212;ten hours to finish it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Vaguely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Well, it's been ten hours&#8212;and a week. Are you finished?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm just, um, dotting some "i's", crossing some "t's"&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(cutting in)<br />
Look, whatever our plan is, we need to act quickly. Our current intel suggests that they're putting all their resources into building new ships. I figure we have less than a week before they head back out into the galaxy, and in much greater numbers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
If they start traveling in packs, our kill rate's going to drop drastically.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We can't let that happen. We need to take them out while they're all in one place, and we need to do it quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks to McKay. He suddenly realizes their attention is on him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I should&#8230;just get back to my lab.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay exits.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and the Wraith watch a monitor showing a simulation process. When completed, the result shows the simulation failed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(despondent)<br />
Oh. I have to tell them. I have to tell them we don't have anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
This is most troubling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ellis is going to love this. I-I don't get it. We tried reconfiguring their stand-down code. We tried programming the nanites to turn themselves off. Something should have worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
They are a very complex and ingenious design.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well I thought I was ingeniouser.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith gives McKay a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I know that's not a word, Mister&#8230;Helpful. All right, look, maybe we could figure out some way to use the anti-replicator guns somehow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
From what you have told me, they've almost certainly become immune to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Even if they haven't, we'd still have to get them all in one place.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is suddenly struck by inspiration. The Wraith notices.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted)<br />
I think I've got my first good idea in three weeks.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks away, leaving the Wraith there.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[McKay briefs Carter and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Our old anti-replicator technology relied on disrupting the bonds between each individual nanite cell. They just, uh, collapsed in a pile of dust, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're familiar with the technology, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. Well, the thinking was always to continue down that line, to uh, break the bonds, to turn them off, uh, sever their connections to one another. Because dust we can deal with, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We do the opposite! Instead of severing their connections, we significantly dial up their attraction to one another. We turn each cell into an incredibly powerful nanite magnet. You know, one cell attracts another cell; those two attract two more. And as more and more nanite cells, uh, bond to the core group, they become stronger and stronger and stronger. To the point where every Replicator cell on the planet, in orbit, all of them, are massed in this-in this-in this giant, super-dense blob.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at them expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A super dense blob? That's your great idea?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is. Yes, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So what do we do with the blob, then? Aren't we in danger of creating some Godzilla-sized Super-Replicator?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
No. At least not at first. Look, this is not their normal form of bonding. I mean, it'll take them some time to adapt, to-to figure out how to function within the new parameters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How much time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I mean, I'd hate to speculate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, since when?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, it doesn't matter anyways, because long before that happens, they're going to fuse together so tightly, they will be rendered essentially inert. Remember, this bond is occurring on a subspace level&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter stands, intrigued.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Which helps them get past the normal repulsive force between nuclei&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
To the point where their electrons are fusing with their protons, and once that starts happening, they're toast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but you're talking about neutron star levels of density.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Precisely!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter blinks, thinking through the idea.]

You don't mess around, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
All this is based on information provided by a Replicator? We have no reason to trust it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not trusting it; we're trusting&#8230;Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now, this causes a slightly new wrinkle in the plan. I'll need to beam down to the core room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Along with Ronon and a squad of marines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
From there, I should be able to hack into their systems and set the ZPMs to overload.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
In the meantime, we'll be keeping their ships occupied. The seven hives will space themselves around the planet equally, and our smaller ships will fill in the holes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
We could use you in my chair, Sheppard. We have an arsenal of drones, but none of my guys can fire them quite like you can.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter glances over at Sheppard who shrugs in self-deprecating manner, looking uncomfortable.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No place I'd rather be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
The hives will be dispatching sizable waves of darts to target the Replicators' hyperdrive engines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
My 302s will join you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now, while I'm working in the core room, we'll beam Fran down to the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Wait a minute&#8212;Fran?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Friendly Replicator Android?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(warningly)<br />
I didn't notice we were naming things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It noticed that, uh, Zelenka and I both had names, and, um&#8230;and she asked for one.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Sheppard exchange looks.]

All right. Let's move out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Wow. That's quite a sight!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I remember when the cold war ended, and we started doing joint missions with the Russians. I thought <i>that</i> was strange.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I've got confirmation from the fleet. We're ready to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Set coordinates for the Replicator homeworld.</blockquote>

This is quite exciting, isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(warily)<br />
It's a bit&#8230;nerve-wracking. Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FRAN<br />
I quite look forward to it.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka looks on nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FRAN<br />
One always wishes to fulfill one's purpose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. And you're&#8230;fine with all this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FRAN<br />
Why would I not be? It's my reason for being.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I know, it's just that you're&#8230;you're gonna&#8230;cease to be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FRAN<br />
Yes&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I-I just imagine you'd&#8230;rather keep being than&#8230;uh, than not.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka backs away further.]
</p>
<blockquote>FRAN<br />
Certainly you're not worried for me, are you, Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, that would be silly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FRAN<br />
(placidly)<br />
Yes, it would.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay joins Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low, to Zelenka)<br />
I should never have given it speech.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(disturbed)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over radio)<br />
Doctor McKay, we're approaching our target. You need to get with Ronon and the marines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
On my way.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to leave.]

Doctor McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatiently)<br />

<p>[They all look at her curiously. She closes her eyes and concentrates. Their curiousity turns to alarm as they disintegrate and their nanites swarm onto Fran.]

It's working, just hold those ships off a little longer.</blockquote>

What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Replicator mass. It's so heavy, it's sinking into the planet's surface.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
McKay, according to our readings, every Replicator nanite is now part of the mass. Can you confirm?</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Copy that, Sam. I'll set the countdown, and we should be&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[All the power shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Did you do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
No&#8230;It's the mass. It's collapsed the subterranean power grid. It's a black out. We're not going to be able to overload the ZPMs.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The mass of Replicator nanites undulates, striking randomly at the Asuras buildings as waves sway back and forth.]

(panicking)<br />
Not good. Not good. Not good!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(over radio)<br />
Do you want me to beam down there and help you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
The power grid's been destroyed. There's nothing either of us can do!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM, LARRIN'S SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
What's the big deal? You can't overload ZPM's. Why don't we just send some nukes down there and get this over with?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
It's not as simple as that!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Look, in order to implode a mass this large, then the explosion has to be timed down to the nanosecond. The force needs to be exactly right&#8230;I mean, you can't just fire a few nukes down here and get the job done.</blockquote>
<p>[The room rocks again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, it's got to be better than nothing!</blockquote>

</p><p><i>[The conversation continues to switch between Sheppard's location the Asuras core room, and the bridge.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I have to agree.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
McKay, my sensors indicate that the ground around the mass is rich with neutronium.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Neutronium?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the base raw material of Replicator cells. It makes all the sense in the world why the Ancients would set up on a planet where it's abundant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
This could be very useful. Neutronium is incredibly dense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And that helps us how?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sam, we are geniuses!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing)<br />
Okay, the mass is so superheavy, that it's sinking into the planet's surface. If I dial it up just a little bit, it'll attract the neutronium and sink all the way to the core.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And the planet will exert enough pressure on it to cause an implosion.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORE ROOM</b>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(typing furiously into his hand-held computer)<br />
Just give me one more&#8230;got it!</blockquote>

Um&#8230;we need to get out of here.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.</blockquote>

We should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point immediately. The planet's become unstable.</blockquote>

Yeah, but still&#8230;you gonna stick around and let my guys check this place out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
They already gave us a head start when they got us battle ready. Besides, I have some things that need to get taken care of.</blockquote>

Yeah, like&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Well, nothing for you to concern your pretty little head with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, um&#8230;now that we're allies and stuff, I should probably have some way of-of contacting you&#8230;you know, for professional reasons&#8212;in case we need help again.</blockquote>

I know where Atlantis is now. Don't worry. I'll stay in touch.</blockquote>

Colonel Sheppard, are you ready to beam?</blockquote>

Good seeing you again.</blockquote>

Welcome back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good to be back. How are our good friends, the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they never showed up at the rendezvous point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm. You think they got caught in the explosion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I doubt it. Or, I guess they just figured that there was nothing left to talk about. So as soon as the planet blew up, we were back to being enemies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm. Wraith back to being enemies. Replicators don't exist anymore. You're out of your dry spell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All is right with the world. What are you working on, anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You'll be surprised to hear that, uh, removing a planet from the database is actually a lot of work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(dryly)<br />
I thought you'd be pretty good at that by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You just can't resist bringing up the fact that I once accidentally destroyed a couple of planets, can you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It was an entire solar system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
You want to do the honors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nah, go ahead.</blockquote>

All right. M7R-227, you were a constant pain in the ass, it's good to see you go.</blockquote>

If only it were that easy in real life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. Area 51 is working on it. You want to get a&#8230;late dinner?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Absolutely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. I would've loved to seen Ellis's face when my plan worked. He's such a tool.</blockquote>
