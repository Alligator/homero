<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla head into a village. A man sees them coming and rushes to meet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Praise the gods, you've finally arrived!<br />
(he looks Teyla up and down)<br />
And you are far more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon places his hand on his holstered gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
You have not come for the arranged marriage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
(hopeful)<br />
Would you perhaps be seeking a husband?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(firmly)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Oh. Then&#8230;what brings you to our town?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We've heard of strangers who recently arrived, a rough-looking group boasting of many Wraith kills?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, we think they might be Satedan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Ah yes, you mean the three loud-mouthed drunkards who spend their days carousing at the tavern?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sounds like my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
They've taken rooms at the local in..</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
You are most welcome. And should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stalks toward the man. Intimidated, the man backs off and runs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right. I'll check the inn, You check the tavern.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Sounds good.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Teyla enters the tavern. Everyone notices her but keeps to themselves. She approaches the barkeep.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hello. I'm looking for three individuals who recently arrived. I've heard they are&#8230;voracious eaters and&#8230;drinkers, and apparently, they've been quite vocal about their recent successes against the Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Tyre, who's been standing at the bar, overhears.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
These people you're looking for&#8230;they're either very brave, or very stupid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Well, if word of their bragging got back to the Wraith, it could be very bad for them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I doubt they need to fear Wraith overhearing their conversation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Of course not. But the Wraith don't always need their own ears to hear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(exasperated)<br />
Do you know the people whom I seek?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Sorry. I mind my own business, which is something <i>you</i> might want to consider.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(assertively)<br />
And you might want to consider offering your unsolicited advice to someone who actually cares to receive it.</blockquote>
<p>[She turns to go. Tyre grabs her arm. She stares at him, surprised by his gall.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
An attitude like that could get you hurt, or worse.</blockquote>
<p>[She strikes at him. They exchange blows. A man and woman sitting at a nearby table get up and approach the fight. Tyre kicks at Teyla, but she ducks under it to find herself being attacked by the others. Tyre stands back and lets his friends take care of matters. They're able to pin Teyla against the bar and the woman Ara holds a knife to her throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
What's the first to go? The ears, or those pretty eyes?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon's pistol is heard powering up behind her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How 'bout your head?</blockquote>
<p>[Shocked, the trio turn to the door where Ronon stands. He lowers his weapon and looks equally shocked.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(happy)<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ara, Rakai!</blockquote>
<p>[Ara runs to Ronon, quickly embracing him. Rakai releases Teyla and joins in with a bear hug. Tyre follows. They all laugh and cheer. Teyla stares at the group in disbelief and tests her jaw from the blows she suffered.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka approaches a room. McKay is leaving and spots him as he passes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Heard the rumor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No. What rumor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka turns around and starts to follow McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Wait, what is this about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, it would be irresponsible for me to say anything&#8230; All right, look if you're gonna twist my arm, the IOA have made their final decision. They've, uh, chosen the new leader of Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, who is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there's been no formal announcement, but, uh, word is they're going with their foremost expert in Ancient technology and Replicator activity. Who does that sound like to you?</blockquote>
<p>[He points to himself as he speaks. Zelenka has been lost in thought and doesn't notice. However, he soon reaches his own conclusion of who McKay expects.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Who else?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, I heard they were leaning towards someone with a science background&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And why not? It's about time that one of us ended up in a position of real power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, oh. And by "us", you mean&#8230;"you".</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<p>[Musing, he stops walking, as does Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's kind of scary though. You know, I'll be making decisions that don't affect just the city, but the entire galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, scary. Very scary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
On the other hand, a leader never second-guesses himself. I'm up for the challenge. I know I am. I'm going to make them proud. Radek, I'm going to make you proud.</blockquote>
<p>[He clicks his tongue as he points to Zelenka and walks off. Zelenka stands staring after McKay looking very worried.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is at one of the stations, talking on a video link. Carter is on the other end, talking from the SGC control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comm)<br />
The, uh, Wraith-Replicator war is in full swing. From what I hear, the Replicators are kicking some serious ass in their last offensive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(over comm)<br />
Well, that's good news, John. Well done.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay arrives and waves towards the camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comm)<br />
I'll, uh, have the reports ready for you.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands next to Sheppard, bouncing on his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into comm)<br />
Sam. Uh, what's new?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just making preparations for the change in command here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You don't have to tell me, I already know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(over comm, surprised)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I just want to say that I think the IOA could not have made a better choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(pleasantly surprised, over comm)<br />
Thanks, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into comm)<br />
No, no, no, no, no. You are too kind&#8230;what?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter just stares back with an expectant smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;"Thank you, Rodney." No, no, no&#8230;wait a minute, you mean the&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. She's our new boss.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay deflates as Carter continues to smile and shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
Huh.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Tyre, Ara, Ronon and Teyla now sit at a table drinking together.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I thought you guys were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Believe me, so did we.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How did you manage to survive the Wraith attack on Sateda?</blockquote>
<p>[Rakai arrives with tankards of drinks for them all.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
We weren't there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh, I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RAKAI<br />
When we first made the decision to fight back against the Wraith, we didn't just&#8230;wait for them to come to us, we started running ops against some of their known strongholds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
They were quick strikes. Get in, hit 'em hard, get out. Only on this particular occasion, we kind of messed up the getting out part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I saw the darts hit your position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
What you didn't see was that we'd found a network of caves in the hillside. When the Wraith attacked, the entrance collapsed, and we were sealed in. It took us three days to dig our way out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RAKAI<br />
And by then, the place was crawling with them. It was obvious they were gearing up for an attack. It took another two weeks before we could find our way through the 'gate and by then, it was too late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
When we got back to Sateda, there was nothing left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
I'm sorry. I should've never left you behind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Don't be an idiot, Ronon. When you took Second Squad back to the 'gate, you had no way of knowing those darts were going to come through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RAKAI<br />
And if we'd have gone back with you, then we would've died in the attack on Sateda along with everybody else. The only reason why you survived was because they made you a runner.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon pauses before taking a drink and sets down his tankard.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You heard about that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
A while back, we started hearing stories.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(smiling)<br />
They said you were seven feet tall and had the strength of five men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
People like to exaggerate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RAKAI<br />
They also said you killed a hundred Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That part sounds about right.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange laughs. Tyre nods in approval.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Well then, to the misery of our enemies and the reunion of friends come back from the dead.</blockquote>
<p>[He raises his glass in toast. They all follow suit and clink their tankards together, Teyla slightly more reluctantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S LAB, SGC</b>
</p><p>[Carter is dressed in her Class A uniform, closing a case containing her green BDUs, which still bear her SG-1 patch. In the lab are several packed boxes. Teal'c stands at the entrance.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
On the day I left Chulak, Master Bra'tac said to me: "Draw from your past, but do not let your past draw from you."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
That's good advice. Still, I know I'm going to miss this place, and all of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
I would have been offended had you felt otherwise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ten years is a long time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
It has been ten years well spent. We have defeated numerous enemies and overcome many threats.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(voice breaking)<br />
It was never dull.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
We have accomplished much here, but now it is Atlantis that is in need of you.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter takes a deep breath, trying to regain control of her emotions. Tears fall freely down her face.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah&#8230;Part of me is looking forward to going, but&#8230;you know, there's a part of me that thinks that maybe it's too soon, that I-that I'm leaving my work here unfinished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Your work will continue, only in a different place. You have been bestowed an incredible honor, Colonel Carter, and I believe you should embrace it. And know this, though we may not be leaving with you, SG-1 will never be far away.</blockquote>
<p>[Nodding, Carter laughs through her tears.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So I can expect you guys to come and visit sometime?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Undomesticated equines could not keep me away.</blockquote>
<p>[She chuckles and hugs him.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Nice call-back.</blockquote>
<p>[While in the embrace, Teal'c's own emotions threaten to overcome him. He pauses to gather himself before responding.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Indeed.</blockquote>
<p>[They slowly break the hug apart. Carter sighs and brushes the tears from her eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right. Time to go.</blockquote>
<p>[She nods determinedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEAL'C<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes her laptop case and leaves the lab with Teal'c.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The personnel of Atlantis are gathered to greet their new leader. McKay holds a large fruit basket.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a selection of fruits from the various worlds that we trade with. I thought it'd be thoughtful.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shifts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Try lame.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Really? And what would you suggest?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, maybe some flowers, you could brighten up her quarters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Flowers.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands off the fruit basket to a scientist standing nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here, take this&#8230;and go.</blockquote>
<p>[The bewildered man walks away as the Stargate activates. Carter steps through. An SF takes her case for her. Sheppard, Zelenka and McKay step forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel Carter, welcome to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(grinning)<br />
Thank you. It's nice to be here.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn and stand beside her as they face the rest of the personnel.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(louder, to everyone)<br />
Uh, I want you all to know how honored I am to accept this appointment. I've come here fully committed to this expedition, to Atlantis, and most importantly to each and every one of you. I look forward to working with all of you. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[The dismissed personnel start to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Carter)<br />
Nice speech.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thank you. I also do weddings and award shows. Book early to avoid disappointment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Should we go check out your new digs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sam.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka studies McKay shrewdly as Carter follows Sheppard out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Rakai tattoos Ronon's forearm with a large pattern of touching triangle shapes. Ronon bears the ritual stoically, until Rakai hits one spot.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<p>[He smacks Rakai across the face. Ara giggles, choking on her drink. Teyla looks bemused.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Stings, doesn't it?<br />
(looking around)<br />
What the hell have the three of you been doing all these years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
(arriving and taking a seat)<br />
Oh, eating, drinking&#8230;killing Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Rakai laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>RAKAI<br />
We've hit 'em more times than I can count. Racked up a pretty nice body count.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
Not to mention the twelve darts we've downed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RAKAI<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
We're armed, we're mobile, and occasionally we get some pretty good intel.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Ronon clank their tankards in a toasting maneuver.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, sounds like a pretty nice run.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
(soberly)<br />
But there have been a few sacrifices.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah? What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
There were five of us who came out of that cave alive. But we lost Marika on the first assault against the Wraith. And then Hemi last year.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon makes a sympathetic noise.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(upset)<br />
It hasn't been easy. We don't have much to work with, but we made do. Sometimes it's not enough.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla starts to make a diplomatic response, but Ronon speaks first.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well I might be able to help. We've got the manpower, the equipment. My friends and I, we can&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[His voice trails off as he notices Teyla glaring at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Uh&#8230;Anyway, um&#8230;to Marika and Hemi.</blockquote>
<p>[He lifts his tankard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
(studying Ronon)<br />
To Marika and Hemi.</blockquote>
<p>[They toast their fallen comrades.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARA AND RAKAI<br />
Marika and Hemi.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon is noticeably unhappy.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Carter has taken off her jacket and is moving boxes around. An expedition member brings in another box and sets it on a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay arrives as the man leaves. He holds a small, rather unimpressive bouquet of flowers.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hey Rodney, come on in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah. I brought you a little something to spruce up the place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, thank you. That's very sweet. There's a vase right there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[She turns back to unpack more. McKay watches her from behind then turns to the vase. He sees his fruit basket already on the table. Carter notices him looking at it.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh. Colonel Sheppard dropped that off. Apparently, it's a sampling of fruit from the homeworlds of our various trading partners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I thought it was a really thoughtful gesture.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(seething to himself)<br />
Oh, son of a&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He slams the flowers into the vase.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Anyway, look I just, uh, I just came by to, uh, welcome you to Atlantis, see how you're settling in and, uh, you know, if you needed anything, and, uh, did I mention I was seeing someone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
I'm sorry, what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm, uh, seeing someone. Yes, I-I only bring it up now because you're here now, and we'll be working together a lot more, and uh, you know, I just thought with our past&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
"Our past?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter blinks back her shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Rodney&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I just don't want things to be awkward between the two of us, you know? Uh&#8230;kind of like they are now.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter smiles awkwardly and sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(firmly)<br />
Rodney&#8230;I'm <i>sure</i> we'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, of course. I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just&#8230;with you&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon storms in.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I hear you're in charge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Uh, Ronon, this is Colonel Carter. Sam, this is Ronon. He's&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Satedan! And a member of your team. Of course. What can I do for you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Uh, I want to bring some friends to Atlantis, and apparently, I've got to clear it through you first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Unfortunately, some new security procedures prevent me from allowing any offworld visits to Atlantis for the time being.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
On whose authority?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It was a directive from the IOA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, they don't need to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ronon, she's a&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Carter holds up her hand to stop McKay's protest.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here. It is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And it will. They're my people. I'll vouch for them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'm sure you can, but for now, we're on a new planet with a new set of rules.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And a new person in charge.</blockquote>
<p>[He steps towards Carter in an intimidating manner.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Weir never would've doubted me.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter gives a mirthless chuckle.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay, first of all, Ronon, I'm not doubting you. These new regulations apply to everyone on this base. And secondly&#8230;I'm not Doctor Weir.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon steps back, still glowering at her as he leaves. Carter takes a deep breath after he's gone, regrouping.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Wow. Is he always like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh, no, no&#8230;No, actually, you've-you've caught him on a good day.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Tyre teaches defensive moves to the village children.]

<blockquote>TYRE<br />
You could have taken your time. We like it here! We're thinking of staying on a few more days.</blockquote>

Then where will you go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Wherever. That's one of the nice things about not being tied down. You go where you want, and you leave when you're not wanted.</blockquote>

Yeah, well, I was hoping my people would show a little bit more hospitality, but, uh&#8230;</blockquote>

Don't worry about it. I understand. Not everybody gets an invitation to Atlantis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm supposed to be their friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
No. You're their ally. Their guest. Me, Rakai, Ara, we're your friends. I don't doubt they're good people, They helped you out when you needed it, and from what I hear, they've done more to hurt the Wraith than anyone. You've got to respect that.

There's only one way to know for sure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, it's no more dangerous than the last time we went in.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, she's the one who gave us that advantage! The only reason we're here is because of what she did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Believe me, I know. And I don't like the idea of leaving someone behind any more than you do. But I am not about to send you or anyone else on a suicide mission.

They're more than my friends, Teyla. They're my family. We've always been there for each other. You wouldn't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I disagree! Leaving my fellow Athosians for a home here in Atlantis was a very difficult decision. I was their <i>leader</i>, for some, the only leader they'd ever known. And despite the fact that I was as close as a trip through the Stargate, there were moments when I felt I'd betrayed them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So what? You got over it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No! I sometimes still second guess my decision, but then I remember that I can do more here to help my people and the rest of the humans in this galaxy than I ever could on my homeworld.</blockquote>

(indulgently)<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And that you may think you're going back to find something you've lost, but there's nothing to go back to. Sateda is gone, and living on the run with your buddies isn't going to bring that back.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TYRE<br />
We know the Wraith are being attacked on several fronts. They don't have the resources anymore to properly guard all their facilities.</blockquote>

</p><p>[The Wraith enters the lab, where McKay has been working at the control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Doctor McKay, how is your work progressing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, it's been kind of slow. I mean, reestablishing the&#8230;base code's original setting isn't something I'll be able to accomplish overnight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Colonel Sheppard and Teyla will be most disappointed to hear this. I'll see to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quickly)<br />
I think I might be able to get it finished much&#8230;sooner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
I understand your desire to delay in the hope it will give your people time to mount a rescue. In fact, I just received word they're on their way. But, we are ready for them.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith leaves. Upset, McKay turns back to the Replicator, who is conscious inside the stasis field.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WRAITH LAB, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper buzzes the outside of the lab. Two darts take off and pursue it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Carter's group watches the pursuit from their own cloaked jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>JUMPER TWO PILOT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Okay, they're moving away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
Thank you, Jumper Two.<br />
(to pilot)<br />
Take us in, Lieutenant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LIEUTENANT<br />
Yes, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[He complies.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH LAB CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The outer door opens and Carter rolls a flash bang grenade in. Before a patrol of Wraith guards can act, it detonates. Ronon and Carter immediately enter and fire on the guards.]
</p>
<blockquote>LIEUTENANT<br />
Go, go!</blockquote>
<p>[The marines head out. Zelenka uses an Ancient scanner. It leads him to a wall where it beeps heavily.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
There's a power relay behind this wall here.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter shoots the wall.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH'S REPLICATOR LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay hears distant gunfire. The lights go out around him. He looks worriedly at the Replicator as the emergency backup starts up. The field around the Replicator stays intact.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[Weapons fire downs the guard stationed at Teyla and Sheppard's cell. Carter releases them. The marines protect their rear.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's about time! Any longer, and we would've had to save ourselves.</blockquote>
<p>[One of the marines provides Sheppard and Teyla new P-90s.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Did Ronon manage to make it back to Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
He did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We split up to cover more ground.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to marines)<br />
Secure the entrance. Go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH LAB CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon cautiously rushes through the corridors. He meets up with Tyre's team coming from the other direction. Ronon lowers his gun and claps Rakai on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(relieved)<br />
All right, come on. Let's get out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon turns back around from whence he came and starts to lead the out. The Wraith happens by as he reaches the doorway, and Ronon points his gun at the Wraith's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Where are you holding them?</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith glances over without turning his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Why don't you ask your friends?</blockquote>
<p>[Puzzled, Ronon glances back. Tyre, Ara, and Rakai are all clearly pointing their guns at him, not the Wraith.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH'S REPLICATOR LAB</b>
</p><p>[As McKay works, the gunfire draws closer. The Wraith guard tenses, then fires his weapon. He is downed in a hail of bullets. Sheppard, Teyla, Carter, Zelenka, rush inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(in high-pitched panic)<br />
All clear?! You could've shot me!</blockquote>
<p>[While they check the area, the stasis shield holding the Replicator finally shorts out. He lands on his feet. Teyla, Carter, and Sheppard point their guns at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no.</blockquote>
<p>[The trio fire their rifles at the Replicator as he steps forward. The bullets do not affect him, merely pass through as he heals. The Replicator steps doggedly forward, then turns, passing the team. Sheppard reloads his rifle as he steps forward. The team watch as the Replicator attacks the Wraith guards. Their weapons too are ineffective, and the Replicator quickly dispatches them with his bare hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go find Ronon.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WRAITH LAB CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Deal with him.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith hurries away as Ronon drops his weapon to his side in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're Wraith worshippers?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Ronon, you need to understand&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(emotional)<br />
After what they did to Sateda!?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Sateda is gone, and so are the lives we knew. We had a choice. To die with the past, or live for the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(disgusted)<br />
What did they do to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(with zeal)<br />
They rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life. The same gift can be yours if you're willing to accept it. We resisted at first; we were stubborn. But the Wraith were determined.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[A mixture of images of Tyre, Ara, and Rakai, being fed upon by the Wraith and then having their life energy restored to them&#8212;making them appear to de-age dramatically from very old to their current age.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
They showed us our futures. They allowed us to experience our life's end, pushing us to the brink so that we could see the truth.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
&#8230;and brought us back.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks at the others. Tyre and Rakai both look upset, but determined.]
</p><p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p>[More images of this torture.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
They showed us again, and again, and again&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Until they broke you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
Until we finally accepted the truth&#8230;and their gift.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Ronon, join us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sneering)<br />
You're insane!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
(fighting tears)<br />
Don't let your pride get in the way&#8230;like Marika and Hemi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They didn't die on any run, did they?! They were murdered because they wouldn't turn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
They were killed by their own stubbornness. Don't make the same mistake. Join us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(heartbroken)<br />
No. Never. Run. You run. Run, and get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
There won't be a next time.</blockquote>
<p>[He holsters his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
We will finish this like true Satedans.</blockquote>
<p>[Ara and Rakai holster their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You are not Satedans!</blockquote>
<p>[He takes off his gun belt. They all do the same and toss them aside. The group then engage in hand-to-hand combat, three on one. There is a flurry of kicks and blows. Ronon is able to knock down Ara and Rakai, but Tyre gets some blows in, knocking Ronon off balance.]
</p><p>[The pair circle, trading more calculated blows before fighting in earnest. Finally they pin each other's arms. Tyre still kicks, but Ronon just takes the hits and doesn't let go. Behind Ronon, Rakai pulls out a knife. Tyre sees him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Rakai, no!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(snarling to Tyre)<br />
So much for honor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARA<br />
No weapons!</blockquote>
<p>[She rushes forward to grab Rakai. He spins, surprised, still holding the knife, and accidentally slashes her across the throat, hitting her jugular. She grabs at her neck and stumbles back as the others watch in horror. Rakai screams in rage and rushes Ronon. Ronon is able to knock Tyre aside. He and Rakai fight, but Ronon easily gets the upper-hand. He pins Rakai's knife arm, breaking it and wresting the knife out of his grasp. Ronon stabs Rakai in the chest, then cradles Rakai in his arms, clutching him until he dies. Tyre stands to see both Ara and Rakai dead. Ronon is back-to him, but realizes he's there, and that he's not attacking.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(breathing heavily)<br />
Hasn't there been enough killing? Huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Tyre walks away.]
</p><p>[Ronon looks down to see Rakai's and his own blood covering him.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH LAB CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and the others run down another corridor, having to step over dead Wraith and the deactivated Replicator. McKay first spots a shadow and they all aim their weapons, but it is Ronon. They lower their guns.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ronon, where are your friends?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon glances from Teyla and Carter over to Sheppard and McKay. He doesn't break stride.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They're right here. Let's go home.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone exchanges looks. Sheppard looks at Rodney, who nods subtly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;RONON'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Ronon sits on his bed, thinking. The door is already open, and he hears someone approaching.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is that my painting?</blockquote>
<p>[It is Teyla, and she carries the painting that had been hanging on Ronon's wall of three warriors standing on an outcropping with a deep red sky backdrop.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
Yes. Rodney felt that you should have it back.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes the painting from her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I didn't give it to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, he helped himself, assuming that you were leaving it behind.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon gives Teyla an unamused look. He turns away and sets the painting down. Teyla schools her expression into something bland, but doesn't succeed. Ronon looks at her expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Um&#8230;all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(with emphasis)<br />
It's nice to have you back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thanks. It's good to be back.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles and nods before leaving. Ronon sits on the bed and stares at the painting.]
