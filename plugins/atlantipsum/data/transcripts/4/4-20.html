<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, M4S-587, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard meets up with Lorne's team at the area.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
So how'd it go, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(frustrated)<br />
The Genii contact didn't show up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Can't say I'm surprised.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you saying, Major? The Genii can't be trusted?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Well they did try to kill you and Doctor McKay, along with that little girl.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
True, true. And normally, that's the kind of thing I take personally. But, Ladon claims he didn't order the hit. He's trying to get on our good side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Do you really think they know anything about where Michael took Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, they got solid intel, and we're following up any lead, no matter how thin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Okay, so, what do you want to do?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to dial the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I'm going go ahead. You stay behind for a few hours. Tell me if he shows up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Will do.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pauses before walking to the wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're going to find her, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps through the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard arrives. The wormhole shuts down behind him. There is a red glow from the light coming through the windows. The control room is quiet and deserted.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Somebody turn up the heat?<br />
(calling out)<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[There is no one else anywhere around.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nervously)<br />
If this is a surprise party, it's not my birthday.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks up to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Sheppard, anyone read?&#8230;I repeat, this is Sheppard. Anyone on this channel?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard goes to the balcony doors. He has to manually pry them open.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard steps out onto the balcony. The ocean has dried up, making the entire area a barren desert. The city itself is half buried under sands, showing this was not a recent development. The sunlight that beats down on Sheppard has a reddish glow. Sheppard looks around intently, breathing hard.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard reenters the control room and tries to activate some of the stations. Nothing starts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(muttering to himself)<br />
All right. This is either the most elaborate practical joke of all time, or I'm in serious trouble here.</blockquote>
<p>[The radio crackles. A garbled voice can be heard through the static.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Sheppard. Anyone on this frequency?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sheppard, is that really you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, relieved)<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
I can't believe it. It actually worked!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
What are you talking about? What the hell's going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, I-I imagine you're a little confused right now. God, for you, like what, five minutes has passed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Look, I need you to describe exactly what you're seeing. Where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm in the control room. It's deserted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Is there any power?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, slightly panicky)<br />
No, everything's dead. And, oh yeah, did I tell you the ocean's gone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sorry, what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
The big blue thing out the window, it-it's gone! It-it's a desert. And it's about a hundred and twenty degrees in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Whoa. Jeez. The planet must have undergone some serious climate changes!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, threatening)<br />
If you don't start giving me some answers pretty soon here&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Okay, look, I understand this is hard for you. Just&#8230;do me a favor and go to the hologram room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Just do it. Please.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard runs down the steps.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard runs through the empty corridors to the hologram room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS HOLOGRAM ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The room is dark and empty when Sheppard arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right, I'm here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, activate the hologram projector.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
There's no power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Heh, it's connected to an independent power source. Don't worry, it will work.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard passes his hand over the controls. The room lights up and McKay appears behind him. McKay has aged&#8212;his hair is grey, his face wrinkled. He wears a cardigan and other loose casual clothes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey there.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard spins around and looks at McKay in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stunned)<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
God, it's good to see you again.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard backs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're a hologram!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with mock surprise)<br />
No&#8230;! Of course. I-I'm tapped into the city's, um, internal sensors, so I've got eyes and ears, so to speak. You look good!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You look&#8230;uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard passes his hand through McKay's chest. The hologram image falters as he pierces it. McKay looks down with mild interest, but no pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
&#8230;different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. That's because you remember me the, uh, the way I was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(becoming irritated)<br />
What, you mean earlier today?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(musing)<br />
Ah, it's funny, you know? I've spent the last twenty-five years of my life trying to figure out how to make this work, and I never once thought what I was going to say to you when you got here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can start by telling me what the hell's going on here!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts to pace.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, right. Okay, um&#8230;remember that mission report? SG-1 stepped through the 'gate. Their wormhole accidentally intersected with a solar flare, and they were sent back to 1969?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh&#8230;well, vaguely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, something similar has just happened to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was sent back in time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, no. In fact, you were sent forward, into the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far into the future?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Interesting question. And one that was not easy to figure out. I had to determine the exact characteristics of the solar flare in question&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(hesitantly)<br />
48,000 years, give or&#8230;take?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rocks back in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is a practical joke.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I'm afraid not. Freak accident. Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(upset)<br />
You're telling me I just travelled 48,000 years into the future in ten seconds?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(intrigued)<br />
I know. It is kind of cool when you think about it, isn't it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(more upset)<br />
Surfing a thirty foot wave in Waimea is cool. Dating a supermodel is cool. This is not cool!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, calm down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stunned by a new thought)<br />
If I'm in the future, that means you're, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dead. Dead and buried and turned to dust a long, long time ago. Along with everyone you ever knew. There's no way of knowing what the state of human civilization is, whether it even&#8230;still exists. I mean, we've obviously abandoned this city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Yeah, obviously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's not enough power for you to 'gate back to Earth. And without a MALP, going anywhere else would be far too risky. It is entirely possible that you are the last human being alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(disturbed)<br />
You're not doing a very good job of cheering me up here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, consider yourself lucky, young man. While I was figuring out this plan, I had no way of knowing whether the city would even survive this long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I took advantage of some progress in hologram technology to create this simulation. I'm able to move anywhere inside the city. I'm fully interactive, and I'm designed to mimic the exact response and appearance of the great Doctor Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Couldn't use anyone else, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Funny. Um&#8230;I'm linked to the city's main systems, but I have an independent core drive which is sealed in the foundation of one of the outer buildings along with a Mark XII naquadah generator and a couple of other, uh, well, key components. It's kind of like a, um, well, what would you say&#8230;? Like a time capsule, so to speak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's really nice to have company, but, if what you're saying is true, what good does it do me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, trust me, I wouldn't go to all this trouble just so we could have a chat. No&#8230;no, I'm here to bring you back. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leads Sheppard out of the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Lights come on in each section as Sheppard and the holographic McKay pass, then turn off as the hologram moves out of range.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Stasis chamber.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
To buy some time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, that really explains everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Theoretically, we can send you back exactly the way you got here, using the 'gate, the right address, and a solar flare. Only problem is, we're waiting for something very specific, a prominence with exactly the right shape, size, characteristics, and relative position in space so that it will interact with the wormhole in exactly the right manner, and send you back exactly the right amount of time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And that doesn't happen every day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How long are we talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, seven, eight hundred years. A thousand tops.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stops short.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That-that's your plan?! I-I'm 48,000 years into the future, and you want to put me on ice for another thousand?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Tops. Well, we need to be precise. If I don't get you back within two months of the moment you left, then&#8230;it'll be too late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Too late? Wha-what the hell is that supposed to mean?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Things didn't exactly go well for us after your disappearance. Once I figured out what happened to you, I realized there was nothing we could do. The Air Force pronounced you KIA&#8212;gave you a-a very nice military funeral back on Earth. Obviously, the casket was empty, but, uh, you know&#8230;it's the thought that counts. Heh. From there, well&#8230; From there, things went from bad to worse.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE, M2S-445, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, McKay and Lorne's team sweep through the building, weapons raised.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
We kept searching for Teyla, but we just didn't have the resources to cover enough ground. It took us two months before we finally found her, in one of Michael's hideouts. But by then it was too late.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon crouches down by Teyla, checking her pulse. Rodney has tears in his eyes as he realizes she is not alive.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sadly)<br />
She'd had the baby. I guess&#8230;after that, he didn't have any use for her anymore&#8230;So he killed her.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard both look devastated.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay head down another corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not your fault!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I should've been there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
And you will be. And&#8230;knowing the address where we eventually found Teyla, you will be able to get there much quicker. You know, save Teyla, save the baby, change the fate of the galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(animated)<br />
Well, it was the turning point. It was the key to everything. Once Michael had that baby, he was able to complete his research and perfect the hybrids.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
After that, well, he really kicked things into gear.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL</b>
</p><p>[Atlantis medical personnel treat patients in the hospital. Keller passes a blanket over a patient who's died, looking distraught.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
He stepped up his campaign of exposing human populations to the Hoffan drug. Jennifer did her best to find a way to combat the effects and was trying to lower the mortality rate, but ultimately, it was a losing battle.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Wraith hive ships fire on each other in a pitched battle.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
With their food supplies tainted, the infighting between the Wraith factions got worse. Michael waited until they were at each other's throats&#8230;and then he made his move.</blockquote>
<p>[Another hive ship drops out of hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Status?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HYBRID<br />
Both hives are heavily damaged. They've lost hyperdrive and are venting atmosphere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Well, then, let's finish it.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Michael's hive ship fires on both other ships, destroying them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TENT</b>
</p><p>[Two hybrid soldiers drag in a Wraith queen. She struggles but is too weak to resist. They force her to kneel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
He took advantage of their weakened state and their internal divisions, and in less than a year, he had the Wraith on their knees. Literally.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael stands in the tent, fingering the sharpness of a knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
You know, the irony is, I never asked for any of this. I was taken prisoner by the humans. Tortured. Experimented on. And when I finally escaped and returned to my Wraith brothers, instead of being welcomed back, I was met with scorn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
You will pay for this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(sneering)<br />
You still have your pride. Good for you.</blockquote>
<p>[He slashes with the knife, and the queen's headless body falls.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ENCAMPMENT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Michael steps out of the tent to stand before his hybrid army. He raises the decapitated head of the Wraith queen, and his troops cheer.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STAIRWELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
With the Wraith in disarray, Michael returned to the human populations he'd infected with the Hoffan drug. He selected the strongest and the healthiest of the survivors and converted them to hybrids. The rest he exterminated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think by saving Teyla, we can change all this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know it. All I have to do is get you safely to a stasis chamber. I will reprogram the sensors&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The arrive in a corridor. It is filled with sand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(deflating)<br />
Oh. That could be a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no. That's not a problem. We'll just find another way around.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's image flickers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There is no other way around.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay walk closer to the sand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The sand has penetrated the lower levels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
48,000 years into the future, you've still got a knack for stating the obvious. All right, what do we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you mean, you don't know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Well, I wasn't programmed for this variable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You said you had twenty-five years to work on this plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, McKay did! And he brilliantly anticipated a lot of potential problems. It's just that&#8230;well&#8230;this wasn't one of them.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts heading back the way they came.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(thinking quickly)<br />
All right. Go up two levels, turn right, there's an outer door. It's only a quarter mile across the plaza.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not only is it extremely hot out there, but for the last half an hour, the barometric pressure has been dropping, and the wind speeds have increased significantly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Storm's coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A sandstorm. You ever been in one of those?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
As a matter of fact, I have!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Oh, then-then you know what that means.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not like we have a lot of options, here.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts jogging to the stairs. The hologram reluctantly follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard arrives at the closed outer door. He can hear the wind whipping furiously outside. McKay arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sounds pretty nasty out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The winds are gusting over fifty miles an hour and increasing. The visibility's basically zero. You can't go out there. You're just gonna have to wait it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For how long?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I don't know. Maybe a couple of hours?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sighs and collapses against the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(concerned)<br />
Are you hungry? Do you have any food?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
Nah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, well, I suppose it doesn't really matter anyways. We'll just wait for the storm to blow over and have you out of here in no time at all. Well, you'll actually be here for 700 years, but, uh&#8230;you know what I mean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about everyone else? I mean, you told me about Teyla, but what about the rest of them? There's no way we would've rolled over and let Michael take over the whole galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quietly)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The IOA and the military were reluctant to commit a lot of resources to protecting the human populations of another galaxy. But Sam..? Heh. Sam wouldn't take no for an answer.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>PHOENIX</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Carter and McKay tour the corridors, watching personnel assemble and set up new systems.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Finally, they decided to give her a new ship, the <i>Phoenix</i>. It was barely off the assembly line. Half the Asgard systems weren't finished, the other half&#8230;weren't working.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter smiles. McKay looks more pessimistic.]

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's what I'm counting on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And why is that? You survived; you got the girl; it doesn't sound so bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No&#8230;no at first, it was great.</blockquote>
<p>[He smiles as he reminisces.]
</p><p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SUBURBAN STREET, EARTH, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller and McKay walk down a sidewalk, arm in arm. From the foliage, it is autumn.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I got a high-paying job with an aerospace engineering firm. Jennifer started her own practice. Things were just starting to come together.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller pauses, wracked by several hoarse coughs. After she's done and pulls her hand away, she notices she's coughed up blood. She exchanges concerned looks with McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
We should've known we wouldn't get off so easy.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[A doctor speaks with McKay while looking at chest X-rays of Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
I'm sorry to say, but all her internal organs are failing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Of course, no regular doctor could diagnose what was wrong with her. We wound up back at Stargate Command less than a year after we'd left. Complications due to repeated exposure to the Hoffan drug. No cure.</blockquote>
<p>[While the hologram McKay explains, the doctor in the flashback continues to explain his diagnosis to McKay, who becomes more devastated with each word. He looks over to Keller's bed, where she lies unconscious, tended by nurses.]
</p>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
&#8230;I'm so sorry.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay stands alone in a corridor, lost in his thoughts.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I thought I was going to lose my mind. I didn't know what to do. After everything we'd been through, to have this happen was too much. And that's when I had my idea.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay, looking inspired, heads off quickly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller is awake and sees McKay enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(weakly)<br />
Where have you been?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've been working!</blockquote>
<p>[He grins and waves the papers in his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Working? On what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The solution. To everything. Well, you. This. All of this! I mean, Atlantis, Pegasus, Michael&#8230;everything!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm going to change the timeline. I'm going to make it so none of this ever happened. I mean, you won't get sick, Teyla won't die, Michael won't complete his research, none of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sighing)<br />
Oh, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I've already worked out the basic plan. I mean, the details will be a bit more complicated. I'll probably have to create a whole new form of math just to do the calculations, but I-I know I can do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What's done is done. You can't change the past.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you can. I can! And I'm going to&#8230;even if it takes the rest of my life.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You think that's what I want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(confused)<br />
Well, why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(crying)<br />
The year I spent in Atlantis, I&#8230;I saw more things than people even dream about in their lifetime&#8230;I don't have any regrets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulantly)<br />
Well, I do! I've got a whole boatload of them, and I want to do something about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No. Just promise me that you're not going to waste the rest of your life chasing after something that's already gone.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay fights back tears.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
But I couldn't let it go. She died three days later.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S APARTMENT, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on calculations in a small, cluttered apartment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I quit the research firm. Took a job teaching physics at a local community college. Not much money, but it gave me the free time I needed.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S APARTMENT, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Time has passed, and while McKay's outfit has changed, he still works on calculations. This time his sister Jeanie is with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I'll admit it wasn't much of a life. Jeanie came by every once in a while to check up on me. When she realized she wasn't going to be able to convince me to stop, she decided to pitch in and help me with the calculations.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie erases part of a calculation on his whiteboard and replaces it with her own.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's obviously nothing. I did that yesterday. Look&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh, you did not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, look, this is what I'm thinking about doing&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They continue to bicker.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Eventually, even she got fed up. I never wavered.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S APARTMENT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Years went by, twenty-five years to be exact. And suddenly I had it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay works on an advanced computer monitor, changing calculations using a glove on his hand. McKay has aged, looking the same as he does in the hologram image appearing to Sheppard. He looks at the finished work with satisfaction.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[An airman escorts McKay through the briefing room to the general's office.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
There was only one problem. I needed to get back to Atlantis. I didn't have a lot of friends at Stargate Command, but I only needed one.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LORNE'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Major General E. Lorne is the commander of the SGC. He stands to greet McKay. Among his office decorations are paintings he has done, including one of Atlantis he had been working on in "Sunday". Lorne moves slowly. His hair is greying and his face has some wrinkles.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Doctor McKay. Good to see you.</blockquote>
<p>[They shake hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
General Lorne.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Come on in, have a seat.</blockquote>
<p>[They sit.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I, uh, I read your proposal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You didn't tell anyone else, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I'm not quite as stupid as you might think, Doc. But I'm sorry, there-there's just no way I'd ever be able to get this authorized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well then, don't. You don't have to tell them what it is. I mean, tell them it's a research project. Tell them whatever the hell you want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Rodney&#8230;you're talking about altering the timeline here. Changing history. Changing everything! Do you really think that either of us has the right to make that call?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let's cut to the chase. You saw what happened in Pegasus. You know what's happening here. You really think this is the way it's supposed to be?</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne sighs and looks torn.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe he felt sorry for me, maybe he figured it wasn't going to work anyway, but&#8230;he let me through. The rest, you know.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks uncomfortable.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Well, I guess I've had a tough day, but you've had a tough&#8230;twenty-five years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, we're ready.</blockquote>
<p>[The stasis chamber opens. Sheppard steps inside it, looking uncertain.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now if this works, I'll be waiting right here when you come out. We don't have much time to get you through the 'gate, but I think we can manage it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And if it doesn't work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you won't feel a thing. Basically, you just won't wake up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[They both shift awkwardly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In the past twenty-five years, you happen to notice who won the Superbowl?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, uh, afraid not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ah. Stanley Cup? No. World Series?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
I was never really much of a sports fan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. Had to ask.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay waves his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good luck, John.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is frozen in stasis. The McKay hologram dematerializes.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate chevrons start locking.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Unscheduled off-world activation!</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay head to Chuck's station.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What have you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Receiving IDC.<br />
(surprised)<br />
It's Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Lower the shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Carter and McKay hurry down the steps.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Security!</blockquote>
<p>[SFs arrive, aiming their guns warily at the wormhole. Sheppard leaps through, raising his hands immediately at the guards' weapons as the wormhole shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa! Whoa.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
John&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares around in awe and relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It worked. It worked. Rodney, you're a genius.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
John, what happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How much time has gone by?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You've been missing for twelve days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(muttering to himself)<br />
Twelve days, twelve days&#8230;okay. She wouldn't have had her baby yet.<br />
(to Carter)<br />
Look, I know this sounds kinda weird, but we're on the clock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
John, what are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know where Teyla is.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and McKay exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Atlantis sits in the ocean in the present day.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard paces impatiently in the room. Carter is with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(frustrated)<br />
We don't have time for this!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
John, there are procedures we have to follow. You know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I am not a clone. Is that what you're worried about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No, your medical came back clean. Telomeres and all. But there are other things we need to discuss. I mean, you have to admit, this is a pretty wild story, even for this place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But that's my whole point. How could I make this up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sam, believe it or not, I found it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between McKay's and Carter and Sheppard's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's in the sensor log. It's a solar flare capable of interfering with the wormhole from M4S-587 at exactly the moment that Lorne says he dialed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, why didn't the 'gate's fail-safe prevent the wormhole from locking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
Uh&#8230;Well, we've had a number of glitches since we, uh, last updated the operating system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(piqued)<br />
Oh, that's what you call a glitch, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks guilty as he glances at Chuck.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well&#8230;you should know that, uh, I'll be giving Zelenka a stern talking to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Carter)<br />
Can we go now?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods, and they leave the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team, Lorne's team, and another marine team check their weapons as the Stargate is dialed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Look, um, I know you've already been debriefed about the, uh, future events, all the things we're hoping to avoid, but there's just one more thing I need to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do I still have hair?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon rolls his eyes. Sheppard pauses, considering his answer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(lying)<br />
No.<br />
(to everyone)<br />
Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[They head out, McKay pausing for a moment while he digests Sheppard's answer.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE, M2S-445, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE</b>
</p><p>[The teams sweep through the warehouse. They split up. Ronon and Sheppard go one way with some of the team. McKay and Lorne go another.]
</p><p>[Lorne and McKay check out a room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney, you got anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Hold on. Yeah&#8230;.yeah, I got some kind of a-a data terminal. Let me see if I can power it up and hack in.</blockquote>
<p>[He approaches the Wraith-style device.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE NURSERY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon approach the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is it. This is where they found her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How do you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because he described it to me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon groans, but they sweep into the room. It is empty. Sheppard checks out one side, while Ronon passes a Wraith-style incubator and other equipment to look at some large, sharp blades on a table. He holds up a very wide and jagged one.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey. Look at this.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH DATA TERMINAL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on the data terminal.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
McKay, we got something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between the McKay's and Sheppard's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Some twisted version of a maternity ward. I think we're too early though, but he's going to bring her here to have the baby.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hold on. I'm in.</blockquote>
<p>[A display comes up on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa! Jackpot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What have you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I got everything. I've got gate addresses. I've got subspace communication codes. I've even got his research into the hybrids. He's history!</blockquote>
<p>[He exchanges triumphant smiles with Lorne. Behind him, the screen shorts out. A new display comes up, showing symbols appearing at timed intervals, along with a beeping.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. No, no, no, no. What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<p>[He stands, looking very worried.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(nervously)<br />
Doc?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a countdown.</blockquote>
<p>[From both locations, a distant rumbling can be heard. The building shakes.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Colonel, it's a booby trap. We've got to get out of here now!</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne and McKay race for the door, but a girder falls, blocking their path. The floor shakes beneath them, keeping them unbalanced.]
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon dodge falling debris as they try to get to the exit. Every way is quickly becoming blocked.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE, M2S-445, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The building collapses.]
</p><p><b>TO BE CONTINUED</b>
</p><p><b>FADE OUT</b>
