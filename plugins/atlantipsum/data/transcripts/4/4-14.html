<p>Always keen on helping their allies, Sheppard and McKay accept a proposal made by Harmony’s sisters to accompany her on a trek into the forest to seek guidance to become queen in her late mother’s stead. Will Harmony become the planet’s new queen, or will an enemy assassinate her &#8212; and her escorts?<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_4.14_%22Harmony%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 4.14 &quot;Harmony&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

</p>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
And to another fine year of trading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hear, hear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Truly, the medical supplies you have given to us over the past several years have made an immeasurable difference to our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
Not to mention your warning last harvest that the Wraith were nearby. You saved many lives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(modestly)<br />
Well, uh, you know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My favorite missions are when we come here to do our trading. And I've said that&#8212;I can prove it. I'm not just&#8230;saying that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't need to prove it. Uh, you know, actually, we've got to get going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
So soon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, so soon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
We were hoping that&#8230;you could stay&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's eyes widen.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I-I guess we could stay a little longer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
I hate to&#8230;no, never mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Well, I wouldn't dream of imposing. You've been so generous to our people already.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's the problem?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Our sister. She's in great need of your help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I didn't even know you gals had a sister.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
We do, indeed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And I imagine she's as, uh, beautiful as you two?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard look intrigued.]
</p>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Even more so&#8230;and she is in great need of guidance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Guidance. That I can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
(sighing in relief)<br />
You are most generous. Excuse us, for one moment. I'll get her.</blockquote>
<p>[Flora and Mardola leave the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dibs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm calling dibs on the third sister.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can't call dibs!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, we both know that Flora and Mardola have been suckered in by the whole "cliche-heroic" thing you've got going, but, uh, maybe this other sister, maybe her taste in will run more to the, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Geeky?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was going to say "cerebral", but who knows? Maybe we'll hit it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't need your love life screwing up our trade relations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smug)<br />
I'll try not to break her heart, but, uh, no promises.</blockquote>
<p>[Footsteps approach. Flora arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
These are the men I was telling you about. Gentlemen, this is our sister, Harmony.</blockquote>
<p>[Mardola and Harmony enter the room. Harmony is very beautiful&amp;emdash;and around thirteen years old.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Super.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CASTLE DINING ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
As you know, our mother and queen passed at the beginning of this lunar cycle. A secret, sacred ceremony was held to determine which of her three daughters would succeed her. It was determined that Harmony shall be the new queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really? Wow. Well, congrats.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Before she is crowned, all future queens must perform a time-honored rite of passage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
(petulantly)<br />
A rite of passage normally performed alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
(firmly)<br />
It is not written one way or another. And Harmony is so young, it concerns me greatly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I can do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
You are very brave, but the trail is difficult. It would bring me great comfort to know that you had someone looking out for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What kind of rite of passage are we talking about, here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Deep in the forest lies the ruins of the Great Temple of Laros. Every queen must take a pilgrimage before the end of the first lunar cycle of their selection. Once there, she must meditate on the journey that lies ahead of her, and pray to be endowed with the knowledge and power to govern her people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How deep in the forest?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
No more than a day's trek.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I see. Yes. No, we, uh, we are very honored, but um, why don't you just have a couple of your own guards escort her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
Although it is not written so, our people will expect their new queen to have completed the journey on her own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So&#8230;you don't want her to be alone, but you don't want anyone to know that she's getting help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
Precisely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. We'd love to lend a hand, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
(flirtatiously)<br />
John, our peoples have enjoyed such a fruitful alliance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
One that has greatly benefitted <i>both</i> parties.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
I'd hate to think that one of us would put that in jeopardy over a simple day's walk in the forest.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard doesn't know how to respond. She smiles at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
When do we leave?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs with a knowing smirk. Harmony smiles.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay, and Harmony walk through a field.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(excitedly)<br />
I must confess, I'm quite looking forward to this. I rarely get to leave the confines of the castle, although I've had much training in forest survival.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, you have, have you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(confidently)<br />
Oh, yes. I have completed three sessions with Nolar Lumsbred. He is one of the greatest hunters amongst my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Three whole sessions, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
With <i>the</i> Nolar Lumsbred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
They were all I needed. I am a quick learner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll bet you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Tell me, which one of you is the superior officer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You mean who outranks here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm a civilian. I don't have a rank. But, basically, we're equals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Technically, I'm in charge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I thought so. You have all the makings of an excellent leader, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, thank you.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard takes lead as they enter the forest. McKay is finishing a power bar.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You going to eat your PowerBar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, Rodney. I told you, you shouldn't have eaten yours so early in the day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm starving! Usually Flora feeds us some sort of food when we visit. Come on! You hardly ever eat yours!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, will you give it to me later when you decide not to eat it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You allow him to question you so incessantly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess I'm just used to it by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Would it not be easier to beat him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We don't beat people where we come from.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we find it's not very effective in the long run&#8230;unfortunately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Really? You are a truly gentle leader, John. I admire that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you, Harmony.</blockquote>
<p>[They have reached a ravine. There is pillars at either side, but no way across the ravine. Sheppard checks a piece of parchment.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Isn't there supposed to be a rope bridge here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe you're reading the map wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, I think it's pretty straightforward. How old is this map?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It has been passed down from too many generations to know for sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, I guess that bridge doesn't exist.</blockquote>
<p>[He packs the map parchment into his vest and unclips his pack, leaving it on the trail.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You two stay put, I'm going to try to find a safe way across the river.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, no, wait, wha&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't worry. I'll be right back.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. McKay and Harmony exchange glances, then McKay walks away to find someplace to sit. Harmony starts rummaging through Sheppard's pack. With a sigh, McKay sits on a mossy tree trunk. Harmony soon joins him; she munches on a PowerBar.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where'd you find that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
John's bag.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It-it's not yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I'm hungry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you can't just take it like that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
When I'm hungry, I eat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's going to happen when Sheppard finds out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Well, he's not going to now, is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, yes he is, 'cause I'm going to tell him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(in dangerous tone)<br />
I wouldn't do that if I were you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, or what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I'm the queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not yet, you're not, little sister.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Trust me, you don't want to be on my bad side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right? And what are you going to do? You gonna have me beaten?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks nonplussed at her cold glare. Rallying, he stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, princess, just&#8230;hand it over!</blockquote>
<p>[She gobbles the rest of the bar and hands him the wrapper.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh&#8230;see, now you're in trouble. You just wait 'till Sheppard gets back here, 'cause he's gonna&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard returns from behind McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I think I found a place for us to, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He spots McKay holding the empty wrapper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is that my PowerBar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
She stole it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(affronted)<br />
I did not!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, what?! You so did! Tell him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I would never do such a thing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The second you were gone, she went into your bag!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You are a liar! You are a lying liar!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, please, who are you going to believe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if she stole it, Rodney&#8230;how come you've got the wrapper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
Well, bu&#8212;I&#8230;I was trying to take it back from her, and then she wolfs it down and hands me the wrapper!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(fiercely to Harmony)<br />
Okay, you'd better come clean, brat!</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony bursts into sobs and holds out her arms to Sheppard, who grudgingly steps forward to receive her embrace.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's okay, sweetie. Sometimes, he makes me cry, too.</blockquote>
<p>[Her face hidden from Sheppard in this position, Harmony turns, dry-eyed, to McKay and makes a throat-slitting gesture. McKay blinks. Harmony continues her sobbing act.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we need to get going here. All right? I found a path.</blockquote>
<p>[He extricates himself from Harmony and leads the way.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(whining)<br />
Can I navigate from the map?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure, as soon as we get back on the path.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony schools her expression back to calmness, and shoots McKay a bright, smug smile before passing him. McKay watches, flabbergasted, before setting his jaw and following.]
</p><p>[Later, Harmony leads the way, studying the map. They reach a fork in the trail.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(uncertain)<br />
Now&#8230;we go&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(confidently)<br />
Correct.</blockquote>
<p>[As they move, amongst the birds calling is the sound of a deep growl. McKay and Sheppard instantly raise their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(blithely)<br />
That's probably the beast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sorry, the what now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
The beast&#8212;the protector of the Ruins of Laros. Did Flora not tell you of it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(fuming)<br />
I guess she forgot to mention it.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony takes out a multi-use tool and pulls out a blade.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Don't worry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
When you say "beast", I'm assuming that's a figure of speech, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Oh, no. It's a beast, all right. Though no one is quite certain what it looks like. Those who have cast their eyes upon it have quickly perished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
But your little knife will protect us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I'm the queen. It will not harm me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we may not get the chance to tell the beast that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It will know.</blockquote>
<p>[She closes her knife blade and starts down the trail. McKay hurries to catch up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Listen, why don't we just tell your sisters we made it as far as the ruins? We don't actually have to make it there. I mean, they'd never have to know the difference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I would know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but you're going to be queen, so who cares? Right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(upset)<br />
I care! My people care!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Listen&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Perhaps it would be best if you stopped speaking. Your voice hurts my ears!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, that beast could hurt my whole body, okay? So I'm sorry, but this is not what we signed up for! Sheppard, back me up here.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to Sheppard for support, only to realize Sheppard is not with them. He looks around in alarm. Harmony takes out her knife again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sheppard? John!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
According to legend, the beast attacks silently.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I thought you said the beast would know you were the queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Well, it didn't attack <i>me</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
John? John, are you there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It is strange, though&#8230;the beast is supposed to only attack enemies of the throne. If it was going to kill anyone, it should have killed you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not an enemy of the throne! I'm not! I'm here to protect you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
Don't move!</blockquote>
<p>[Guns can be heard cocking behind them as men in Genii uniforms appear out of the foliage. McKay raises his hands in surrender.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
So far, I'm not impressed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
Drop your weapon.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay unhooks the P-90 from his vest and lays it on the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
(into radio)<br />
We have her. Map Grid Eleven in the small clearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TERAN THE GENII FIELD CAPTAIN<br />
(over radio)<br />
We're on our way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Hand her over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're Genii!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
Step aside, and hand her over.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay puts himself between Harmony and the soldiers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(holding his hands up defensively)<br />
This is obviously some sort of huge misunderstanding, all right? I am-I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. I'm-I'm a close, personal friend of, uh, Ladon Radim. You know, your leader?</blockquote>
<p>[They don't lower their weapons. McKay continues to stand between them and Harmony, who hides behind McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I'm-I'm your greatest ally! I&#8212;you don't know who I am? Look, I'm the genius scientist! The friend of John Sheppard? I gave you the bomb? No? Nothing? What do they teach you in Genii school?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
Hand her over, right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, let's just talk about this.</blockquote>
<p>[The soldier takes a couple steps forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
I'm growing impatient. Our quarrel is not with you. Once you hand her over, you're free to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(perking)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[He appears to consider this option. Harmony looks scandalized.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You wouldn't! You took a sacred oath to protect me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nah, I don't remember doing that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER 1<br />
I'm going to count to three. One&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Three shots fire in rapid succession, felling the soldier who spoke and the two other Genii soldiers. Sheppard steps out from the foliage, his P-90 still trained on them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where have you been?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, my Spidey senses felt an ambush comin' on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, and you couldn't mention it?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, not without tipping them off, no!</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony has stepped around McKay and now stares at the Genii soldier's corpse in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what took you so long? We were just about to get&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I had to take up a position, so I could shoot all three at once.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard notices Harmony's expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(shakily, but regaining her haughtiness)<br />
No&#8230;no, I most certainly am not. This one was going to hand me over to those men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I wasn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I saw it in your eyes. You were considering it! To save your own worthless, cowardly hide.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was keeping them talking. You know? I was buying us time? A little thing called "strategy"? Obviously, you're too young to know anything about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Oh, I understand strategy. In fact, I'm forming one right now! The second we return to the castle, I will instruct my guards to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
All right. Plenty of time to come up with punishments along the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(whining)<br />
But, John&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thumb screws, you like them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(content)<br />
Yes. Thumb screws are good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(lower, to McKay)<br />
We better find some cover. That backup-he called is going to be here any minute.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gestures Harmony to get in front of him as he watches the rear.]
</p><p>[Some time later, Sheppard finds a sheltered area of fallen trees within the larger forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, this will work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Those were Genii!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I picked up on that, Rodney. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[They crouch amongst the fallen trunks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So what are the Genii doing here? And why do they want to kill her? I mean, aside from the obvious reasons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Harmony?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I don't know. I don't like the Genii.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But you know who they are. Are you trading partners?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Not anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(glowering)<br />
But you were.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Yes. But they cheated my mother on many trades. She banished them from our land.</blockquote>

No! Absolutely not!</blockquote>

If I were to die, my sister would succeed me. But if the Genii think that she would be more willing to trade than me, they are sadly mistaken.</blockquote>

You really believe that Ladon would give the marching orders to kill a little girl? Even this one?</blockquote>

Hey, hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa! We'll handle this, all right?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay has found the scanner and squints to try and steady his aim.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I got it. It's okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No really, j-just&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
&#8230;Steady&#8230;Come to papa&#8230;Let's go&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[In one fell swoop, Sheppard snatches the gun from McKay and shoots the guard. He falls. Harmony gets up to approach, but Sheppard pulls her back down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
What?!</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony, staring at Sheppard, does not notice the second Genii soldier coming into view, looking confusedly down at his comrade.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You have subdued him.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stuns the second guard before he can defend himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now we can go.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay hurry down. Harmony stands and smiles, then follows.]
</p><p>[At the ruins, McKay stares at the pillar of the "Temple" in wonder. Sheppard goes to disarm the guards.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fascinating!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ancient?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls out his scanner to check the pillar. A crystal panel is open; the first stunned Genii had been working on the device.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, obviously. It's weird. This place seems strangely familiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It's even more beautiful than I imagined.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony goes to a small pedestal in front of the pillar and pulls out a pendant. Clutching the stone, she places her hand on the pedestal. After a moment, she stares at her necklace worriedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Something's wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It's not working!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shouldn't you be&#8230;like&#8230;silently meditating or something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(disappointed)<br />
My pendant. It's supposed to glow.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'll be damned.</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries over to Harmony with his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let me guess&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yeah. It's Ancient.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It's the Pendant of Laros. The queen, and only the true queen, must return it to the ruins. Once here, it is to glow and imbue me with great power!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Your sisters kind of failed to mention that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It is one of our greatest secrets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(inspired)<br />
It's the testing ground!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
I know what this place is! I've been reading about it. Hell, we've been looking for it for the last two years! I-I've seen the schematics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Share with the class..?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, believe it or not, this place actually does control the beast&#8212;if the beast is what I think it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mini-drones if I'm right; and you know, you can usually take that to the bank. I mean, this planet must have been where the Ancients first developed drone technology. It was their main testing ground!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That would explain why the Genii looked like Swiss cheese. The mini-drones went right through 'em!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And that noise the beast was making? It was more like an electric swarm than a&#8212;than a growl.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So the pendant is, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Probably some sort of pass-key. I mean, the Ancient's weren't above protecting their research, even from each other. Look, you need more than just the gene in order to activate or control the drones, otherwise&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[To Harmony's alarm, McKay shoves her hand off the pedestal. He studies the pedestal.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
&#8230;Yes, yes, yes, yes. Of course! It's in auto-protect mode. They're trolling the forest, taking out anybody without the gene. That's why they&#8230;stayed clear of us and went straight for the Genii. Look, the&#8230;royal pain here must have it as well.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony stares bemusedly at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then why isn't it working?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(indicating the downed Genii)<br />
Well, maybe because genius over there was messing with the crystal tray?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, so, give me a second to figure out how much damage he's done.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts adjusting the crystals and working his scanner. Harmony closes her eyes and furrows her face in intense concentration while she holds the pedestal. Sheppard approaches her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The machine is&#8230;broken; that's why your pendant isn't glowing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(upset)<br />
It's got nothing to do with machines. If I am worthy of being queen, the gods will bestow the power of pure light and make my pendant glow!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, who knows what kind of wacky rules they've imposed on it. I mean, I suppose it's possible that once a generation, the key needs to be reactivated here. Maybe it's the one thing that, uh, allows them to use the Ancient tech they have back at the castle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It-it's complicated, but it-it will light up. We just need to make some&#8230;repairs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You don't understand. I've failed. Maybe I'm not supposed to be queen. Maybe&#8230;maybe we've come all this way for nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Trust me, it-it'll glow.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony turns away and sits on the Temple floor, clutching her pendant and moping. Sheppard heads over to the Genii soldiers, who are starting to stir. Sheppard nudges one with his boot, holding his gun on them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wake up. What'd you do to this thing?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay joins them.]
</p>
<blockquote>GENII SCIENTIST<br />
(scared)<br />
I'm not sure. I just rearranged the crystals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HURON<br />
Don't tell them a thing. They're going to kill us one way or the other.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you get it to work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not quickly. I mean, I can come back with a jumper and a small team and get it working.</blockquote>
<p>[While McKay guards the men, Sheppard rejoins to Harmony.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Listen&#8230;we're going to head back&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
No! If I return with a darkened pendant, I won't be allowed to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Yes, you will be queen, I promise you! It's just busted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
This isn't the type of thing where you get a second chance, John. Please. I can do it. I just-I just need to focus more.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes back to the pedestal and desperately attempts to activate it again.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
(distantly over radio)<br />
Huron&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Huron reaches for his radio, but Sheppard is instantly there, pointing the stunner.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa! Easy does it.</blockquote>
<p>[Huron slowly passes the radio over to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Huron come in&#8230;Huron, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If we don't respond, they're going to come and investigate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with deeper voice, into Genii radio)<br />
Huron here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
What's your status.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with deep voice, into radio)<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Elaborate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with deep voice, into radio)<br />
Real good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HURON<br />
(crying out)<br />
Help us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SCIENTIST<br />
Help us!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stuns them both.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Huron!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(regular voice, into radio, quickly)<br />
Kinda busy, gotta go.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns off the radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well it was worth a shot. You gotta get that thing working, fast!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why can't we just run for it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're boxed in from all directions! We've gotta get those mini drones working, or&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scared)<br />
Or we die.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony desperately tries to get her pendant to work.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Genii run towards the ruins.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;TEMPLE OF LAROS RUINS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on the crystal control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(calling to Sheppard)<br />
You know, you're not exactly inspiring confidence.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks up from the fallen stone pillar where he's taken a protected position with his weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah? How so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're hiding behind a foot of solid rock. How am I supposed to feel out here with only a cool breeze between me and the Genii?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're more than welcome to come and get cover for yourself&#8230;as soon as you're done with those repairs.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony is settled beside Sheppard, well protected.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(irked)<br />
Do you have any idea how many crystal placement combinations there are?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
More than seven?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Try seven thousand!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's less than infinite.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's scanner beeps, and he sighs in frustration.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Harmony)<br />
All right, look. It's going to get very, very noisy when the Genii get here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Screaming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(taps his rifle)<br />
No, these guns. They make a lot of noise. It's very important that you stay put and keep your ears covered, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Shouldn't you give me a gun instead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sternly)<br />
You're going to stay put, cover your ears, and you're not gonna move, okay?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's scanner beeps and the Ancient pillar gives off a steady hum.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(triumphant)<br />
Son of a bitch! I think I got it!</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony rushes out to the pedestal.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Harm&#8212;Harmony! What did I just say?</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to go after her just as gunfire strafes the area. McKay ducks as bullets strike the pillar near his head. Sheppard pauses and returns fire. McKay dives for cover, knocking Harmony to the ground under him.]
</p><p>[The Genii take positions around the temple. McKay looks up to see Harmony's frightened face staring at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Go! Go, go, go go!</blockquote>
<p>[He shoves Harmony back towards the protection of the fallen pillar while he provides cover fire, then follows her. Sheppard and the Genii continue to exchange fire as McKay takes a position behind the rock. The gunfire stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
(calling to them)<br />
You're surrounded! You have limited ammunition, and I have unlimited men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll take our chances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
If you make this hard, I will make your death as slow and as painful as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay&#8230;what's option number two?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
Give us the girl, and we'll let you go free.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Never! They would rather die than deal with the likes of you savages! When my sisters hear of this, the Genii will be finished! Finished, do you hear!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay roll their eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
How do you think we knew how to find you little one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You lie! Come at us with all you have! I shall silence you once and for all!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(hissing to Harmony)<br />
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Let us handle this, okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Teran pauses, but hears nothing more.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
You have one minute!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, McKay, and Harmony congregate, all speaking low.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
It can't be true!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It doesn't matter right now, to be honest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
How can you say that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Did you get that thing working?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well yeah, before they started shooting at it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So it's broken again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it was powered up. Fifty-fifty chance it's still operational.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Provide me with cover. I'll make it to the pedestal, summon the beast, and smite them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
There will be no "smiting" today, little lady. You've never even used that thing before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I am the queen, and the beast is my protector!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a little more complicated than that.</blockquote>
<p>[He pauses, struck by a thought.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay, shrewdly)<br />
You say anyone with the Ancient gene can activate it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, as long as they're wearing the&#8230;pendant.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks from Sheppard to Harmony, following Sheppard's thought. Harmony remains oblivious.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Fifty-fifty, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
One hundred percent chance they'll kill us if we talk about it for much longer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sighing)<br />
You got a full mag there?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay checks his weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Locked and loaded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On three?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Yes. Excellent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One&#8230;two&#8230;three.</blockquote>
<p>[He snatches the pendant off Harmony's neck as he says three and runs for the pedestal. McKay provides cover fire. Harmony gasps in shock. Sheppard activates the pedestal, the pendant in his hand. Mini-drones swarm the area. The Genii cease fire as they warily stare at the humming drones flying everywhere. Teran stares at the drones, but sees Sheppard standing in the open.]
</p>
<blockquote>TERAN<br />
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!</blockquote>
<p>[His men are too distracted by the drones. Teran raises his pistol, and Sheppard sees him; he directs the mini-drones to attack. The drones knock Teran down, killing him. The other Genii flee. Sheppard powers down the pedestal. McKay and Harmony run over.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I'm good. You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sure, sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(in awe)<br />
That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(cocky)<br />
You're young. I'm sure you'll meet even braver men than me as you get older.</blockquote>
<p>[Harmony snatches back her pendant.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(furious)<br />
Not you, usurper! You're lucky I like you, or you would be hung for treason!<br />
(to McKay)<br />
But you&#8230;you saved my life.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay both look stunned at this change in Harmony.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
I did?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
When the Genii started firing at me, you threw yourself on me, using your own body as a shield.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard makes a face and walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I just-I tripped and&#8230;fell on top of you. It was an accident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
And then&#8230;you pulled me to safety.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens his mouth, and closes it, eyes still wide as he fidgets uncomfortably.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
You don't&#8230;don't not like me. You like me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
No. No, no, no. I'm&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to Sheppard for help, who just shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Yes! You saved my life and restored the ruins. You are a hero, Doctor McKay, both to me and my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(preening with false modesty)<br />
Well, I don't know about "hero"&#8230;I mean, exceptionally courageous, perhaps.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
And modest, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(piqued)<br />
It's time to go, before the Genii come back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I doubt it. They are a simple people, and I'm sure they were most impressed by your actions. I, however, was not.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange looks. Harmony places her hand on the pedestal. It activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(pleased)<br />
The pendant still glows. The gods have deemed me worthy. <i>Now</i>, we can go.</blockquote>
<p>[She stalks off, McKay and Sheppard roll their eyes and follow.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CASTLE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MARDOLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Mardola reads at her table. The door slams open and guards, followed by Harmony and Flora enter. Mardola stands, smiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
(to Harmony)<br />
You've returned!</blockquote>
<p>[The door shuts, and the guards start to search the room. Mardola looks at them worriedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
(to guards)<br />
What are you doing? These are my private quarters!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
It's all right, Mardola. They've already searched my room. You should allow it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
(angry)<br />
Why?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
The Genii attacked us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
Oh&#8230;well, it was a good thing Colonel Sheppard was there to protect you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FLORA<br />
They knew the location of the ruins, Mardola. How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
You ask as if I would know.</blockquote>
<p>[A guard places the Genii radio he found in Mardola's dresser on the table in front of them. Mardola's eyes widen in fear, and she looks back at Harmony, who's staring at her, hurt and betrayed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARDOLA<br />
You're too young to be queen, Harmony!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
(coldly)<br />
Perhaps&#8230;but when you're released from prison, you'll be too old to remember.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The court is full of people. McKay and Sheppard stand at a red carpet in front of Harmony's throne. Harmony is dressed in a fancy gown with a crown on her head. Flora stands on the lowest tier, to the right of the throne.]
</p>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
Doctor Rodney McKay and Colonel John Sheppard. Your contribution to my people may never be repaid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we didn't do it for compensation, Your Highness-ness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(under his breath)<br />
Kiss-ass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARMONY<br />
I personally owe you a debt of gratitude for your help defeating the regicidal Genii. I've had one of the court's finest artisans feature you in a rendering of our glorious victory.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange pleased looks. Harmony steps towards a curtain behind the throne and nods. Servants pull off the curtain. The court applaud as a large painting is revealed. It pictures McKay in the foreground firing his weapon; Harmony stands in the center, her hand on the temple pedestal, a halo from the beast glowing around her; Sheppard cowers in fright behind Harmony.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, pretty much how I remember it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts to clap as well as Sheppard looks stunned. Harmony grins.]
