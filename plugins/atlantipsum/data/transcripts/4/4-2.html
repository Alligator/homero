</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The city-ship of Atlantis floats in space. The shield covers only the area immediately around the central tower complex. The rest of the city is open to the vacuum of space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard approaches a jumper. Inside, Zelenka works at a panel in the forward compartment while McKay works with a panel in the rear compartment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, when I say, go ahead and try the left one.</blockquote>
<p>[Sparks start to fly, making McKay wince.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh! Geez! I said "when I say"!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(innocently)<br />
I thought you did say!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks up the ramp into the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it goin', boys?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we'd be making a lot more progress if Timmy Torture over here wasn't trying to kill me every two seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm not trying to&#8230;kill him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, can you make it jump into hyperspace or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You "think" so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, think.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You said you could do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Correction, I said "probably" do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, he's having trouble with one of the algorithms he created during his brush with near-ascension.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is unbelievably complex physics here, all right? I mean, it makes string theory look like non-linear dynamics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(blankly)<br />
Okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And even if I do get it working, there's still a thousand things that could go terribly, terribly wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I get it. It's difficult. Million-to-one odds. Blah-blah-blah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Was there something else that you needed, or were you here merely to prod and belittle?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no. Not merely. There's another problem we need to be thinking about. Such as, what do we do when we get there? Getting this thing to jump into hyperspace may be the easy part. Infiltrating the city, stealing the ZPM, and getting out, well, I-I think that's a little dicey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
To say the least.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've been thinking about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And, I think that if we stand any chance of succeeding, we're gonna need some help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
From who?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY ISOLATION WARD</b>
</p><p>[Weir sits up in her hospital bed as Sheppard's team enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Feel like taking a trip?</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The city-ship continues to float in space with the limited shield.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY ISOLATION WARD</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The nanites inside you? I think that if we got them in close proximity to the human-form Replicator city, I'd be able to manipulate them to remotely hack into the Replicator mainframe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'd be able to find out where the closest ZPM is and the quickest way to get in and out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, not only that, we'd be able to track their movement as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We'll know they're coming before they can even spot us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Which does not eliminate the danger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, far from it. But&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But it does give us a significant edge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What happens if the Replicators take control of the nanites inside me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they won't. I would block any attempt&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(interrupting)<br />
But if they do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I ordered Rodney to write a kill switch in the nanites' code. If we trigger the program, it'll neutralize them.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir nods and takes a deep breath, shifting on the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
"Neutralize them." You mean shut them off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you said the nanites are all that are keeping me alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They are. If we shut them off, it will&#8230;kill you. But that's not going to happen. All right? I've ordered Rodney to keep an eye on the little bastards, make sure they behave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We would not ask this of you if it was not the only chance of this mission succeeding.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir gives a small smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's right. If we don't get hold of a ZPM, this city and everyone in it will&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(determined)<br />
When do we leave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right now.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ronon nod to Weir and leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicking)<br />
What? Wait. No-no-no-no-no. Not right now. Look, I haven't finished finalizing the power distrib&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stern, interrupting)<br />
Finalize it. We need to move.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay runs out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're going to be okay, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Still, I would like all of you to keep a very close eye on me. And the first sign of any suspicious behavior, do not hesitate with that kill switch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, but that's not going to happen&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(stern, interrupting)<br />
John, I mean it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reluctantly nods.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard runs to catch up with Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, Teyla! Wait up.</blockquote>
<p>[She pauses and waits for him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going to need you to sit this one out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John, if this mission is not successful&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Zelenka thinks he found a planet that can sustain human life. He's fairly confident that he can get the city there in one jump.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Without the shields, we would be unable to land.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know. We won't even have enough power to establish orbit. You're going to have to do a fly-by and get everybody else in the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You mean, abandon the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if it comes to that. All right, these people are going to need a leader&#8212;somebody who can keep them alive and keep them together, and more importantly, not let them give up hope. That's you, Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(shaking her head)<br />
John&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(continuing)<br />
Look, if I'm not back in twelve hours, give the order.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard jogs off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka work on the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. Now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(hesitantly)<br />
Are you certain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I-I only ask because the last time you were less than definitive in your answer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Radek!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka sets a control. An even humming sounds. Zelenka limps over with his crutch while McKay looks at his computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think we got it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Good, good, now, uh, now as long as we don't burn up all of the power on the initial jump, then&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He pauses as he sees McKay's annoyed expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. Yes. Right. Okay. I'll leave now.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka passes Ronon coming in while he leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Look. I'm still not sure this is going to work. I mean, I've done everything I can to&#8230;make it&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stares at McKay impatiently and keys his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, we're ready.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[Armed security personnel escort Sheppard and Weir through the halls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla stands in the center of the room. Zelenka mans a station next to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over comm)<br />
All right, Teyla. We're ready to launch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into comm)<br />
Understood.<br />
(to Zelenka)<br />
Open the jumper bay doors.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Ronon, McKay, and Weir are inside. Light shines in as the jumper bay doors open above.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comm)<br />
Remember, no wild parties while we're gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(chuckling, over comm)<br />
We will try to restrain ourselves. Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comm)<br />
All right. Here we go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla steps forward, looking concerned as the jumper leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper lifts out of the central port of the city and passes through the shield.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, you ready?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters from the rear compartment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did I mention that this might not work? And that we could either drop out of hyperspace prematurely and end up stranded in the middle of deep space or quite possibly, be vaporized the moment I touch that&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(irritated)<br />
Just answer the damn question!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I'm ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. Sit down. Here goes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes his seat in the copilot's chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Opening hyperspace window in three&#8230;two&#8230;one&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper enters hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, ALIEN PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Carter and McKay step out of the active wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh, my. That's&#8230;that's beautiful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(smiling)<br />
Yeah, it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
It's like Elwynn Forest.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks at him blankly.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh, nothing. It's, uh, one of the lands in <i>Warcraft</i>. That's a game I play. Well, occasionally.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(amused)<br />
Ah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh wow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Are you going to be okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Yeah, yeah. It's just, I don't get to get off-world much&#8230;or ever, hardly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, you'd better take a picture. We're not going to be here long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh, right. Good idea.</blockquote>
<p>[He rummages in his pockets for a camera and starts setting it up.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Colonel Carter calling the <i>Apollo</i>. Colonel Ellis, do you read?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over radio)<br />
Five by five, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
We have stepped through the 'gate and are ready for transport.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
(panicking)<br />
No, wait, wait!</blockquote>
<p>[He fumbles with his camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over radio)<br />
Stand by.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Wait! Ach!</blockquote>
<p>[The pair are beamed away just as Lee raises his camera.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Lee and Carter beam on board the bridge just before Lee snaps the picture of himself. He looks, and is disappointed to see he snapped the shot too late. Ellis stands to great them.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Welcome to the Pegasus Galaxy, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thank you. Still no word from Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Lee exchange worried looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
I've been going over the specs for these modifications you're proposing for the sensor array. You're asking for a five-fold increase in power consumption? Plus, you want to cannibalize parts from half a dozen other key systems including subspace communications?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
That's correct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
What if they try and contact us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(shrugging)<br />
If they could, they would've done it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
All of this is based on the assumption that they dropped out of hyperspace early.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
We believe that's the most likely scenario.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
All right, let's do it.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits. Lee surreptitiously snaps another picture, but the flash goes off. Carter slaps him. Lee shrugs and plays with his camera as they leave the bridge.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper exits hyperspace above the Replicator planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Congratulations, Rodney. Your hyperdrive worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(raising a finger)<br />
Unfortunately, believe it or not, Zelenka was actually right. We burned up way more power on the jump than we expected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What are you saying, we can't get back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, what I'm saying is that the&#8230;actually, that's exactly what I'm saying.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard sigh.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I suppose once we steal the ZPM, I could utilize its power. Then I need to make sure that I don't overload the main&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Let's just take things one step at a time, all right? First things first, let's worry about&#8230;getting the ZPM.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay hunches over his laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.<br />
(to Weir)<br />
Okay, I-I'm going to try to initialize the link.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What do you want me to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nothing. Just sit there. It's completely wireless. Let me know if anything pops into your mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(befuddled)<br />
What do you mean? Uh, will I&#8230;just sort of sense something? Or is it more of a&#8230;oh my god.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir pauses. Replicator code appears within her mind's eye.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I did it! I mean, well&#8230;she did it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances back at Weir, who's concentrating intently.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But we need to move fast. Even though Elizabeth's nanites are only in lurking mode, it won't take long for the Replicators to figure out another player has joined the game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How you feeling, Elizabeth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Very strange. I can suddenly see the entire city directly in front of me&#8212;I mean, every corridor, every single room&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard grins. Weir points out the window at a tower.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That way. The ZPM. Fourth quadrant, top level. Easy access. There's hardly anyone around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Works for me.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies to a low-level tower.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Ronon jumps up to leave as the jumper lands on the roof.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we're down. Rodney, stay here with Elizabeth. Keep sifting through the intel. You guys can guide us through by radio.</blockquote>
<p>[He joins Ronon in the rear as they prep their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Twenty meters to the left behind the jumper, there's an access door. Down one flight of stairs, you'll enter auxiliary corridor seven.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay, Sheppard, and Ronon all stare at Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go now. It's clear.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard hesitantly nods at Weir as he and Ronon leave. McKay watches Weir worriedly for a moment before bending down to his laptop again.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CORRIDOR SEVEN</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard move down the steps and pause at the entrance to the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're at the corridor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Go right. At 6.5 meters, there should be another corridor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Okay, we see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Turn left. Wait! Go back.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon duck out of sight just as a Replicator walks by.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's all right. He didn't see you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really? You-you know that?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir snaps out of her trance for a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah. Like I said, it's very strange.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CORRIDOR SEVEN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatiently, into radio)<br />
Can we go now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes. Go.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon run down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Turn left, then right.</blockquote>
<p>[They comply, checking the coast is clear before opening a door and entering.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
It should be directly in front of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yep, I see it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ZPM ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They enter a small room with one control panel and a spot for one ZPM. Ronon is already reaching for it when Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hold up, Chewie.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Aren't they going to notice when we pull the plug on this thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Probably, but they've got dozens of ZPMs. Let's just hope that they don't&#8230;notice until we're long gone.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
That's wishful thinking. We still in the clear?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There's a small group of Replicators two corridors over, heading your way, so you need to move quickly.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ZPM ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard activates the device to extract the ZPM and hands it to Ronon, who packs it in the small case.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Got it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're on our way.</blockquote>
<p>[They head quickly out, closing the door behind them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CORRIDOR SEVEN</b>
</p><p>[They run through the corridor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hook up the ZPM. We're leaving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a minute, we can't go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about? You said you could get the hyperdrive back on-line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected, I-I've been going over the Replicators' base code, and I found this.</blockquote>
<p>[He shows them a display on his laptop of Replicator code.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
The Holy Grail. It's their whole reason for being. It's a command code that directs them to attack the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But they don't attack the Wraith. They've been sitting on their nanite asses for ten thousand years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that's because it's been deactivated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And how did that happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I have no idea. Look, maybe the Ancients did it when they realized they couldn't control them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And you-you're just noticing this now, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is just one in millions of commands in the base code. Look, I always had a hunch that something like this might be in there, but-but, believe me, it was not easy to find.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can you reactivate it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. But there's a problem. Look, I can reprogram the nanites in your brain and use that link to upload the changes, but we'll need to wait for the next merge to affect all the Replicators at once, and&#8230;we have no idea when that could be. Not only that, but the instant it happens, they'll know you're there, they'll take immediate steps to assimilate you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then we're not doing it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
John, you know what this could mean. If the Replicators go to war with the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Forget about it. It's not happening.</blockquote>

The hell it isn't!</blockquote>
<p>[He sits in the pilot's chair and preps to leave. Ronon also sits.]

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. There may be another way. There's a central data core. Look, it-it-it's kind of like a&#8230;backup hard drive for all the Replicators. If I can upload the reactivated attack command directly into that, then we wouldn't need to use Elizabeth. We could&#8230;be halfway back to Atlantis when the attack command takes effect at the next merge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interested)<br />
That sounds a little more like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. There is one small problem&#8230;which is not actually a small problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The core's at the center of the city, several levels down. It would be impossible to get there undetected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. We're gonna have to come back after we take the ZPM back to Atlantis and after we land the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I don't think we'll have another chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He's right. Once they notice the ZPM is missing, they'll be able to trace the source of the infiltration. I will never get this kind of undetected access again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
If we're gonna do this? It's now or never.</blockquote>
<p>[The decision, made, Sheppard flies through the city. McKay tries to hook the ZPM into they newly installed hyperdrive. Ronon sits nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're going to turn the cloak into an anti-replicator field?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, by interfacing the ARG's control crystal with the jumper's cloaking generator. The only question is how far I can widen the field.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
 Look, go ahead and fly us as close to the center of the city as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(pointing to a spot)<br />
There.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
But won't we be visible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, we will. The anti-replicator field will protect us. That is&#8230;assuming that I can extend the field wide enough to encompass not only the jumper, but also the core room, and&#8230;also assuming that we can run fast enough to get there, input the command, and get back before the Replicators figure out how to overrun the field and-and-and&#8230;you know, slaughter us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't worry about it. You're not coming with us. Neither is Elizabeth.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry, what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You guys can guide us through by radio like you did last time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a minute. If I'm not there, how are we supposed to input the command?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Put it on a tablet. I'll plug it into the core and upload it myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, plug and play, huh? What, you think it's that simple?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it will be because you're gonna make it that simple.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where's Doctor Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Her attempts to seize control of the collective proved too taxing for her, rendering her mind and body virtually moribund. She has been taken to be&#8230;repaired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're going to take control of her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
That has already occurred. Unfortunately, I was not able to glean all the information I need from her. So, I will have to extract it from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Information?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
About the precise location of Atlantis. You left your planet before we were able to destroy it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(deadpan)<br />
Well, sorry to spoil your plans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
Nothing is spoiled. Merely&#8230;prolonged. And now with your help, we will complete the destruction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Seeing how none of us will volunteer the information&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
You know quite well that we have a simple method for extracting what we need.</blockquote>
<p>[Oberoth signals with his head, and the cell shield lowers and the door opens. Oberoth and others enter the cell. Two guards force Sheppard to his knees. Another holds a weapon on Ronon to prevent his interference. Sheppard winces as Oberoth enters his head. Oberoth winces, redoubling his concentration. Sheppard looks unconcerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Problems?</blockquote>
<p>[Oberoth looks around. McKay and Ronon smirk at him. Oberoth pulls out his hand. Sheppard morphs into Weir.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;OBEROTH'S MIND</b>
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(shocked)<br />
What?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I figured, you messed with our minds, so I'd mess with yours. You didn't overpower me, Oberoth. The Replicator guards didn't capture my team. It was all a fictional scenario played out in your mind. In reality, your guards are still frozen, and my team is escaping as we speak. You were wrong, Oberoth. I have never underestimated you, but you have clearly underestimated me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
(furious)<br />
You will not leave this city alive!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Maybe not. But my team will.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon run down the corridor where in Oberoth's fiction, the Replicators came to life. This time they have no problems.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Still nothing from Elizabeth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
No. I can't communicate with her. I can't track her. It's like she just-just disappeared.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If she's the one who froze the Replicators, that means she's probably still alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
For the moment, maybe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, she can't be that far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We'll find her.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You'd better make it fast. These Replicators could unfreeze at any moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio, sarcastic)<br />
Thanks, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;OBEROTH'S MIND</b>
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
I admire your tenacity, but I won't be fooled again.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir gulps, looking strained. Oberoth studies her.]
</p>
<blockquote>OBEROTH<br />
You're struggling, Doctor Weir.</blockquote>
<p>[They both redouble their efforts. Oberoth reaches out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Oberoth grabs Weir's arm and starts to force her hand out of his head. Sheppard and Ronon arrive, aiming their weapons at Oberoth, but unable to get a clear shot because of Weir's position.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Elizabeth&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Get to the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're coming with us.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon fires at Oberoth, but he stays in position.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I can't keep them frozen much longer!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not leaving you behind!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If you don't leave right now, none of us will get out of here, so go! That's an order.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir half turns her head to look at him. Oberoth seizes the opportunity to regain control. The Replicators unfreeze and start firing at Sheppard and Ronon, forcing them to fall back.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Come on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Elizabeth?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
GO!</blockquote>
<p>[Replicators surround Weir as Sheppard and Ronon retreat.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon race in, startling McKay who's working with the ZPM.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, thank god!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon closes the door behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Elizabeth?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shakes his head. McKay stands, stunned.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can we cloak? Rodney, can we cloak?!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay snaps out of his fugue state.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. Not yet. No, we-we drained too much power trying to convert the cloak into an AR field. Look, I-I'll try to interface the ZPM, but we're gonna need some time.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard powers up the jumper as McKay gets to work.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we'll just have to make a run for it, then.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS, DAY</b>

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(tightly)<br />
How's hyperspace looking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not good. Look, harnessing power from the ZPM is tricky. If I'm off even just the slightest amount, then we could all&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

Two ships headed our way.</blockquote>
<p>[The jumper is rocked by a blast.]
</p>

Look, I need more time!</blockquote>
<p>[More explosions rock the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We just lost weapons!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dammit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Come on, McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is not simple, you know! If I don't properly calibrate the power output, we could incinerate the moment the hyperspace window opens!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm picking up something dead ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[A Replicator jumper uncloaks directly in front of them blocking their path.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, crap. They're powering up weapons!</blockquote>
<p>[The <i>Aurora</i>-style battle cruiser is attacked by weapons on its port side. Sheppard and the others look, but can't see the source from their vantage point.]
</p>

What the hell was that?</blockquote>

Affirmative. The 302 bay is open, and you have permission to come aboard. I suggest you hurry.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here's a good one. M35-117.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Does Doctor Weir know about it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's not on our primary or our backup lists. I purposely searched for planets we'd never considered before. The, uh, Replicators can probe her mind all they want, they won't find it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good&#8230;for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(subdued)<br />
Well, look, it's a stable atmosphere, a big ocean, besides the, uh, large, particularly venomous snake-like creature that inhabits the mainland, it looks to be a welcoming environment.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Lee exchange looks. Sheppard shrugs his approval.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Radek, how we doin?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We did it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there's still the small matter of landing this thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. I'll just jump in the chair and ease us down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, that could be tricky. We drained a lot of power from the ZPM just getting here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have we got enough energy to keep the shield up for reentry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There better be. What, a city this size will create considerable friction. We come in too fast or too steep, and the shield could attenuate under the stress and the whole place could be torn to shreds, or-or burn up, or both?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks askance as she glances at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It never ends with you, you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>

<p>[McKay sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The angle's too steep. We keep going like this, we're gonna put too much strain on the shield, which means more power draining from the ZPM.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, we're coming in too steep. You need to ease up on the angle of reentry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
In fact, you mean entry. You see, we never actually left this&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />

You want to touch down gently, like a&#8230;leaf kissing the surface of a pond.</blockquote>
<p>[The ship continues to shake. A sharp impact knocks everyone around.]

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla picks up a photograph of Weir's dog Sedgewick on the desk and studies it. Ronon enters. Teyla packs the photo in a box, following it with Weir's laptop. Ronon enters quietly and slowly.]

<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who do you think's gonna replace her?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs heavily.]
</p>

Right.</blockquote>
<p>[He dials the Stargate, which activates. Zelenka glances over upon hearing the kawhoosh and breaks out into a smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into comm)<br />
This is Atlantis calling Stargate Command. Do you read?</blockquote>
<p>[There is no answer at first, and they exchange nervous looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SGC TECHNICIAN<br />
We read you, Atlantis. It's good to hear from you.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs in relief. Carter breaks into a grin.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Great to be heard! Tell General Landry we're back on the grid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(nervous)<br />
Rodney&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Long range scanners have detected a massive fleet of ships being launched from the Replicator planet&#8230;</blockquote>

<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
But they're not heading for us.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies the display.]

Actually, there are five. It's just these are the only two visible to the naked eye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Huh. I heard you and Rodney got us reconnected to the intergalactic bridge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yep. General Landry was understandably relieved to hear from us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, in all the excitement, I never got a chance to congratulate you.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Your promotion. You're a full bird colonel now.</blockquote>
<p>[He playfully salutes her. She nods, looking embarrassed.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ah. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, you sticking around?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No. General Landry wants Doctor Lee and I to 'gate back, give him a full briefing on the situation here. The <i>Apollo</i> 's going to remain in orbit for the time being in case you need any assistance.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods thoughtfully.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thanks for saving our asses back there from the bad guys. That was a risky move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It was nothing compared to the risk that you and your team took. Frankly, I'm amazed you were able to pull it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging, uncomfortably)<br />
We had a lot of help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sighing)<br />
Yeah. General Landry sends his condolences. He was deeply saddened to hear about Doctor Weir&#8230;we all were.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I haven't given up hope. If there's a chance she's still alive, I'll find her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I know.</blockquote>
