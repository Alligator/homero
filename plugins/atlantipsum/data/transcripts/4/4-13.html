<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard watches the applause for the ending of a computer golf game on one console as McKay fidgets and grooms himself nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, dude, one more round.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nope, I can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We don't have to do eighteen. We can do nine, easy course, par three.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nope, Katie's expecting me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, be late. Women like it when guys are late.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stops his grooming and walks over, looking pleased.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, they don't. And I can't be late&#8212;not for this lunch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can you keep a secret?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(not listening)<br />
Right. I, uh, I got this&#8230;on my last trip to Earth.</blockquote>
<p>[He shows Sheppard a ring, still in its box. It is a very small diamond embedded in a plain silver or platinum band.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I feel it's time that, uh, Katie and I moved the relationship to the next level.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Second base?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. Marriage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shocked)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(incredulous)<br />
You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Married?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, you don't think I'm ready? You think I'm-I'm rushing things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't say that&#8230;!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well-well, I'm not. I'm not ready to set a date or anything, but, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard studies the ring closer, noticing the tiny stone.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is this a diamond?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, eighth of a carat, actually. Conflict-free and um, I got a good deal, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(drily)<br />
I'm sure you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right&#8230;so&#8230;here I go&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He takes off his radio headset and lays it on the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I-I'll buy you a beer later. We can celebrate&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, or, uh, drown my sorrows should she say no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(bracingly)<br />
No, no, none of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, go get the girl!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay heads out, meeting Teyla on her way in. Teyla's pregnancy is obviously showing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodn&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can't talk.</blockquote>
<p>[He hurries out.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John&#8230;do you have a moment to talk?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller spots Ronon entering with a bloodied arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Another sparring accident?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Actually, I slipped in the shower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Nah. Sparring accident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This is the third time this week I've had to patch you up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You know, there are a lot of other ways you can spend your free time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not as much fun, though.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shakes her head as she puts on rubber gloves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and Carter meet outside an elevator transporter.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Hi, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Doctor! Where you headed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Control room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh, me too. We can share.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Splendid.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens, and they wait for it to empty before entering.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay wanders through the outer lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Katie?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
I'm in here!</blockquote>
<p>[He finds her in an inner part of the lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great! Awesome! I hope you're hungry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh, I am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Yeah, me too. Very hungry. Hungry, hungry, hungry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm&#8230;fine. Uh&#8230;yeah&#8230; Wow, this is much more, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Katie comes closer. McKay is swaying, shifting nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
You're sweating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(wiping his brow)<br />
Oh, am I? I suppose I am. Okay, um, I guess I-I should, uh, jump right into this. You know, rip the band-aid off, as they say&#8230;not-not that this is painful in any way. It's quite the opposite, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(laughing)<br />
Rodney, what's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's nothing. In-in fact, everything's right&#8230;with us, I mean. So, I-I was thinking&#8230;I don't know about you, but-but the way I see it, um, I thought that, uh, maybe&#8230;it's time that we&#8230;you know&#8230;start entertaining the notion&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches into his pocket for the ring box. Suddenly klaxons blare and the door to the outer lab seals shut.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[As Keller treats Ronon's arm, the doors seal shut, closing them off from other areas of the infirmary.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SCIENCE LAB</b>
</p><p>[Two scientists look up as their door seals them into the lab.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Personnel look alarmed as the doors everywhere close.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[A heavy door lowers, sealing Teyla and Sheppard inside the lab.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Katie hurry to the door, the former trying the controls. The doors remain shut.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
What happened? Why'd the doors close?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to pry open the doors. Katie helps, to no effect.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(concerned)<br />
Rodney, what's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
It's locked. We're trapped.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard try and open a side door, to no avail.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are locked in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, come in!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller tries one door as Ronon struggles with another one.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This one's locked, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What the hell is going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Doctor McKay, this is Doctor Keller. Are you there?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka checks the door controls while Carter studies the back control panel and keys her radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, this is Sam, do you read?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(closing the panel)<br />
The control mechanism is not responding. Perhaps I can physically open the door.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter moves to help him try and pry open the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Transporter doors are lighter; they're not nearly as heavy as other doors in the city.</blockquote>
<p>[They both grunt as they use brute force to no effect.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
<i>Curses in Czech.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, this is Sam, please respond.</blockquote>
<p>[There is only open static on the radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?<br />
(to Zelenka)<br />
Are you getting anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No. Communications must be down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh, great.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(snapping his fingers)<br />
All right, I'm gonna need a radio. I left mine in the lab.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Uh, radio? It's in there.</blockquote>
<p>[She points to the door they're trying to open.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean? What, you don't have a radio in here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
It's a plant cultivation room. We haven't needed one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you need one now! Look, that alarm was a quarantine lockdown!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Quarantine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Atlantis's, uh, self-protection against another outbreak. It's sealing off sections of the city to prevent the spread of a disease. I, uh, tweaked the, uh, system after the recent Kirsan fever outbreak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
But&#8230;there was no lockdown during that outbreak.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay paces nervously, looking around.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, hence the need to tweak the system, you know? Institute more vigorous protocols. Okay, I need to get to a computer, assess the degree of the situation. I mean, is this just a few sections that have been sealed off, or, uh, maybe the whole tower&#8230;? Computer's in the other room, isn't it?</blockquote>
<p>[Katie nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
With the radio&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Katie shrugs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon tries to pry open the door to no avail.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
there must be another disease outbreak. McKay said he was going to modify the quarantine system to make it more efficient.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How does cutting off the radios make it more efficient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Obviously, there's a glitch in the program. Problem is, without communications, he can't tell me how bad the outbreak is or give me the pass-codes to open whichever doors are deemed safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Ah, great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, in any case, I should be ready to treat the sick when they bring them in. Will you help me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Tell me what to do.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard studies the sealed door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I could really use Ronon's gun right about now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John, look.</blockquote>
<p>[He comes back over to the computers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It appears there's been another outbreak.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pulls up a schematic of the base and read-outs on the main screen, deleting the "golf program" still there.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is a&#8230;"category five?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm guessing it's a lot worse than categories one through four. We could be here a while.</blockquote>
<p>[He glances nervously at Teyla's protruding abdomen. Teyla catches his glance.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's just that every time one of these things happens in the movies, the pregnant woman goes into labor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm still a long way from my due date.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, it's the same thing in the movies, and then "wham."</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Relax, John. I will be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why don't you sit down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Y-y-you know, just to be on the safe side, let's sit down.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rolls over a stool. Teyla humors him, sighing.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's see what else we can find out.</blockquote>
<p>[He continues typing into the computer.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Zelenka both heave heavy sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Quarantine lockdown.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, I don't know why communications would be affected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, Rodney did say he was going to modify some of the Ancient protocols. Perhaps he made a mistake&#8212;made the, uh, security measures a little too aggressive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We need to try to access the mainframe.</blockquote>
<p>[She picks up Zelenka's computer from the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but unfortunately, that's all you'll be able to do. This tablet has limited RAM. It's configured mainly for read-only field diagnostics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, we should at least be able to determine the extent of the lockdown.</blockquote>
<p>[She turns the computer on. The screen instantly shows a picture of a pigeon.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, oh sorry. That-that's one of my pigeons.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes the computer and shuts off the image of the pigeon. Carter studies him.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I-I raise them&#8230;as a hobby&#8230;back home?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Ah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Let's see what we have here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You comfortable? You want anything? You want to lie down? Eat?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is what I wanted to talk to you about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Your decision to remove me from the team's missions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not going to go through this again, are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, no, no. It-it's all right. I-I understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not permanent. You-you're just going to have to ease off, then you have your baby, and&#8230;in a few months, you're back in action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Will I be? If it is wrong to place myself and my unborn child in danger now, will it be any less to do so when he is born? John, it's bad enough that my son may grow up without a father, but if I were to be hurt&#8230;or killed? He would be left without a mother as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's tough, I know. I got a friend from college, she's a cop, three kids. She goes through this every day when she goes to work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How does she make peace with herself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well&#8230;she figures, she's fighting bad guys, keeping them off the streets, so not only is she protecting her kids, she's protecting other kids, too.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look&#8230;you have to understand&#8230;your child has a family here, in case anything ever happens.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla replies with a wan smile.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and Carter pour over the readout.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Category five?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The entire city?! Either this disease spreads more rapidly than anything I've ever encountered before, or&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER AND ZELENKA<br />
Something's wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(continuing)<br />
Yeah, look at the levels. Primary&#8230;secondary systems&#8230;Look, wild fluctuations in every sector.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Other systems are down too, not just communications. Long-range scanners are out. Ventilation in several areas, including this tower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, oh, and plumbing too! Oh, dear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It's like the city's entire operating system is on the fritz. Oh, this may not even be a lockdown at all. This entire lockdown could be the result of a malfunction. Don't worry, I'm sure McKay is sitting at a workstation fixing this problem as we speak.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[Katie and McKay stand helplessly by a plant table.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
I'm sure others are working on the problem. Doctor Keller, Doctor Zelenka&#8230;Colonel Carter&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Oh they better be.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon tries to use an i.v. pole to pry open the doors. It snaps in his arms. Keller races over from another section.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey.</blockquote>
<p>[She studies his injury. The wound is bleeding heavily through the bandage.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(scolding)<br />
You tore your stitches! Gah, honestly, I don't think I've met anyone with such reckless aggression.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller leads him over to the beds and goes to get some supplies. Ronon smirks at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That's not a compliment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If you say so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Lay [sic] down.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon does so. Keller puts on gloves to treat the wound.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, look, I don't think we're going to have any luck opening those doors on our own. We're probably just better off waiting for McKay and the others to&#8230;figure out what needs to be done and-and which doors are even safe to be open.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So we're just supposed to sit here and wait?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yes! And&#8230;be ready at a moment's notice to&#8230;treat the sick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(smiling)<br />
I'm not very good at sitting and waiting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(scoffing)<br />
No kidding. Well, maybe we could pass the time by&#8230;getting to know each other better.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon studies her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What do you have in mind?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller stops treating his wound as she realizes Ronon's supine position. Her eyes widen.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(flustered)<br />
Oh! I-I mean, I didn't&#8230;you know, I meant, just, like&#8230;talk. I didn't mean&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon gives a wry smile and nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(still flustered)<br />
Yeah, so, anyway, um&#8230;let's talk.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks around blankly. Keller gives a pained smile.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BOTONY LAB</b>
</p><p>[Katie attempts to try and pull off the door panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Can't you fiddle with this and get the door open?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I could "fiddle with it", sure. As to actually getting the door open? Not a chance. The quarantine protocol completely disables the door's control mechanisms. The whole point of it is to keep people from getting out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Oh, it's going to be okay. Doctor Keller and Zelenka have&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicking)<br />
We don't know that! We have no idea if it's going to be okay. For all we know,  Zelenka and Keller could already be infected! We don't even know how much of the city is in quarantine! If this is serious, and we have no reason to believe otherwise, we could be looking at a city-wide lockdown.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(crossing her arms)<br />
You are thinking the worst case scenario.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
<i>Hello?</i> This is what I do! Someone needs to think ahead to the worst possible outcome to any situation in order to properly defend against it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Any situation? Even the good ones?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, it doesn't take much for a-a good situation to-to turn ugly. One minute you're happily riding your bicycle back from acing your Lagrangian Mechanics midterm, you know, the warm breeze in your face, next thing you know, you're flying through the air 'cause you just hit a pothole.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie lowers her arms and walks closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(sympathetically)<br />
Aw, Rodney, did that happen to you?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay paces, walking past Katie's attempted embrace without noticing. She looks nonplussed as she ends up just brushing his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The point is, one must always be on guard, you know? Always looking out for the potholes. Now, you can-you can call me a catastrophist, but it's a&#8230;necessary burden I bear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
A mindset like that, and a person would live in a constant fate of worry and fear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(despondently)<br />
You forgot despair.</blockquote>
<p>[He sighs.]

Well, it's definitely a malfunction, and surprisingly, it's nothing Rodney did. Look at that, I'm reading a sudden spike in power caused by an intense ionospheric storm earlier today.

<p>[Ronon picks it up and moves it over to where he has the other tank set up leaning against a scanner while on a bed. Another bed sits at a ninety degree angle facing the door. After placing the other tank on the other bed and checking his setup, he joins Keller in the inner area and the crouch on the other side of the door. Ronon starts working with buttons on a scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right. You ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon presses the final sequence. The scanner starts to move. The first oxygen tank falls onto the other, right where the valve is scored. The tank starts to ricochet around the room like a rocket. It finally stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They get up and go around the corner. The infirmary is in shambles, but the door remains solidly closed.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare in disappointment.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's a lot stronger than a shark.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sets some C-4 in a doorway, then goes to join Lorne, Banks, and Chuck around a corner.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Fire in the hole.</blockquote>
<p>[He sets off the C-4.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Zelenka jump to their feet, hearing the explosion.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
That was close.</blockquote>
<p>[They listen at the door, then start to pound on it.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hello?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hey! In here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We're in here!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Zelenka's pounding and yelling can be heard by Sheppard's group.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You hear that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The transporter. Somebody's in there.</blockquote>
<p>[They jog to the transporter doors.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Grab a side.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Lorne force the doors open. Zelenka and Carter help. As soon as there's enough of an opening, Zelenka jumps out, gasping for air. Carter follows, breathing deeply.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel. You all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(insulted)<br />
I'm fine, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's no outbreak. It's just a malfunction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We know. Was Rodney the one who finally disabled the self-destruct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, it's still armed, and I haven't heard from Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I need to get to a workstation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Computers are down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We're trying to get to the main power room, so we can physically cut the power to the self-destruct.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But all the doors are sealed shut. We just used the last of our C-4 getting here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Does that mean we're still stuck here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nodding)<br />
That's what it looks like.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How much time is left on the self-destruct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
We don't know. Computers shut down before we could see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So it could happen any time.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck nods. Carter exchanges concerned looks with Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[Katie paces the room, looking at the ring. McKay still lies on the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(smiling, amazed)<br />
You were going to propose to me? Today?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I mean, before the&#8212;before the lockdown.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
So&#8230;? Why don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now? You want me to propose now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(smiling)<br />
Don't you want to hear my answer?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay lies back,.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it doesn't really matter anymore, does it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(stunned)<br />
How can you say that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because we're moments away from our deaths?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Don't talk like that! There's still a chance someone could come through this door&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Katie, please. Enough already. As much as I'd love to believe that someone's going to swoop in and save the day, the fact that no one has tells me it's probably not going to happen. I'm sorry if that's bleak and-and-horrible and fatalistic, but there it is.</blockquote>
<p>[Katie stares at the door, her expression one of sadness and disappointment.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Lorne try a door to no avail.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What are we going to do now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What can we do?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stands on a bench, looking at an air vent near the ceiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Does this vent go to the power room?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes! Yes, I believe at least to the tower's main ventilation flue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, that system's shut down. Those vents will be closed off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Not anymore. We were able to get it back online in most of the tower just before the computers went down.</blockquote>
<p>[Shepaprd pries open the grate. He reaches back and Lorne hands him a flashlight. Sheppard peers inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, it looks clear. It's going to be a tight squeeze, though. There's no way I can move in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'll do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No. I'll do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(determined)<br />
Yes. I'm small enough. I can crawl through there. I'll have the power off in no time.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods and taps him on the arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(conceding)<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Attaboy.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard climbs down from the chair. Zelenka takes his place. Preparing himself and sticking the flashlight in his mouth, he looks back at everyone.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Ready?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Ooop!</blockquote>
<p>[He and Sheppard shove Zelenka into the ventilation shaft, where he begins to crawl.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Keller sit on the floor, leaning against the footboard of an infirmary bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I had you wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
When you first came here&#8230; I thought you were weak. That you didn't belong.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller rolls her eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That's the story of my life. Growing up, I skipped three grades. I graduated at fifteen. Got my bachelor's degree before I was even old enough to vote. I missed out on a lot of things. Any kind of social event. You know, parties. And dances&#8230;I don't ever remember a time in my life where I belonged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well&#8230;blowing up that tank&#8230;you really showed yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller smiles self-deprecatingly.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
But it didn't work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's not the point.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare at each other.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS VENTILATION SHAFTS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
"I'll have the power off in no time." <i>muttering in Czech</i> Idiot! <i>more muttering in Czech.</i></blockquote>
<p>[He reaches a cross-section of vents with a deep hole straight down. Zelenka looks around, then pushes himself to the "downward" vent. He flips himself around to slide down.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Aah.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon shifts closer to Keller, who rests her head on his shoulder comfortably.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[Katie sits on a stool and contemplatively studies McKay, who still lies flat on the floor, waiting for death.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Lorne, and Carter watch the ventilation shaft.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, Radek.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(confidently)<br />
He'll make it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon leans his head closer. Keller looks up at him and smiles.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS POWER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beeps and a timed alarm buzzes as Zelenka falls through the ceiling vent and lands on the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Ah! Oooh!</blockquote>
<p>[He stumbles to his feet, shaking his right hand, and hurries over to the wall, where he starts powering down several huge circuit breakers near the naquadah reactors.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Keller lean in to kiss. The lights go off, distracting them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS POWER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka continues to shut down the last of the circuit breakers, shaking his right hand still.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The lights go off.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(smiling)<br />
He did it.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone exchanges relieved looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS POWER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka resets the circuits, restoring power.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Keller resume what they were doing, but the lights coming on distract them again. They sit upright as they hear the outer door sliding open, freeing them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The lights go on and the door opens behind Carter.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[The blast door raises, freeing Teyla. She leaves with a relieved smile.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[The door to the lab opens. Katie and McKay stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
Oh my god! They found a cure or figured out how to override the program. I don't believe it! We're going to make it! We're not going to die!</blockquote>
<p>[He turns and hugs Katie, who grins and laughs as well, but doesn't return the hug as enthusiastically. They break apart, and McKay notices she's still holding the engagement ring box.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[They both stand, not facing each other, in an awkward silence.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka, Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon sit at a table in the mostly empty room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(skeptical)<br />
You crawled the entire way there, in those tiny vents?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm surprised you even fit in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, he fit all right. There's plenty of room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, not "plenty".</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You should've seen him. He looked like one of those little hamsters in, uh, one of those&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes. The important thing is I was able to make it and shut off the power in time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey, did you hear? McKay thought it was a real outbreak. He even started getting sick; thought he was, um&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He stops talking as he notices Keller approaching. He takes his legs off a spare chair and sits up. Keller glances at him with a sidelong smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hi. Mind if I join you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure, go ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sits up straighter in his seat, sobering the half-smile on his face to a scowl as he notices Sheppard and Teyla watching them with interest.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sharply)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, it's been several hours now, and there is no indication that anyone out there has picked up our alert beacon. I think we're in the clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we should keep an eye out, just in case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Great work, Radek. Everyone on this base owes you a debt of gratitude.</blockquote>
<p>[She clasps him on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(proud)<br />
Well, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay would love this.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone chuckles.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BOTANY LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Katie?</blockquote>
<p>[Katie appears, rolling a cart full of plants, including the <i>Rodneyana Villosa</i>.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Hello, Rodney. I see you're feeling better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, yes, I&#8230;uh&#8230;Well, I mean, uh, it was probably just&#8230;you know&#8230;an allergic&#8230;thing. I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
And the, uh, quarantine. Is it true there was no outbreak?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, no, it was a malfunction. A planetary anomaly&#8212;ionospheric disturbance. I've actually, uh, recalibrated the system, so it'll take into effect future activity so, uh, we should be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Someone said it was Doctor Zelenka that finally turned off the self-destruct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(miffed)<br />
Technically, yes, but it was actually more of a group effort. But that-that's not why I came here. I, um&#8230; Here's the thing. Over the last year and a half, I have become aware that I have certain&#8230;I don't want to use the word "flaws"&#8230;uh&#8230;uh, "shortcomings", perhaps? You know, for example&#8230;on occasion, I-I can be negative&#8230;and-and demanding, and-and a tad arrogant. But, uh, I'm also finding that just being aware of your, uh, shortcomings?&#8230;is-is just the first, minute step on the road to betterment. And the real trick seems to be actually do something about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
I know. It's difficult.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The point is, I came here earlier today to propose marriage to you. But after what happened, I realize that I may have been&#8230;rushing things. I just don't think I'm ready for this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(soberly)<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(nodding)<br />
I don't think I'm ready, either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Okay. Good. That's good. It's not that my feelings have changed or diminished&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
No! No, of course not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just&#8212;I mean&#8230;if we got married now, I would make your life miserable, and-and&#8230;you are far too good a person for that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Don't be so hard on yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Easier said than done, right?</blockquote>
<p>[They share sad smiles, then an awkward silence.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. So, raincheck on lunch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
(with false brightness)<br />
Absolutely.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns to go.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATIE<br />
Bye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(casually)<br />
Bye.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves&#8212;only realizing the air of finality in Katie's tone after a few steps. He turns back to see her sadly watching him go as the door closes.]
