<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Transcript"> Transcript </span></h2>
<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies into high orbit from the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is alone in the cockpit.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comm)<br />
Atlantis, uh, this is Sheppard. I'm on approach to the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes a bite of an apple.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over comm)<br />
Acknowledged.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay stands by one of the control stations.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, since I've been in Pegasus, I have set up, like what, half a dozen research stations on various planets? And I don't remember you ever volunteering to run a resupply mission to any of them.</blockquote>
<p>[The rest of the conversation switches between the control room and puddle jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm a busy man, Rodney. I just happen to have a little free time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And Doctor MacKenzie just happens to be studying a primitive tribe that lives in a tropical paradise and has, how did he put it? "Little or no social inhibitions."</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, they were very friendly.</blockquote>
<p>[An explosion rocks the puddle jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(distracted)<br />
What the hell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(concerned)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard brings up the HUD and studies the display.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think somebody just took a shot at me. I've got contact. They're closing fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Was it Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think so, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Another explosion hits, again rocking the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried)<br />
Whatever they're shooting me with just shorted my systems. I can't get weapons online.</blockquote>
<p>[More shots hit, and the puddle jumper powers down. All the lights and controls darken.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(frantic)<br />
Can you make it back to the 'gate? Sheppard?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney? McKay?!</blockquote>
<p>[The power shutdown has also affected communications. They've lost contact with each other.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A very large ship envelopes the puddle jumper and immediately blasts into hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDORS, TRAVELERS' SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is led through the corridors by two men, Silas and Nevik. Sheppard's hands are bound behind him. The interior of the ship is filled with debris and disuse.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nice ship. Little bit of a fixer-upper, but I can see the potential.</blockquote>
<p>[He trips on a cord.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOLDING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The men open the door to a small room. The lights flicker on. Sheppard is shoved into a room. The men follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not talking about anything drastic, you know. Maybe just a paint job, some throw pillows&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Nevik wrenches Sheppard's arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<p>[Nevik injects Sheppard's arm, taking a vial of blood. When finished he releases Sheppard, tapping him on the arm as he leaves. Silas remains, shoving Sheppard towards a bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I don't suppose you want to tell me what's going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
Here's how we're gonna do this. I'm gonna ask you questions, and you're gonna give me answers. Is that simple enough for you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
Who are you, where are you from, and where'd you get your ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See, that's a funny coincidence, because I was going to ask you the same exact questions.</blockquote>
<p>[Silas punches Sheppard in the stomach. He falls to his knees.]
</p>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
The difference is, I'm not the one whose hands are tied behind his back. So again, who are you, where are you from, and where did you get your ship?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks trapped and still doesn't answer.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla, McKay and Ronon walk out of the Gate Room and through the corridors.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not entirely sure. It looks like Sheppard's jumper was attacked before it could reach the space gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
By who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the people on the planet aren't much past mud huts and blow darts, so I think we can assume they had nothing to do with it. What we do know that just before we lost contact, there was a short burst of radiation in the vicinity of the 'gate, consistent with the opening of a hyperspace window.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sheppard didn't seem to think so, and what little sensor data we've been able to pick up from the jumper seems to confirm it. The energy signature's all wrong. It's inconsistent with Ancient technology as well, which pretty much rules out the Replicators.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We know of no other peoples in this galaxy that possess hyperspace technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course not. No one reaches anywhere near that level of advancement without being culled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So then who was it?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HOLDING ROOM, TRAVELERS' SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Silas continues to punch Sheppard. His face is bloody from the abuse.]
</p>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
I could do this all day.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's mouth drips blood.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, your knuckles'll get sore eventually.</blockquote>
<p>[Before Silas can throw another punch. The door opens and an attractive woman enters with Nevik.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Has he said anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
Only his name. Reed Richards.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
His name is Sheppard. We intercepted part of his last radio transmission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't catch your name.</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin lifts his chin and studies the damage to his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
You can call me Larrin. You really should cooperate. It would be a shame to have to do too much damage.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I agree. Maybe if you guys tell me who you are and what you want, we could work out some kind of a deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Well, don't get my hopes up and then disappoint me.<br />
(to Silas)<br />
Tell him what happened to the last man that disappointed me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
We don't know. We never found his body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
We assumed you blew him out into space.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard cracks a pained smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I get it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Good. Bring him.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
Get up.</blockquote>
<p>[Silas and Nevik wrestle Sheppard to his feet and lead him out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;OFFICERS' MESS, TRAVELERS' SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Larrin and Sheppard are seated at a large dining table. Sheppard's hands are free. He is brought a tray full of unappetizing looking brown food. He looks at it in distaste.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Another form of torture?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
When you've spent as much time in space as we do, you don't get a lot of fresh food.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard picks up a gelatinous oblong shaped piece of food and dangles it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How much&#8230;time are we talking about?</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin tilts her head, but says nothing. Sheppard drops the food back onto the tray.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is a conversation, right? A two-way street?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
This <i>is</i> our home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
And others like it. We're travelers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You live in space all the time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
We land on planets when we need to&#8212;for supplies, trade. The rest of the time, we keep moving.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard studies a thick block of tan food.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
From the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
That may have been how it started, but now it's just who we are.</blockquote>
<p>[He drops the food.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, no offense, uh, Larrin, but it doesn't sound like much of a life.</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin stands and gets something to drink.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Being a herd animal isn't much of a life. Besides, the food has all the nutrients required.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, as tempting as that sounds&#8230;my jaw is a little sore right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Things like that are necessary from time to time. Although it's not the most efficient way of getting information, it does help people to understand&#8230;their situation.</blockquote>
<p>[She sets the drink down beside Sheppard, then leans against the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My situation being&#8230;completely at your mercy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Exactly. Anyway, I know more about you than you think.</blockquote>
<p>[She sits in the chair next to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Mm-hmm. For instance, I know you that you carry the gene required to operate Lantian technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(feigning ignorance)<br />
I've got the what?</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin rolls her eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Look, Sheppard, I know you have your secrets. And if you stay on my good side, I may even let you keep a few of them. However, if you continue to play ignorant with me, I really will jettison you out into space. For some time now, we've been hearing rumors about a new group of humans in the galaxy using the technology of the Ancestors to do battle with the Wraith. So, we set up a network of spy satellites around dozens of worlds with space gates, hoping for an encounter. Eventually we got lucky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And in the first meeting between our people, you attack me and disarm my ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Well, you were going through the 'gate, and I couldn't let that happen. You see, anyone capable of operating Lantian technology is of particular interest to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's why you took a sample of my blood.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a drink, then grimaces in distaste.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
We're working on a control interface adaptor that requires a small amount of necessary genetic material. We needed your blood to test it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going to guess it didn't go so well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Why would you say that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then you wouldn't have any use for me anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Don't underestimate yourself. There's all kinds of useful things you could do for me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is taken aback but intrigued.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
(over comm)<br />
Commander, we're approaching the coordinate.</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(into comm)<br />
Understood. Take us out of hyperspace.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Of course you're right. The interface isn't fully operational yet. Come with me.</blockquote>
<p>[A guard approaches to make sure Sheppard complies. Keeping a wary eye on the guard, Sheppard follows Larrin out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, TRAVELERS' SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Nevik, my chief science officer, insists that we have a much better chance of perfecting the interface if we reverse engineer it using Lantian technology that's already been initialized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't even know what "reverse engineering" is.</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin opens the door to the ship bay. The puddle jumper sits inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh. You want to use my ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Not exactly.</blockquote>
<p>[She nods to the guard. He shoves Sheppard inside. Larrin closes the door, locking Sheppard alone inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(to guard)<br />
Activate the force shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HANGAR BAY, TRAVELERS' SHIP</b>
</p><p>[A shield activates under Sheppard's feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Sheppard? Can you hear me?</blockquote>
<p>[The rest of the conversation switches between Sheppard and Larrin's positions.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mind telling me what you're doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Offering you a deal. Open the hangar bay doors.</blockquote>
<p>[The floor beneath Sheppard retracts. Only the shield he stands on protects him from the vacuum of space.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(holding back panic)<br />
This is just not right!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(nonchalantly)<br />
Don't worry. Your safe as long as the force shield doesn't malfunction, and&#8230;that almost never happens.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angry over his fear)<br />
Why are you doing this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
You wanted to know what this was all about? Look beneath you.</blockquote>
<p>[An <i>Aurora</i> class Ancient ship appears below his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
I'm assuming you recognize the technology. It's a Lantian battleship. It's been dormant for thousands of years, and you're going to help me get it operational again.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard watches the ship pass beneath him.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Both ships move slowly in formation.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Has it occurred to you people they might have abandoned this ship for a good reason in the first place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
We know the reason. We were able to access the ship's logs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
They were attacked by the Wraith. They lost communication, and their shields were failing. The engines were damaged as well but they managed to escape into hyperspace. Then they realized that their main drive was giving off deadly radiation. They were forced to abandon ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
They intended to return and affect repairs but never got the chance. The ship's been drifting in a two hundred year elliptical orbit around a nearby dwarf star ever since.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So it's never been fixed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hate to point out the obvious, but one of the reasons I agreed to help you was so that you wouldn't kill me. If I'm going to die of radiation anyway&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Don't worry. We've set up shield emitters to protect key areas of the ship, and we've all got radiation detectors.</blockquote>
<p>[She holds up her arm to show a device on her sleeve. Sheppard looks at the others, then looks at his own arm which notably has no detector.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Take him to the bridge. Start with sub-light propulsion. I'll go check the emitters.</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(calling after her)<br />
Don't think I could get one of those two, do you?</blockquote>
<p>[Silas shoves Sheppard to start moving the other direction.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Nevik points to the central chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, this ship is ten thousand years old. I'm just saying, for the record. If it doesn't work, it's not my fault.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
Just get on with it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits in the chair and touches the side controls. Panels all over the bridge come to life.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
Amazing. I've been trying for two months to activate these systems. I need to calibrate the interface for neural input. Why don't you start by moving the ship forward.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You sure about that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
That's why we're here. You fly the ship, and I record the inputs so I can replicate them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Silas unholsters his gun and points it at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
Enough. Fly the damn ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. I was just going to say, you said "start by moving the ship forward", when you should've said "start by initializing the inertial dampeners."</blockquote>
<p>[Nevik realizes his mistake as soon as Sheppard is speaking. He holds up his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEVIK<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<p>[His warning is too late. Sheppard activates the controls. He's thrown back into his chair, but remains in it. The two standing men are thrown across the room. In another part of the ship, Larrin too is thrown into a wall and drops to the deck.]
</p><p>[Sheppard stops the ship and gets out of the chair. He rushes over and grabs the gun from where it has fallen beside Silas. He points it at Silas, but the man is too stunned to react. Sheppard takes a closer look at the weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I have a friend who's got a gun just like this. I always wondered where he got it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard moves to one of the stations on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>SILAS<br />
I'm gonna kill you.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to sit up, but Sheppard fires, stunning both Silas and Nevik. Sheppard moves away from the station.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Larrin stands with a groan.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(into comm)<br />
Silas, what happened? Nevik, what's going on up there?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard grabs Silas's radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sorry, your people aren't available right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(into comm)<br />
Sheppard, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
You said fly the ship&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
&#8230;And I'm flying the ship.</blockquote>
<p>[He gets back in the chair and opens a hyperspace window.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Ancient ship shoots into hyperspace, leaving Larrin's ship behind.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Larrin is able to see through a window that the ship is now flying through hyperspace. She starts storming down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
We had a deal! I was prepared to let you go in exchange for your help.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BRIDGE, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry, I've never been able to trust anyone who kidnaps me, and tortures me, and threatens to blow me into space!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ALIEN PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies over the tree tops.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Lorne flies the ship. The rest of Sheppard's team is in the cockpit with him. Lorne and McKay study the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've got nothing. There's no wreckage, no transponder signal. If he was down there, we would've found him by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then where is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, he's not in orbit, and he's not on the planet, so the only logical assumption is that whoever attacked him must've brought him on board before they jumped into hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So what's the next step?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There is no next step! Look, we have no way of tracing him. He could be anywhere in the galaxy by now. I'm sorry, but sometimes there is just nothing we can do.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(over comm)<br />
Sheppard, I want you to drop this ship out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I don't think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Listen to me. I've shut off the shield emitters protecting your area of the ship. Right now, the bridge is being flooded with radiation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're bluffing. You'd never sacrifice your own people.</blockquote>
<p>[He pauses and listens to a blinking sound behind him. The spins the chair to look at the trussed Silas and Nevik. They are looking down at the radiation monitors, which are beeping.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Look, I don't want to kill you, but if you don't turn over the controls of this ship, I'll have no choice.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes a deep breath, then shuts down the hyperspace engine.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Ancient ship drops out of hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIG, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[A despondent Sheppard looks through the bars at Larrin.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
You surprise me, Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, as long as I didn't disappoint you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Oh no, I knew you'd make some sort of a move, I just wasn't expecting anything quite so&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Clever? Creative?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Reckless! You could've killed all of us, including yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[The step to the side where only a force field separates them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I once pulled eleven G's in an F-16 without passing out. I figured I had a shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Well, I underestimated you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

That is the sound of subspace. Now, it's mostly just random noise generated by various forms of radiation.

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Next, you're gonna give back what you took. Then, you're gonna leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Leave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You came in a dart, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
The bay was unguarded. We landed our darts and entered unchallenged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, then, you're gonna leave the same way you came. There's a space gate orbiting the second planet in the system. It may take you a while, but you'll get there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
If I restore her, there's nothing to stop you from going back on your word and killing me anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's true. I'd say there's a fifty-fifty chance I'll do it out of pure spite. But&#8230;if you don't, I will kill you.</blockquote>
<p>[He nudges the Wraith's head with the pistol. The Wraith "un-feeds", restoring Larrin to health and youth. She gasps in surprise. The Wraith appears subdued.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get up.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith slowly stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Turn around.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith turns around to the far passageway. Sheppard stands over Larrin while the Wraith walks away, pausing at the end of the corridor before going out of sight. Sheppard kneels by Larrin.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Uh, I don't know. That was so strange. To have your&#8230;whole life fading away, and then to&#8230;suddenly have it back again. It actually felt kind of good.</blockquote>
<p>[She smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quirking a smile)<br />
Mmm. I know. It happened to me once too. Long story. Think you can get up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[He helps her up. She half collapses as she gets to her feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Easy&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He continues to hold her up in an embrace. She clings to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
I'm okay. I'm all right. You saved my life. Again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If you hadn't come up with the plan, we'd both be dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
So are you saying we make a good team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, don't go crazy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Right. But in the interest of&#8230;interstellar relations, I think we should at least just&#8230;try to get along, right?</blockquote>
<p>[They kiss. Larrin pickpockets the Wraith stunner Sheppard confiscated and points it at his gut as they break apart.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've got to be kidding me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<p>[She shoots him with the stunner. He collapses to the floor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Larrin enters the room and goes immediately to the controls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard regains consciousness with a groan.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Larrin?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between Larrin's and Sheppard's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Sorry about this, Sheppard. And I really am grateful you saved my life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Well, you've got a funny way of showing it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Don't play hurt with me. It's easy to be generous when you think you have the upper hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
We both know the only reason you didn't stun me and lock me up the first opportunity you got was because you thought your ships were gonna get here first. You were wrong about that, by the way.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard grimaces.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Three Travelers' ships arrive out of hyperspace and flank the Ancient ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[A Traveler crewman appears on a video transmission appearing on a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TRAVELER CREWMAN<br />
Larrin, it's good to see you again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Believe me, I feel the same way. How did you find us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TRAVELER CREWMAN<br />
Well, we were monitoring communications before you jumped into hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
You knew he took the ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TRAVELER CREWMAN<br />
It&#8230;seemed fairly obvious. We guessed his priority would be to contact his people, so we sent probes to all the space gates in the vicinity of our previous position. Eventually, we detected your energy signature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Well done. Now, I want you to send over a couple of technicians to help me get the hyperdrive back online&#8230;Oh, and a security team as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TRAVELER CREWMAN<br />
Right away.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard shuffles to a door and tries to open it. He's locked out. He continues to try.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh come on!</blockquote>
<p>[The door suddenly opens. Three guards are on the other side, all aiming weapons at him. Sheppard bites his lip and raises his hands in surrender.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, close enough to do a full sensor sweep.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls up the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Looks like we've got four ships, one of them Lantian design, <i>Aurora</i>-class.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What about the other three?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't recognize the configurations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What about Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the logical assumption is that he's on board the ship that transmitted the signal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
And which one is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I have no idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We're about to enter weapons range, Doc. Which ships do I target?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps we should attempt to communicate before we attack. We know nothing about these people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
That's true. But right now about the only thing we've got going for us is the fact that we're cloaked. We send a signal, we give up our position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's right. They could target us, or-or for that matter, they could just jump back into hyperspace. We'd be right back at square one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We didn't come all this way for nothing, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(resigned)<br />
All right-all right, well, I'll see if I can find a way to disable them.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CELL, ANCIENT SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is locked in the cell again. Larrin enters, shutting off the shield barrier and entering the cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
I thought you'd be glad to know the hyperdrive repairs are almost complete.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, congratulations. You got what you want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Yes, it's true. I can fly the ship and navigate, but there are still dozens of systems I don't have access to. And if any of the controls went down, it would be a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(unsympathetically)<br />
So finish the adapter. You said you can reverse-engineer the systems that were already initialized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Well, yes we can, eventually&#8230;but it would go a lot faster if I keep you on board.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(furious)<br />
You are a piece of work, you know that?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Look, I know you don't agree with my tactics, but I wasn't lying about why I need this ship. I'm doing this for my people.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves the cell. Sheppard tries to follow, but the shield goes back up, trapping him inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look! I know you think you're helping your people, but you're wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[Larrin turns back.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've been running and hiding for thousands of years. You've survived, good for you. but now you're starting to see diminishing returns. One more ship, that'll buy a little more time. but ultimately, it's not going to change anything. Your people are headed for a slow death.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
What other choice do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In case you haven't heard, you will soon enough, but the Wraith are under attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
From who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's a long story but the point is, they're taking heavy damage, and if they don't get wiped out, they're gonna be vulnerable. Now, you people have hyperdrives and advanced weapons, and god knows what else. When the time is right, that kind of technology can tip the balance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
Are you suggesting an alliance?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I'm not asking you to dinner, but yeah, something like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
After all I put you through?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, like you said, you did it for your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LARRIN<br />
(smiling)<br />
I may have misjudged you after all.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
All right, Doc. We're in weapons range. Whaddya got for me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can target the Lantian ship's engines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What about the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I've been going over the sensor data, but there's still too many unknowns. I mean, if you hit 'em in the wrong spot we could blow them out of the sky or the-or the drones could just bounce harmlessly off the shields. There's no way to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
All right, well it's still our best option. We can't risk them getting away.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The four ships open hyperspace windows and disappear into them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(devastated)<br />
They're&#8230;gone.</blockquote>
<p>[The team looks crushed. A alarm beeps. McKay looks down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm getting a contact. Huh. It's a jumper. One life sign.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into comm)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne. Is that you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over comm)<br />
That's affirmative, Major.</blockquote>
<p>[The team all breath sighs of relief.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(continuing into comm)<br />
&#8230;It's good to hear from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Likewise, sir. Seemed like we came pretty close to losing you there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with rueful chuckle)<br />
You don't know the half of it.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team eats a meal together. Sheppard appears to savor every bite.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm. That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You spend enough time with a bunch of space nomads, you really begin to appreciate what you have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, it's difficult to imagine spending one's entire life onboard a ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If it was me, I'd go crazy.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shoots him a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They weren't exactly the most even-keeled people. I'm still not exactly sure why they let me go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, you did offer them an alliance. That has to be worth something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Or they figured out you'd be more trouble than you're worth.</blockquote>
<p>[He picks up his slab of meat with his fork and takes a bite out of it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(pointing his knife in emphasis)<br />
Now that is a possibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, there's something you're not telling us&#8230;She was hot, wasn't she?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard studiously works at cutting his meat, not looking up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know what you're talking about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, I knew it! That is so typical!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon smiles at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She had me beaten, Rodney. She threatened to kill me several times! It wasn't like we were hanging out in the spa together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(still fuming)<br />
Whatever, all I know is that every time I get taken captive, it's the Wraith. Just once I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you may still get a chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, what do you mean?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes another bite of meat.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's still out there.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay considers this. Teyla rolls her eyes. Sheppard's expression goes from joking to contemplative, and he shakes his head to clear his thoughts before continuing with his meal.]
