<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and several other scientists sit at their laptops. McKay stands before a whiteboard covered with writing, studying a formula.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Maybe if we&#8230;um&#8230;No&#8230; Nope. Huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE SCIENTIST<br />
Why don't we bring the Wraith in on this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE SCIENTIST<br />
A lot of this new nanite coding is based on his calculations, so maybe&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A) He wouldn't help us. B) We don't need his help. And C) Somebody get me a coffee.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE SCIENTIST<br />
You've been silently staring at that board for three hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, it'll come to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(frustrated)<br />
Just e-mail her already.</blockquote>
<p>[The other scientists shift uncomfortably as they continue to watch with interest. McKay turns around slowly to face Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Rodney, we're stuck. We've been stuck for ten hours. Just ask her for help. Please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not stuck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The last time we had a block like this, she helped us through it, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That was for something completely different!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I cannot sit here waiting for you to have an epiphany! I'm losing the will to live!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(thinking)<br />
I suppose there could be more important things I should be working on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(talking quickly)<br />
However you want to sell it to yourself, that's fine.</blockquote>
<p>[He slaps his laptop shut and leaves. Everyone else quickly follows suit. McKay is soon the only one in the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>EXT&#8212;MILLER HOME, VANCOUVER, B.C. CANADA, EARTH, DAY
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KITCHEN, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[The Miller family of Kaleb Miller, his wife Jeanie, and their daughter Madison are all in the kitchen. Madison is pushing a large slab of cookie dough onto a baking sheet.]
</p>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Dad, done!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Just one big cookie?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Yep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Don't you want to use your cutters?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Nah, I just want a big one.</blockquote>
<p>[The parents laugh. The laptop on the counter chimes.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[She goes to check the computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
You may want to flatten the dough a little bit.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to help her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
No? Just a giant cookie mountain, that's what you're going for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Okay.<br />
(to Jeanie)<br />
Anything good?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
It's from my brother. He's stuck again. Do you mind if I&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(waving her to stay with the laptop)<br />
Yeah, I got this.<br />
(to Madison)<br />
Here, you want to help with mine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
I need a lot of flour.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeanie grabs a notepad and starts writing calculations as Miller works with Madison.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Oh. How 'bout some more chocolate chips?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
But not the whole bowl.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
No, that-that would be too many.</blockquote>
<p>EXT&#8212;MILLER HOME, VANCOUVER, B.C., CANADA, EARTH, NIGHT
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MASTER BEDROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Jeanie rolls over in bed and opens her eyes to see Miller lying awake, looking concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You can't sleep?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
I thought I heard something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Madison?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
I don't know. I'm going to check it out.</blockquote>
<p>[He gets out of bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
She probably just snuck downstairs for more cookies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(chuckling)<br />
That's actually not a bad idea.</blockquote>
<p>[Before he gets to the bedroom door, it bursts open. Two men dressed all in black and wearing ski masks and goggles enter. They are heavily armed with laser sights on their weapons. Miller is forced to the floor. Jeanie whimpers and cowers in the bed as one of them aims his gun at her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>ASSAILANT<br />
You're coming with us.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[NID Agent Barrett waits at the bottom of the Gate ramp as McKay, Sheppard, and Ronon arrive through the active wormhole. McKay is wearing civilian clothing, while Sheppard and Ronon are dressed as usual. McKay is carrying a backpack.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
Gentlemen. I'm Agent Barrett. I work with the NID. Mr. Woolsey has asked me to help you any way that I can. I'm sorry that we couldn't meet under better circumstances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Have the kidnappers tried to make contact with us yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
No, I'm afraid not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, well I need to get to Vancouver.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
Okay, the <i>Daedalus</i> is in orbit, so it will be a quick trip.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads them out of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have you learned any new information yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
No, not yet. The NID is liaising with CSIS on the ground. They are expecting us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
C-what, now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Canadian Security Intelligence Services. They're&#8230;kinda like our CIA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"CSIS." That's the best you guys can do, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Barrett leads them all into the elevator, noting their outfits. McKay is in civilian garb, but Sheppard has on his black BDUs, and Ronon is wearing his usual leather outfit.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
We will be out in the open, so&#8230;perhaps a change of clothes first?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks down at himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>EXT&#8212;SUBURBAN STREET, VANCOUVER, B.C, CANADA, DAY
</p><p>[A sedan parks on the street. Several law enforcement vehicles and personnel are around. McKay, Sheppard, Barrett, and Ronon get out. Sheppard wears black slacks and a jacket with a white button down shirt. Ronon is dressed identically, except he wears jeans.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I look dumb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It helps you blend in a little.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm gonna stand out no matter what you dress me in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a good point.</blockquote>
<p>[As they enter the Miller home, one of the bystanders watching the activity takes a keen interest in the newcomers and starts dialing his cell phone.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Forensic specialists and other law enforcement are scattered throughout the home. Miller sits on his couch, next to Madison. He sees McKay and the others enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Hey, look. It's your Uncle Mer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, lady.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
You going to say hi?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Where's Mom?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;I&#8230;she&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
I told you she-she's had to go away for a bit, but she's going to come back soon, okay?<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Can I, uh&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures to speak privately.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(to Madison)<br />
Okay, Sweetie.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins Madison. McKay and Miller move into the kitchen.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KITCHEN, MILLER HOME</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Who did this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're not sure, but we have the best people in the world working on this and all the resources of&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(upset)<br />
You know, when y-you came back here last year, she almost didn't go back with you to Atlantis. I-I said, "Go. You have to do it. You'll regret not going."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
She knew it was going to be dangerous, but you two are so competitive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Listen to me. We're gonna&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
This is your fault, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, just a second.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
She got kidnapped because of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, we do not know that for sure!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
We don't? Really? You-you figure four masked men with guns broke in her to steal her secret apple dumpling recipe? A jealous neighbor, maybe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you're angry. You have every right to be&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(half to himself)<br />
If something happens to her&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Kaleb? We're gonna find her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KALEB<br />
(pleading)<br />
Just&#8230;bring her back. Bring-bring her home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I will.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LIVING ROOM, MILLER HOME</b>
</p><p>[Miller reenters and moves to where Sheppard has been entertaining Madison.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Come on, Mad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MADISON<br />
Where we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Just away for a bit.</blockquote>
<p>[He picks her up, and they leave. McKay rejoins Barrett, Sheppard, and Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I told him to get a hotel. There's no reason for them to stick around here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
All right, thanks, guys. Give us the room, please.</blockquote>
<p>[The remaining law enforcement officials pack up and leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
So, where do you want to start?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jeanie and I were corresponding by e-mail. Um, she was, uh&#8230;I was bouncing some ideas off her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
What about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, before Sheppard's Wraith showed up, I was trying to perfect my nanite medical program.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks surprised.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That thing you used to save Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, a better, more complex version of that, but yeah. Of course, as soon as we found out that the Replicators were attacking human worlds throughout the galaxy, we obviously switched our focus to shutting them down once and for all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
And you sent Jeanie the program that you were working on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. I just-I needed a new set of eyes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The question is, what does it have to do with her being taken?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Well, maybe the Trust or some other Earth-based organization wanted info on me or about the Program. But regardless, my e-mail and her capture happened too close together not to be connected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
Right. That sounds like a good place to start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Has anyone touched her computer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
No. No, I-I told them that you wanted to take a look at it first. Nobody's touched it.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits by her laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm gonna need to take it apart. This is going to take some time. Why don't you go back to the hotel? I'll call you if I find anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's okay. We'll stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously. This could take ten to twelve hours. I'm just-there's nothing you can do here. Just go back to the hotel. I'll call you if I find anything.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard exchange looks but back off, leaving McKay working on the laptop.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COMPUTER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Two men dressed in black combat gear bring Jeanie into the room. Her hands are tied in front of her and a black bag is over her head. One guard leads her to a chair and sits her down. He takes off the bad and they leave. Jeanie is disoriented, but gets up and heads over to the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<p>[She spins to see Wallace. She hadn't noticed him before. He walks over, holding a knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
No. Wait! Please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Shh. It's all right. Let me?</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures, and Jeanie holds still. He cuts her hands free. She instantly backs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
My name is Henry Wallace. I'm sorry to have&#8230;I need you to do some work for me.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VANCOUVER MOTEL, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOTEL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard sit in the room. A cell phone rings. Sheppard gets up to answer it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into phone)<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BARRETT'S CAR</b>
</p><p>[Barrett drives, while McKay sits in the passenger seat, talking on the phone.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into phone)<br />
So, someone <i>was</i> monitoring my sister's computer. I think I've cracked their Trojan. And I've got an address. Barrett and I are on our way there now.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation takes place switching between the two locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you said it was going to take ten hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, even I underestimate how smart I am sometimes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, stay at the house, and-and we'll all go together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's too late, we're almost there. I'll give you an address. You can meet us.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sighs and grabs a notepad.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Barrett walk to a building.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This looks like the place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
Shouldn't we wait for Sheppard and Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay makes a dismissive gesture.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, stand back.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay moves to kick open the door. As he does, Barrett tries the knob. It's unlocked, and he opens the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, well that works, too.</blockquote>
<p>[Barrett unholsters his pistol. McKay doesn't wait and charges in. He glances back at Barrett.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You wouldn't happen to have another one of those on you, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
Yeah, I got a shotgun in the car.</blockquote>
<p>[Barrett backs up, but gets surprised by a gunman, dressed like the ones who raided the Miller home. He's knocked down, and another gunman aims his rifle at a surprised McKay.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Ronon's SUV drives through the streets. They arrive at the address to find Barrett lying on the street, his head bleeding. There is no sign of McKay or anyone else.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay? What the hell happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
(wincing in pain)<br />
Two men. They must have been following us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARRETT<br />
He's not here. They took him.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;COMPUTER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The armed men lead McKay into the room. His hands are tied behind his back and the bag is over his head. Jeanie stands when she sees him. They take off the bag and release his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Meredith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jeanie! Thank god you're alive!</blockquote>
<p>[As the men leave them, McKay moves to his sister and they embrace.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I came back to Earth as soon as I heard you'd were kidnapped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Have you seen Madison and Kaleb?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. They're, uh, they're a little shaken, but they're okay. I put a security detail on them, so you don't have to worry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Then, how did you&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I got ambushed trying to track down the guys who took you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(rolling her eyes)<br />
Oh, great. That's just great. First you get me captured, then you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you captured?! How do you figure that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh, come on! They were monitoring my computer, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
So would I be here if you hadn't sent me those e-mails?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Possibly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Meredith!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted by the room)<br />
What is this, a lab?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Wow, that's great detective work there, Nancy Drew.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where the hell are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I have no idea. They-they put me on a plane&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts playing with the computers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, me too. Any idea who's behind any of this?</blockquote>
<p>[Wallace enters with some guards.]
</p>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Doctor McKay. I've heard a lot about you. It's a pleasure.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts out his hand to shake. McKay backs up and says nothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
I thought you might show up if your sister&#8230;went missing. We couldn't count on it, of course, but it's a pretty big bonus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Bonus? Look, I have no idea who you are, but you have made a terrible mistake bringing me here. Now, I suggest you let us both go right now, otherwise about a hundred marines are going to come kicking down your front door in the next two minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
I'm pretty sure they won't, actually. Your subcutaneous transmitter has been deactivated.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's face falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
I should've started with that. My name is Henry Wallace. I'm the president of&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
DMT. Great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
You know who I am, then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(tightly)<br />
I'm familiar with your work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
What's DMT?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's Devlin Medical Technologies. They're a predominantly government-funded contractor. And unfortunately for us, they manufacture our subcutaneous transmitters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh, great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. How do you even know I exist? Your company is only privy to very basic information about newly declassified experiments the military's working on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
No, more accurately, my company is given limited access to alien advances discovered through the Stargate program, and is asked to integrate them into Earth-based technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
You're not cleared to know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
No, I'm not. But after years of being&#8230;stupefied by the military's endless and unbelievable advances, I started to do a little digging. That's how I found out about the SGC, Atlantis, you&#8230;and that's why we've been monitoring your family's e-mails for quite some time now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you want from me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
I've hit a wall and need some help.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MEDICAL WING</b>
</p><p>[Wallace leads McKay and Jeanie to stand outside a patient room. A doctor monitors a teenage girl, lying on the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
My daughter. Sharon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's wrong with her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
She's suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm very sorry, but, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
She's been particularly unresponsive to induction chemotherapy, Prednisone, Vincristine, cranial irradiation&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't even know what all that means. How am I supposed to help?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Look, the best doctors in the world have told her to start saying her good-byes. Begin making funeral plans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's what I'm saying. Neither of us are doctors. Look, yes, I have a PhD&#8212;two actually&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
The latest project my company has been working on for the SGC involves applying advances in nanotechnology to cure injury and disease. We were close to a prototype.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(realizing)<br />
Wait a second. Wait&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
Sharon was injected with the first batch of nanites one week ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You've barely got manufacturing perfected. I'm working on the coding. It-it's months away! They're not ready!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
My team thought they'd ironed out most of the coding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Ironed out?" It's not that easy!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
I know that&#8230;now. They're malfunctioning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

<p>[The Wraith Todd arrives with two guards. He is restrained. He staggers down the ramp, breathing hard and looking around with interest.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Why have you brought me here?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LEVEL EIGHTEEN LAB</b>
</p><p>[Two guards wait outside the lab while McKay, the Wraith, and other guards stand inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, you understand the Replicator coding better than anyone. If we're going to do this quickly, then&#8230;we need your help.<br />
(struck with the sudden reversed position)<br />
And why should you care? I mean, we're going to kill you either way, right? That's what you're thinking? Okay, okay, um, so&#8230;incentives. Uh, first off, we have no interest in killing you. Of course, you've probably already figured that out by now. But we can't let you go either because you know too much about Atlantis, unless you could prove that you were trustworthy. And&#8230;this would go a long way towards proving that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't buy that either. Heh. Do you have any relatives? Do the Wraith have brothers or sisters? I-I don't know how it works. But with us, with&#8230;my people? Those bonds mean a lot. My sister's in trouble, and it's pretty much all my fault. You could help us. You-you could save her.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith yawns.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Doesn't mean anything to you, does it? I suppose it wouldn't mean much to me either if I was in your place. Okay, okay, you and I both know that if we can figure out how to shut down these Earth-made nanites, it would be a giant step towards shutting down the Replicators. I know you lost your hive. I have no idea how horrible that must have been for you.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith growls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But knowing that they're still out there? That-that you alone could do something about it? That's gotta be driving you crazy. So don't do this for me. Don't-don't do this for my sister. Do this for yourself. Do this because you know you can, and because you know it'll help destroy the Replicators once and for all. Whaddya say?</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith grunts and nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>'<i>MONTAGE</i>
</p><p>[The SFs release the Wraith's restraints.]
</p><p>[McKay and the Wraith talk as the Replicator code scrolls past on a monitor.]
</p><p>[Jeanie lies in a coma in the infirmary.]
</p><p>[McKay and the Wraith each work at computers.]
</p><p><b>END MONTAGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All, right, there's a few bugs to code out, but I think we're close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
We?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I have been contributing. Now if I could suggest a few, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith stumbles to his knees.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith collapses onto the floor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC VIP ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard are alone in the spare conference room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What if he's faking? Maybe he's just milking it for a hot meal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I believe him. He can't finish the coding without feeding. I understand exactly what he's doing, but he's far more versed in implementing it than I am. Maybe if I had a couple of weeks, but he's the only one who can do it in a day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know what to say, but the NID is not going to provide us with a human for him to feed on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know. It needs to be me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scared, but determined)<br />
I want him to feed on me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps closer to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You want to what?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let him feed off of me. Get his strength back, then he can finish the coding and save Jeanie.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then what? Force him to give you your life back?! He's not going to do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sharon died. Half an hour ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
I don't understand. What happened?! I-I thought the nanites would&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This time, it wasn't a problem with the programming, it was a manufacturing defect. Look, in layman's terms, the nanites ran out of steam while they were repairing her arteries. She bled out internally. There was nothing we could do. I can't lose my sister, John. How am I going to explain that to her husband? To-to her kid?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That Wraith'll kill you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's my choice to make.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, it's not. You're an invaluable of my team, and you report directly to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really? You want to talk about chain-of-command right now?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's eyes are wet with tears.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(intensely)<br />
You are not doing this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's here because of me! I can't fix the problem, but I can help the guy who can. Look, this was not an easy decision to make.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(begging)<br />
Please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC HOLDING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Wallace and Sheppard sit across a table from each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're going over the data. We don't understand what happened. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
And Jeanie?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's not going to make it. We brought in a, uh&#8230;specialist from the Pegasus Galaxy. Part of an enemy race called the Wraith. Somehow, McKay has convinced him to, uh, create a program to shut down the nanites in Jeanie's body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
And?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He was close, real close. But, uh, he hasn't fed in a few weeks, so he collapsed. He's too weak to finish the coding modifications.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
(upset)<br />
I don't understand. If it means saving her life, why not just feed him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, he feeds on&#8230;humans. Their life force.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
(nodding, thinking)<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Little hard to find volunteers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
So Jeanie will&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's gonna die. Just like Sharon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
(with remorse)<br />
I'm so sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sure you are.</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out some photographs. He tosses them down one-by-one on the table. Wallace picks them up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is, um, Kaleb, her husband. And, uh, Madison, her little daughter.</blockquote>
<p>[Wallace weeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>WALLACE<br />
I never meant for any of this to happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know you didn't. But it did. Now McKay's blaming himself, and I know better&#8230; You know better.</blockquote>
<p>[Wallace takes a deep breath.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LEVEL EIGHTEEN CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay heads to the door to the isolation lab and runs a key card through. It rejects it. He tries again with the same result.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, come on.</blockquote>
<p>[An SF comes over.]
</p>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Can I help you, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um, no. No problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
May I see that, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;.no you may not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Sir. The card please.</blockquote>
<p>[A resigned McKay hands it over. The guard looks at it.]
</p>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
You're not Doctor Lee, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, is that Lee's card? You know, we were just at the gym and, uh, must've swapped pants. So, uh, would you just open the door for me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
Not without a card, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm Doctor Rodney McKay. This is my lab. Would you please open the door?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
I can't do that, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(fiercely)<br />
This is a matter of life and death! Open the door!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD<br />
I'm under&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The door slides open from the inside. The Wraith is standing and working. Sheppard is beside him. There are medical personnel and guards there.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let him in.</blockquote>
<p>[The guard lets McKay pass.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LEVEL EIGHTEEN ISOLATION LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters and sees the orderlies wheel out a body bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was showing Wallace the labs. The Wraith got the upper hand. That's what the report's going to say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard watches them wheel out Wallace's body with an inscrutable expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Come on, you've got work to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
No, he does not. I've completed the reprogramming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was quick. Well, get it uploaded.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks around in wonder, then joins the Wraith in working.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Jeanie wakes up. McKay sits by her bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jeanie?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
(confused)<br />
Mer&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's okay. It's okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Man&#8230;.medical comas are weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, you're not the first to mention it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Did you&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
So I-I'm&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You are absolutely fine. I mean, aside from a few inert nanites in you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Thanks, Mer.</blockquote>
<p>[She sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can&#8230;I'm really sorry about all this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Oh, I am going to hold this over your head for&#8230;forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. Totally fair.</blockquote>
<p>[She swings her legs over the bed to stand. McKay assists her.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Like, you're going to eat a lot of vegetarian food. Heh, heh. And not complain about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sure, sure.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts her slippers on the floor for her to step into.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
And you're going to read Madison three stories instead of her usual two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You're going to buy me a car.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches for a robe for her then stops short.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, let's not get out of control, here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
You almost got me killed. That's at least a car, a nice one&#8212;a hybrid!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, we'll talk about it on the way home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
Home. That sounds great.</blockquote>
<p>[She reaches forward and hugs him.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANIE<br />
I love you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[They break apart and Jeanie glares at him expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shrugging)<br />
I love you too.</blockquote>
<p>[She chuckles as he hands her the robe.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard lounges on his bed reading a comic book as McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look who's back. How was the family?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, it was great. Bought 'em a Prius.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Guilt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Listen&#8230;I can't believe what you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't really want to talk about it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard keeps reading the comic book to emphasize the point.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You talked Wallace into sacrificing himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(carefully)<br />
No, I didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, then how did he&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard closes the comic book.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I presented a situation. He volunteered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Still, you talked a man into killing himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He wanted to make things right. I merely, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Presented the situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods, his expression vulnerable. McKay stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Want to get something to eat?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard studies McKay, then tosses his comic aside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk out of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Say&#8230;you and I are about even when it comes to looks, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who's been lying to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I'm serious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I am, too. Who's been lying to you?</blockquote>
