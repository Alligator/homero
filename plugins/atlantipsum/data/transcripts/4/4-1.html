</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Keller and a medical team rush Weir to the infirmary. The unconscious Weir is strapped down with a neck brace and is receiving oxygen.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(into radio)<br />
She's unresponsive, and her pupils are sluggish. I need you to prep the O.R. and have the scanner ready when we get there.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Marie is in scrubs and has a sterile environment waiting. The scanner is being wheeled in.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're on it. The scanner is moving into position.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[One of the monitors starts beeping.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEDIC<br />
She's crashing.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller climbs onto the gurney and begins CPR.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Let's go, guys! I don't want to do this in the hall!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[A monitor resets and starts streaming information. An encouraged McKay heads back to a station with his computer. His face is covered with small abrasions from the breaking glass. Sheppard and Teyla are nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here we go, here we go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You got city-wide sensors back online?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hopefully, yeah. Slowly booting up right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can we contact the <i>Apollo</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not yet, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because subspace communications are down. Don't worry, I got Chuck working on it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay nods to Chuck, who's working on some computer towers. Something short circuits, and he's showered in sparks. McKay rolls his eyes and continues working.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe you should be working on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've got bigger fish to fry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What could be more important than contacting the <i>Apollo</i>?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's eyes widen as he studies something on his computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This can't be right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay heads to another station.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Power. We're losing massive amounts of power!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon sits on one of the infirmary beds. A large shard of glass is imbedded in his right shoulder. A doctor is examining him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Just pull it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
I can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
We have to wait to get you under the scanner, make sure pulling it out's not going to cause even more damage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(seething)<br />
Pull&#8230;it&#8230;out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
Yeah, yeah, I get it. You're a tough guy. If you want to pull it out, go ahead, but I'm not going to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon reaches to pull out the shard.]
</p>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
(panicked)<br />
Are you crazy?!</blockquote>
<p>[At this moment Keller's team wheels Weir in. Ronon pushes the doctor treating him aside to see what's happening. They move Weir into the operating room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEDIC<br />
On three, ready? One, two, three.</blockquote>
<p>[They transfer Weir from the gurney to the operating table. Keller prepares defibrillator paddles.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Clear.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone moves back, and she shocks Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Charging&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ZPM ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and others move frantically around.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(into radio)<br />
I don't think the problem is on this end.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
I don't care where the problem is&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[A technician hands Zelenka a tablet computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing over radio)<br />
I want to know what the problem is.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka's face falls as he studies the new information.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's in the conduits.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Oh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over radio)<br />
It looks like&#8230;several of the main conduits were affected by the brush with the beam.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right, that means we'll need to uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts frantically moving from one area of the control room to another.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, yes, yes. You-you should get the&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I will as soon as I've shut down all the&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, yes, yes. I will do the same thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wait, wait, wait. What's going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Every second I waste, we're draining more power. Just trust me, we're doing the right thing here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
No change.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Let's start her on Manitol. Two hundred cc's i.v.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tell me what's going on, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Long story short, there are a bunch of systems on right now that don't need to be, and given our current situation, they are draining the life out of the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can you not just shut them off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, just wait, uh&#8230;maybe. Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to another station and frantically types on the laptop.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller frantically works to save Weir's life.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, come on.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
She's been flat for almost two minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller grits her teeth and shakes her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come, we need you here, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<p>[A monitor starts beeping rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
She's going back into V-fib. Let's hit her again!</blockquote>
<p>[She grabs the paddles.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Clear.</blockquote>
<p>[She shocks Weir again. After a moment, the heart rate monitor beeps at a steady rhythm.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
There we go. Here we go, let's start the scan.</blockquote>
<p>[The team starts working the scanner. Marie moves over to check the monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Doctor Keller?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller joins Marie in looking at the brain scan.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That's not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Her brain is swelling quite seriously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That would explain the sluggish pupils.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Yeah, among other things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Give her Nimodipine, thirty milligrams Q four H, and keep an eye on her blood pressure.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nothing. Well, the control grid's all out of whack. I can't shut the systems down from here. We're&#8230;bleeding out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We can shut down the systems manually, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
I don't think we have the time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You would rather not try?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you're right. You're right.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Uh, Zelenka, we need to deploy some teams.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller and Marie monitor Weir's progress using the scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
She's not responding. We're losing her.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sending some of my men with your guys in case they need help. Their ETA's under five minutes. Does that give us enough time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. What little power we had night is almost gone. We'll be lucky if we can make it through the night.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The city-ship of Atlantis flies through space, the shield surrounding the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay stand alone at the edge of the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to McKay)<br />
Listen&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've been making a lot of decisions here without consulting me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm sorry. We're a little under the gun here. Things move fast!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I understand that, but with Elizabeth&#8230;incapacitated, I hate to say it, but, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(contrite)<br />
You're in charge. I know. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just keep me in the loop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Okay, well, I'll give you the, uh, <i>Cole's Notes</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, the <i>Cliff's Notes</i>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why didn't you just say that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;never mind. Look, as we were leaving Lantia, we got grazed by the, uh, Replicators' satellite beam, right? It impacted the side of the tower, and from what we can tell, it wreaked havoc on a number of power conduits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, re-route the power then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah&#8230;it's not so easy. Look, the ZPM room's at the base of the tower, which means that the conduits in and around where the beam hit are primary conduits. They can't be&#8230;uh, routed around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So parts of the city don't have power?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. The-the conduits weren't severed, they were damaged. Look, it's complicated but&#8230;um, imagine them as, uh, leaky pipes, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, you pump water through them, they leak, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatient)<br />
You dumb this down any more, and you're going to get hit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sorry. Look, the city realizes that, for whatever reason, power's not making it to the outer piers. So, instead of repairing the leaks, which it can't do, it increases the ZPM's output so that even though the pipes are leaky and we lose power, enough energy makes it to the end of the line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And that's bad?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, that's good. Well, otherwise we'd lose the shields, we'd lose atmosphere, we'd-we'd all be dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(confused)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, there are a number of systems on right now that don't need to be, and they're screaming for power. Look, we're gonna lose juice, potentially a fatal amount no matter what we do. But, uh, if we can get those nonessential systems shut down, then the ZPM will need to pump less power through the leaky pipes and&#8230;we'll be able to put off imminent death for another&#8230;hour or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm. So, then, where are we at?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, well, the teams are making good time. Uh, we've got about sixty percent of the nonessential systems shut down, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[An alert wails from nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(surprised)<br />
The city's outer buildings are decompressing, shutting down the artificial gravity.</blockquote>
<p>[A monitor shows parts of the shield intersecting with the outer tips of the city structures.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why would the city do such a thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's gonna collapse the shield. It's trying to save power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(urgently)<br />
We've got guys out there.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Matthews, fall back to the tower immediately.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OUTER PIER CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Matthews is with two technicians working on a control panel in the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MATTHEWS<br />
I don't think we're done, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
The city shield's collapsing. Move!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OUTER PIER CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MATTHEWS<br />
You heard the man. Go! Go!</blockquote>
<p>[The trio run towards the tower.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The city schematic shows the decompression sequence as well as the three life signs of Matthews's team heading through the corridors ahead of it.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(somber)<br />
They're not going to make it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
S-stop it. Stop it from doing this.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay works some controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The city doesn't think we can maintain the shields unless we make it smaller. If we delay its collapse, it could fail completely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't care! Override it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not letting me.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OUTER PIER</b>
</p><p>[Doors seal closed section by section just as the shield collapses through it.]
</p><p>[Matthews and his team head down a stairwell.]
</p>
<blockquote>MATTHEWS<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're almost there.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're going to lose those guys, McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You think I don't realize that?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MATTHEWS<br />
(over radio)<br />
The gravity just shut down!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OUTER PIER CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Matthews's team float above the floor as the shield moves past them, collapsing inward.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everyone watches as one by one, the life signs of the three men disappear. No one speaks for several moments.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(somberly)<br />
Tell the other teams to hurry. I don't want them out there any longer than they need to be.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE, MIDWAY STATION</b>
</p><p>[The Midway Station of the McKay-Carter Intergalactic Bridge has now finished its construction. It floats between the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies. Neither Stargate is visible as the station is now thoroughly enclosed in metal.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION</b>
</p><p>[Carter floats inside above the Milky Way Stargate. She holds a tablet computer and pushes herself along to the control section where Lee is.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hey, are you getting the same data rate inconsistencies off these flash drives? Bill? Bill?</blockquote>
<p>[She turns to Lee just to see him vomit into a motion sickness bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh, sorry. Oh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh boy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
It's this damn weightlessness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You know, maybe you should 'gate back to Earth. I can get somebody else to help me bring the station online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
No, no, I-I'll be fine as soon as I can&#8230;figure out how to get the gravity back on. Uh, what were you saying about the flash drives?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Yeah, it's just that every time I update this software, the drives&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The sound of chevrons locking can be heard. Carter checks the monitors.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The Pegasus 'gate just activated.</blockquote>
<p>[Lee floats over.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over comm)<br />
This is Colonel Abe Ellis, commander of the <i>Apollo</i>. Midway Station, please respond.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Ellis, this is Colonel Samantha Carter. I am on the Midway Station. How did the mission go?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, as far as we can tell, Atlantis successfully evaded the Replicators' beam and was able to enter hyperspace.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MIDWAY STATION</b>
</p><p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches from the Midway Station and the </i>Apollo<i>.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
From what you can tell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Well, they're not at the predetermined rendezvous point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(confused)<br />
Really? They should have beaten you there. Actually, hey, how are you dialing us? M12-578 doesn't have a 'gate. It's off the grid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
I jumped to the nearest 'gate to see if they've checked in with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, I'm sorry to say that they haven't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
That's probably not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No. Probably not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
I'll head back, dial you again in an hour, sooner if I hear from them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Sounds good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
<i>Apollo</i> out.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Atlantis floats in space. The shield no longer extends to the outer piers.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon walks around the infirmary, wheeling his i.v. pole. He goes to where the doctor who treated him and another are monitoring Weir's surgery.]
</p>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
Hey. You should be in bed.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon merely looks at the doctor, then his attention goes to the monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How's she doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOCTOR<br />
Her brain&#8230;is&#8230;swelling. Drastically. More than her head can handle. If it doesn't stop, they're going to have to perform a decompressive craniectomy. Basically, they, um, cut out a piece of her skull, and the brain is allowed to expand&#8230;outside of her head.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[McKay heads to Weir's office, where Sheppard stands, staring at her desk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Any word on how she's doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's still in the O.R. No real news yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. Listen, I think we should collapse the shield right to the tower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That will leave us completely exposed to space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, it will. But our power is spread so thin right now, I don't have any extra juice to come up with the solutions to the hundred or so problems that could lead to our premature demise today.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay start walking the catwalk to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, check with Zelenka. Make sure all the science teams are accounted for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Already done. We're ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Do what you need to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to control room staff)<br />
Okay. Here we go.</blockquote>

Thirty-five.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller closes her eyes and sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I can't let her get to forty. Okay&#8230;Let's prep for a decompressive craniectomy.</blockquote>
<p>[The surgical staff preps for the neurosurgery, shaving Weir's head and setting clamps around her skull. Keller performs the delicate surgery. A monitor beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Pressure down to twenty-nine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELER<br />
Hopefully, we'll get it under twenty-five.</blockquote>
<p>[She continues the surgery.]

Does that mean we can use the 'gate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sadly, no. To activate the 'gate would require that we stay within a fairly small area of space. We're moving too fast to use it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can we use the sub-lights to slow down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it would be great if they were working, but sub-light and navigation are out.</blockquote>

You decided to put this in the "good news" category?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, at least we're not lost anymore, right? Number two, there is nothing wrong with our hyperdrives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then why did we fall out of hyperspace prematurely?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The damaged power conduits. We had plenty of gas in the tank, so to speak, we just couldn't get it to the engine. Stalled out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So if we repair the conduits, can we jump back into hyperspace?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's they idea, yes. I mean, we wouldn't be able to repair them completely&#8230;not without, you know, landing and shutting down, and such, but, uh, we can definitely patch them up. Look, Zelenka and his team are working as fast as they possibly can, but the problem is we're still leaking a lot of power.</blockquote>

Even with all our reductions?</blockquote>

I'm afraid so, yes.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, this is the minimum amount of power the city requires to execute a jump into hyperspace. If we don't fix the power conduits inside of an hour, we'll drop below that level. After that, we're stuck. We'll have maybe thirty hours before the shields fail, and we'll all die in the vacuum of space.</blockquote>

<p>[Sheppard throws Zelenka. The force on the tether pulls Sheppard with Zelenka and they float across the open space, arriving at the other side. Zelenka slaps into the wall on the other side. He turns, breathing heavily in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
That was&#8230;it was unbelievable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get to work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka snatches the repair case from where it started to float away.]

</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How's it going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Slowly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Have you found a way to reactivate the nanites safely?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, short story, yes. Long story, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm a hundred percent certain that I can reactivate the nanites and have them help put Elizabeth back together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Problem is, that they would do it by replacing her damaged cells with replicated nanites. Which means the moment I tell them to turn inert again&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Those cells would stop functioning, and she'd die.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Well, the good news is, I've been able to program them in such a way that they would never harm her, I-I'm sure of that. Plus I've shut down their ability to contact the Replicators via subspace, so both she and we would be safe. But, uh, she'd be part Replicator for the rest of her life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, Sheppard's not going to go for that.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's a slight possibility I might be able to make them help repair her organic cells and then shut down when they're done, but, uh&#8230;I need more time.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts typing again.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, well I'll leave you to it then. Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[She heads out. McKay is already engrossed in his work again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(absently)<br />
Mmm. Thanks.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm sorry. It's taking longer than I expected. These gloves are making the work so much slower.</blockquote>
<p>[Another micro-asteroid strikes just past Sheppard's shoulder, making a sound like a bullet impacting and causing a large dent and hole in the wall behind them. Sheppard and Zelenka both look at the near-miss.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't worry about it. We've still got four minutes before the energy dips too low and we can't make the jump.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
So&#8230;no pressure then.</blockquote>
<p>[Another micro-asteroid strikes, this one going through Zelenka's right leg before impacting the wall. He gasps in pain as blood corpuscles leak out of his compromised suit.]

<p>[The monitors start beeping rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />

<p>[He turns around for help. Keller and Marie rush in.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(worried)<br />
What did I do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Nothing. It wasn't you, but you need to leave.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon starts backing out.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />

<p>[The pair work on Weir.]

It doesn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're in shock.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka looks down.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
There's a hole in my suit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's okay. I've dialed up controls to create positive pressure. I'm calling a jumper. I've got to get you to O.R.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka holds up a circuit.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We can't leave yet. I have to finish the repairs.</blockquote>

Just tell me what to do.</blockquote>

Elizabeth's crashing. If we're gonna do this thing, we need to do it now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stunned)<br />
Wha&#8212;I need more time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We don't have more time. I can't keep her blood pressure up, and if her ICP continues to climb, there's&#8230;no bringing her back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Okay, I'm transferring the program to you now. I'm on my way.</blockquote>
<p>[He types a few commands onto his computer, then hurries out.]

</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
You know, the easiest thing to do if they really did fall out of hyperspace early, is to fly back over the path between M12-578 and Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Well, that would take over a million years. That's why we have hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We could use the <i>Apollo'</i>s long-range sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Eh, those long-range sensors, they don't work in hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I know. But we could make a little jump, look around, make another little jump, look around, and&#8230;until we find them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Yeah, that's good. So, using those sensors, and&#8230;conservatively, we'd have to make&#8230;ah, one hundred and eighty thousand little jumps.<br />
(acting contemplative to hide his criticism)<br />
It'd take a few years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Unless they seriously augment the long-range sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEE<br />
Oh, yeah. Who's going to do that? It's not like they have an Asgard on board.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter looks mischievous.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Feel like taking a little trip to the Pegasus Galaxy?</blockquote>

There. I'm done.</blockquote>

Why not? Zelenka just finished repairs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />

</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is he going to be okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think so. It didn't hit any major arteries.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Lucky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I wouldn't say that. He's still stuck here just like the rest of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So it's true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We finally fixed the hyperdrive, and now we don't have enough juice to go anywhere. We've only got twenty-eight hours before the shields fail.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right, so what's the plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. I gotta find McKay.</blockquote>

He's in there.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon points to the recovery room.]

(nervous)<br />
I heard we didn't get the array fixed in time.</blockquote>

Look, she was dying, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, her heart was weak, her nervous system was fried.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What did you do?!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks away, exchanging looks with Keller.]

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I reactivated the nanites.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

Look, you were busy! It was life or death! If I didn't act&#8212;</blockquote>

Yes, she would've died. I know!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but helping Elizabeth is not putting us at risk!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(furious)<br />
You just reactivated the Replicator nanites!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're harmless! Look, I am a hundred percent certain they're not going to try to take her over or-or contact the others!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. No, you can't know that for sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stubbornly)<br />
Yes. Yes, I can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shut it down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But&#8230;that would kill her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you think Elizabeth would want? Do you think she'd want this?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, she would. She'd sure as hell do the same for you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then you obviously didn't know her very well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe not, but you know what, give it some time, you can ask her herself!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
NO! It's too dangerous. Shut it down. Right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, I'm not going to.</blockquote>
<p>[He crosses his arms and looks obstinate. Sheppard steps forward menacingly and reaches for his radio.]

</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay, Keller, and Ronon enter the room. Weir sits up in bed, fully conscious and relieved of everything but an i.v. in her arm. She pulls off the bandages covering her head. Her hair has fully regrown to its previous length. She looks around confused.]

<p>[Sheppard finally turns away from the monitor and looks at McKay.]
</p>

None of us wanted to lose you, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And what happens if the nanites are able to contact the other Replicators?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney does not believe that is possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No. It's reckless.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
In my opinion&#8230;it is well worth the risk.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir frowns, looking ready to cry. She leans close to Teyla.]

Well, there's not much point sitting in the infirmary waiting to die, is there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right&#8230;where do we stand?</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck and McKay work on other consoles.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, we can pretty much forget about subspace communications. The main control array was almost completely damaged by the beam. I do, however, have another idea.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sits up, looking skeptical, but holds his tongue. Sheppard glances back towards McKay but does not wait for a response.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's hear it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, the reason why we cannot use the power we have left to execute the short jump to hyperspace is that the city will not let us. It's a safety protocol, but I might be able to bypass it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shakes his head negatively while Zelenka speaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And what does that get us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustically)<br />
Not much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, we wouldn't be able to get to the <i>Apollo</i>, and we wouldn't be able to get to the nearest Stargate, but&#8230;we might be able to find a habitable planet within range. I have my team running sensor sweeps right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's conveniently leaving out the reason why those safety protocols are in place in the first place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, well, with insufficient power, there is a&#8230;chance that the city could be ripped apart as we try to enter the hyperspace window.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What kind of chance?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Fifty-fifty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I gotta tell you, Radek, I'm not loving that idea.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands and faces them, snapping his fingers in inspiration.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Experimental jumper. Remember when I was zapped by that machine a few months ago, and I got, uh&#8230;well, even smarter than I normally am?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The one that almost killed you? Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, before I was reset, I was very close to giving one of our puddle jumpers a hyperdrive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you finish it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah!<br />
(gulping)<br />
Yes, I probably can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, great. We-we'll make a jump to the <i>Apollo</i>. Tell them where we are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why no?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The jumper's hyperdrive would be limited. We wouldn't be able to jump that far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far then?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Zelenka exchange thoughtful looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What do you think, like, two?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, two and change, maybe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Conservatively, maybe two thousand light years. This is a list of addresses that are within range.</blockquote>
<p>[He types up commands on his computer. McKay and Sheppard move to monitor where a map of the region in space appears. Planets with Stargates appear on the map.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we'll make a bunch of trips and ferry the crew to one of the planets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Again, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the drive's never been tested.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, we'd be lucky if we get two jumps.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we'll make a return trip somewhere.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies the map and gets inspired.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, ideally, somewhere with a few ZPMs to spare. We come back, we get Atlantis fully powered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(humoring him)<br />
Yeah, that'd be great.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka stares at what McKay noticed.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
M7R-227.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah&#8230;yeah, we know they have a few ZPMs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And who would that be?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka looks nervous.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That&#8230;that would be the Replicator homeworld. You feel up to a heist?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard licks his lips nervously, considering the idea.]
