</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEW ATHOS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The body of Kanaan lies on a funeral pyre. A heavily pregnant Teyla stands with the rest of her team, Colonel Carter, and some Athosians holding torches.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'm so sorry, Teyla. Kanaan was a good man. He would've made a wonderful father.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I really thought I could save him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You did everything you could. That's all anybody can ask for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
He's at peace now.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla bows her head for several moments, and cries.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
All right. I'm ready.</blockquote>
<p>[The Athosians step forward with their torches. Teyla goes with them. She looks at Kanaan one last time, then takes one of the torches and lights the pyre. She steps back as the Athosians extend the fire. As Teyla watches, Kanaan sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Teyla! Teyla!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(horrified)<br />
He's still alive!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
(beseeching)<br />
Help me, Teyla, please! Please help me!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla starts forward, but Sheppard and Carter hold her back.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He's still alive! Let me go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Teyla, it's too late!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Help me, Teyla! Teyla! Teyla! Teylaaaa!</blockquote>
<p>[The flames surround him, and Kanaan screams in agony.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla awakens in her bed. She looks around in surprise, breathing heavily.]

</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller briefs Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
As you know, for some time now, we've been tracking what appears to be a new sickness in the Pegasus Galaxy. We don't know exactly when or where it started, but so far, we've encountered it on seven different planets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Make that eight.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We just came back from 447. They got it, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Really? The same symptoms?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pauses by the medication table, wiping his hands with a solution.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm. Starts with respiratory difficulty. Proceeds rapidly to fatal organ shut down&#8230;.<br />
(notices them all staring)<br />
Oh, it's, uh, disinfectant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We just came back from the bio-screen, Rodney. We were wearing a hazmat the whole time, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, it's better safe than sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Do we have any idea how it's spread?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, that's the strange part. Most of these planets have no regular contact with each other. But a few of them do have regular contact with other neighboring planets that have been completely unaffected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
How bad is this going to get?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
If I had to make a projection, I'd base it on the evidence from M1R-992. There have been no new cases there for some time, which would seem to indicate the sickness has run its course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It killed thirty percent of the population. If those numbers bear out on the rest of these planets, we're looking at a death toll of about 200,000. That's assuming it doesn't spread out any further.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone exchanges concerned looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla drinks from a mug, looking distracted. McKay comes up behind her. He has a small white box wrapped in blue ribbon, which he holds behind his back as he approaches her. She starts out of her reverie when he arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney! Has Doctor Keller made any progress with her investigation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Unfortunately, not, no. But she-she's still working on it.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla notices McKay awkwardly holding his hands behind his back.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What are you&#8230;hiding?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I um, well, I-I've been waiting for the right time to give this to you. Um, and what with everything that's been going on and all, I, uh&#8230;anyway. Here you go.</blockquote>
<p>[He gives her the gift.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You didn't have to do this, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, think of it as a-as a, kind of a "pre-baby present". Back on Earth, there's this company that produces recordings specifically for the fetus. The thinking is that, by, listening to the works of, say a great composer while still in the womb, the baby will be born with a natural predisposition toward musical ability, or in this case&#8230;science.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla opens the box. It holds a MP-3 player and large earphones.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I-I recorded some of my reflections on some of my more ground-breaking accomplishments and theories&#8230;uh, just a couple hours worth.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You should not have gone to so much trouble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Oh, it was no trouble at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla packs the gift back into the box, already looking distracted once again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Something wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh&#8230;I was debating whether or not to tell anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh! Tell anyone what?</blockquote>
<p>[He sits across from her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe I had a vision last night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
A&#8230;vision?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I saw Kanaan, the father of my son. I believe that he was trying to&#8230;send me a message, that he's alive. And that I must not abandon the search for him and the rest of my people.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay struggles not to look skeptical.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And-and this was while you were sleeping?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
You think it was a dream.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I&#8230;uh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(insistently)<br />
I believe it was more than that. It did not feel like a dream.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay doesn't know where to look. His discomfort is obvious.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I knew you would doubt me. I should not have said anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I've been cocooned inside an alien spacecraft, I've had another person living inside of me, I've encountered not one, but two different versions of myself. So who am I to judge, huh? If you say it was a vision, then I believe it was a vision.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay walks with Sheppard down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I seriously doubt it was a vision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's had them before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's had remote contact with the Wraith, never another human. Besides, those Athosians have been missing for like, what, six months now? Do you really think they're still alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you want me to do, Rodney? Tell her to give up hope?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
At some point, she may not have a choice.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sleeps in her bed. A bright light passes over her. She opens her eyes to find her whole bed is now in a forest.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits at the edge of her bed, looking around. From nothing, specks of light swirl until Kanaan appears before her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Kanaan!</blockquote>
<p>[She gets up and walks towards him.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at her, surprised to see her pregnant. She grins. Kanaan schools his expression to be more somber.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
You must help us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Save us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where are you? Where are our people?</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls off a pendant from around his neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
You bought me this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Do you remember where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The village of Croya. Is that where you are?</blockquote>
<p>[Kanaan drops the pendant into her hand. Her fingers close over it.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Come find me.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla awakens to find herself sitting up in bed in her quarters, her hand still outstretched as if clasping the pendant. She opens her hand as if expecting to see the pendant there, but her hand is empty.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard briefs Carter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She says the pendant in her vision is the same one she gave to Kanaan before he disappeared.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So what's the significance?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, uh&#8230;I'm not sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Well, what does she want, exactly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, she bought it from some guy in a village on M2S-181. She wants to go back and check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
That's a peaceful trading settlement. I'd be very surprised if they had anything to do with the disappearance of the Athosians.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what I said, but she still wants to go. She thinks that Kanaan is sending her a message, a clue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And what do you think?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It doesn't matter. It's Teyla, and we owe her one.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Okay. But we're stretched pretty thin, dealing with this plague.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll try to make it quick.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves her office.]
</p><p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M2S-181 FIELD, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team heads to the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I purchased the pendant from an artisan in Croya, the village we are about to visit. Among the Athosians, it's quite common to present such gifts as expressions of admiration and respect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Hey, maybe I'll pick you something up while we're there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
All right, so we'll ask around, see if we can get some useful intel, but if you even begin to sense any danger&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(interrupting)<br />
I'll make straight for the 'gate, leaving you to deal with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(a bit surprised)<br />
All right, then.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE OF CROYA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Several merchants ply their wares. Teyla approaches a woman setting out her baskets in a booth.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Excuse me. I'm wondering if you can tell me what happened to the artisan who used to occupy this space? He specialized in handcrafted jewelry&#8212;bracelets, pendants, chains&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
He's gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Gone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
During the sickness that took the village several weeks back. He and some forty others. I'm sorry, child. He's dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks stunned.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Carter enters, heading to Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Hey, I hear you have something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah. I found out what's making these people sick, and it's something we've encountered before.</blockquote>
<p>[She leads Carter to a monitor showing a display of molecules.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's a unique protein originally created by the inhabitants of a planet called Hoff. It was designed to interfere with the Wraith's feeding mechanism, making them immune to the process.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It also killed the feeding Wraith and half the people who took it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So this isn't some contagion that spreads naturally.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No. This is mass murder.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sighs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CROYA VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla speaks with a villager, who shakes her head. Sheppard approaches as the villager walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think we're done here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've given this place the twice-over. Nobody knows anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, perhaps someone does and has not seen fit to come forward yet. I was guided here. By showing me the pendant, Kanaan was telling me to come to this village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, you're going through a tough time. You want answers, that's understandable, but you might want to consider it's clouding your judgment&#8230;just a little.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(piqued)<br />
What are you questioning, John? My interpretation of the vision or the vision itself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sternly)<br />
We've been here long enough. If there was something for us to find, we would've found it by now.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs as Sheppard turns away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, Ronon, we're heading out.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Keller briefs Carter, McKay, and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you sure it's the same protein?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I ran a side-by-side comparison. It was almost an exact match.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Almost?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We're dealing with a new and improved version. The Hoffan drug killed fifty percent of the test subjects, and this one only kills thirty percent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, it's still thirty percent too many.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How do the populations of eight different planets get inoculated with a drug and not even know about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's possible it was administered through their food and water supply. We're running some tests.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks startled.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
So who's behind this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, maybe the Hoffans have resumed distribution of the drug, but on a much larger scale.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They haven't been doing much of anything lately. When the Wraith discovered what they were up to, the whole civilization was wiped out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe a few of them survived, and they're planning a little payback.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The random nature of this drug's distribution is clear and calculated. It's obviously intended to throw the Wraith completely off balance. They have no way of knowing which of their food sources have become infected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So it's just a matter of time before they become hungry and cranky. Well, I mean, I know I would.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We need to go back to Hoff. Search what's still standing, see if we can shed some light on the situation before another planet's targeted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. McKay reluctantly follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits meditating.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kanaan appears before her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Teyla&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Kanaan. Where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Who took you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How can I find you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
You already know where to go to uncover the answers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
But you stopped looking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I went. I found nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
You were close. Please, Teyla. Our time is growing short. We need you.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds out his hand to her. She reaches out to grasp it.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Kanaan.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla gasps as she opens her eyes, her hand still outstretched.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CARTER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Carter and Teyla head into her office.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
And you weren't sleeping?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I was in a meditative state, but I was most definitely awake. There can be no doubt. This is real.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter gestures for Teyla to sit in lounge chairs to the side of her desk..]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
But you've already been to the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We missed something. I am certain of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I want to believe you, Teyla, but I'm a scientist. I'm trained to think critically.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is a possible explanation. Kanaan has the gift, the same ability that I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
The Wraith DNA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Among my people, the gift is considered useful, but it also sets one apart. It can be difficult. Kanaan was the only one who could truly understand what it felt like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
It brought you together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is something we have shared since childhood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
But have you ever communicated this way before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter sighs and shakes her head doubtfully.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know what this looks like, Colonel. And I know what everyone is thinking: "she sees what she she wants to see; she believes what she wants to believe." But I assure you, that is not the case.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Carter study each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right. When Colonel Sheppard gets back from Hoff, we'll&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I cannot wait. Kanaan said their time is running short. I must leave immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<p>[She pauses, and they stare at each other again.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not need your permission, Colonel. Unless you intend to restrain me&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major Lorne, come in.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks very concerned by Carter's response.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Go ahead, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Assemble your team. You'll be escorting Teyla back to M2S-181.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs with relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter and Teyla stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
I'm not letting you go back there alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Call me Sam.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you, Sam.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;HOFF, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The city consists of bombed out buildings.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOFF LIBRARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay looks around scattered papers and debris.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Did you find anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio
Just a bunch of junk, you?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;HOFF STREET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard patrols a street.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Nothing. The Wraith did a pretty good number on this place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yeah, this is more than just random destruction. This place used to be the repository of all Hoffan knowledge.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HOFF LIBRARY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing, into radio)<br />
I'd say a lot of it's just missing.</blockquote>
<p>[There is a clatter from behind McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who's there?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the Sheppard and McKay conversation takes place between their respective locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, what's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I thought I heard something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Relax. Probably just rats.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
Rats?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay warily approaches the area where he heard the sound.]
</p>

<blockquote>MERCHANT<br />
You know, I don't want to be difficult here, but I did acquire that merchandise for a price. And while I really don't mind gifting you with an item, from a purely business standpoint, it really doesn't make sense for me to part with my stock&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla ignores the merchant and turns to Lorne.]

<blockquote>LORNE<br />
No! Not that merchandise. The last time I was back on the planet, I spotted what I thought was a fresh grave, a potential new opportunity.

<blockquote>TODD<br />
Effective, yes, and admittedly creative. But the truth is, all of the existing Wraith factions have been adversely affected by this. Our food supply has been so randomly tainted, we have no way of knowing if our next meal will be our last.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, times are tough. Doesn't explain why you called us here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I brought you here, because I need your help. I am aware you had a hand in helping the Hoffans refine this drug. I require whatever research you possess in order that I may synthesize a cure for my hive, and my hive alone.</blockquote>

That's not going to happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You always say that, but you always come around.</blockquote>

Yeah, well, this is different. You know, we're still a little upset over the whole, uh, "Earth conquest" thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(protesting)<br />
I had no part in that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, in an indirect way you did. The Wraith who led the attack was able to access the Midway Station with information that you stole on your last visit to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Information he stole from me in turn! So in a way, we were both victims. But let's save our commiserations for another time. I have a proposal.</blockquote>

Well, temporarily converted. Eventually, he became kind of a&#8230;human-Wraith hybrid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The other Wraith didn't want anything to do with him, so he's been kind of holding a little bit of a grudge ever since.</blockquote>

Well, wait, you're not seriously thinking of&#8230;giving him our research on the Hoffan protein?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Because! We'd effectively be giving the Wraith the means to reproduce the drug and potentially infect and kill millions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Theoretically, yes. But practically, it really wouldn't be in their best interest to poison their own food supply, regardless of whether our research helped them come up with an antidote or not. No, I think the more likely scenario is that they find an antidote that works as a short-term solution to the existing threat. Then they work on weaponizing the protein. You know, coming up with a more effective delivery system, one that cuts out the middle-man, in this case the human victims? No, what we're doing?

</p><p>[Sheppard notices a locked door. They approach and warily start inside. Behind them, someone fires a stunner. They dodge out of the way and return fire. In the ensuing firefight, Ronon is able to stun the shooter, then Sheppard shoots him with his P-90.]
</p><p>[Lorne's team stops to listen to the shooting and determine their next move; they are then fired upon as well. Lorne gives hand signals to his team, then moves into position to return fire.]
</p><p>[Sheppard's team approaches the downed shooter, who's attempting to crawl away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship drops out of orbit above the planet, braking to a halt when it spots <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FEMALE HELMSMAN<br />
Sir, I'm picking up another ship. It's a Wraith cruiser, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Shields up.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith ship shoots at <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The bridge is rocked by the blasts impacting the shields.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Return fire!<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, this is <i>Daedalus</i>, we've been engaged by a Wraith cruiser!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
How's it going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
More than holding our own. Just thought you might want to pick up the pace.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's your boss?</blockquote>
<p>[The shooter doesn't reply. Sheppard pushes him over and points his pistol at his chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHOOTER<br />
You're too early.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And what the hell does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHOOTER<br />
We're expecting him back. He's on his way with an important prisoner.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Ronon, and McKay exchange concerned looks as they realize.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, this is Sheppard, come in. <i>Daedalus</i>, do you read?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The conversation switches between the lab and the <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Sheppard, this is <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do not destroy the enemy ship! I repeat, do not destroy the enemy ship, Teyla may be aboard! Did you hear me? Teyla may be on board!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We heard you.<br />
(to helmsman)<br />
Can you cripple it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FEMALE HELMSMAN<br />
It's possible, sir. It's already sustained some heavy damage. Sir, the enemy is attempting a retreat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Target the engines!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> fires at the Wraith ship, but it takes evasive action and jumps into hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FEMALE HELMSMAN<br />
I'm sorry, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Bad news, Sheppard. The cruiser made the jump to hyperspace. It's gone.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon exchange sorrowful looks.]
</p><p>[Lorne and his men continue to exchange fire with another shooter. The enemy is downed by an energy blast from Ronon's gun. Lorne sees Sheppard's team and he waves his men to join them.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Any sign of her, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's not here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Are you sure? That guard was protecting something.</blockquote>
<p>[They look to the door at the end of the hall. Sheppard's trio takes point. Sheppard shoots the lock, and McKay unlatches the deadbolt and shifts to the side. They kick the door open, weapons at ready.]
</p><p>[The three cannot believe their eyes. Carson Beckett sits on small cot at the end of the cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Finally. It's about bloody time. What took you so long?</blockquote>
<p>[He stands and stares at the men.]
