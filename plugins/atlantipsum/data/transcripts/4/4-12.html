<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[Excerpts from 1.18 "The Gift", 3.18 "Submersion", 4.08 "The Seer", 4.10 "This Mortal Coil", and 4.11 "Be All My Sins Remembered" are shown.]
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The battle above Asuras that took place in 4.11 "Be All My Sins Remembered" continues. The Replicator nanites are swarming to Fran on the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith Commander (Todd) is in charge of the bridge. Another Wraith stands nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
The Replicator ships have ceased firing. The humans' plan worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH COMMANDER<br />
Give me status on the darts!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
Approaching the Replicator city.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Three darts fly through Asuras, one using its beam, as the nanites swarm into a large undulating blob in its center.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
The Replicators' mass is sinking into the planet. We do not have much time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH COMMANDER<br />
We're not leaving without those darts!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Replicators sink into the planet's core.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
The mass is approaching critical density. An explosion is imminent. Commander, we must jump into hyperspace!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH COMMANDER<br />
Not until I get what I came for!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Hyperspace windows open as the Lantian and Traveler ships begin to evacuate the area.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
The darts are on approach&#8230; We have them.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd snarls in triumph.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship leaves just before the planet explodes.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith returns to the bridge, bringing a small case to the commander (Todd).]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECNICIAN<br />
I have the rematerialized cargo from the darts.</blockquote>
<p>[The commander opens the canvas case and pulls out a ZPM. He smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH COMMANDER<br />
Now we have what we need to complete our mission.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard arrive. McKay is already working at a station.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, what've you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's only been a week since the battle, but, uh, a pretty clear pattern is emerging. You can see it on long-range scanners. The Wraith have split up into distinct groups.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Now that they're done with the Replicators, they're sizing each other up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Too many Wraith, not enough humans to feed on. Intel's claiming there are several different factions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, with any luck, they'll find themselves in the middle of a nice, long, civil war. But, uh, what I find particularly interesting is this&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls up a section of space where a locator pings steadily.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that's our old friend, the Wraith that helped me save Jeannie and got us all those hive ships.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How do you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the subspace tracking device he used? It's the same signal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why would he reactivate it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I have no idea. I think it's safe to assume that he'd know we were monitoring that frequency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think he's sending us a message?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe. Look, it's like I said. The hive ships that we've been tracking have formed into distinct groups, but this one's out there by himself. From what we can tell, it's just floating in the middle of empty space, nowhere near a habitable planet, and almost an hour's sub-light from the nearest 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So what does he want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;that's the question.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS WORKOUT ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla rides an exercise bike, exerting herself quite a bit. Ronon enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon! Do you wish to use this machine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No. I just didn't expect to find you here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoots him a glare.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am pregnant, Ronon, not ill. In any case, Doctor Keller said it wouldn't hurt to continue exercising. In fact, it's beneficial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well, you're hitting it pretty hard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, I have to remain in top physical condition if I'm to keep up with you and the rest of the team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who says you have to keep up?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoots him another look, then gives a wry chuckle before concentrating on her workout.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay join Zelenka at a display.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any change?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No. He's still sitting out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's been almost twenty-four hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
His ship could be disabled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm, you think it's a distress call?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, maybe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any other hive ships picking up the signal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
If they are, they're ignoring it. We're showing no other Wraith activity in the area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far did you say the nearest 'gate was?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's about an hour by jumper. Oh! Look, I know we worked with this guy before, and he has helped us out in the past, but he's still a Wraith! We don't seriously feel like we owe him anything, do we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no, of course not. But, that doesn't mean it's not worth checking out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks displeased.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GEAR UP ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's and Lorne's teams get ready for the upcoming mission. Teyla arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel. I just heard. I would like to accompany you on this mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we've got it covered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sternly)<br />
John, I understand what you're trying to do, but I assure you it is not necessary. My skills have not diminished, and I still have much to offer the team.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla's tone has not been missed by the others gearing up. Sheppard catches Lorne's eye and jerks his head for the others to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
All right, guys, let's head out.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
We'll wait for you at the jumper bay, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne's team and Ronon leave. McKay stays seated on the bench. Ronon comes back and drags McKay out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not even&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla are left alone in the room. He grabs a P-90 and continues getting ready.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not having this conversation again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We have not had it <i>yet</i>! In fact, we've barely spoken since I told you I was pregnant!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's been a little busy around here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I understand why you did not want me to join the attack on the Replicator world, but that was a special circumstance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, even the simplest op can become dangerous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And I accept that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think it's that simple?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is this about you trying to protect me, or are you still angry because I did not tell you sooner?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is about your people missing; this is about the father of your child missing. You want to go out, you want to tear it up, you want to kick ass, but you can't! And the sooner you realize that, the better!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stares at Sheppard, shocked and furious. He walks past her, looking troubled.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies through space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and Sheppard's team are inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pull up the HUD. I think we're in range.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay does so. The display shows a schematic of the hive ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've got it, dead ahead. Looks like it's been shot up pretty bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
From the Replicator battle?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I'm picking up residual radiation from Wraith weapons' fire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Were they attacked by another hive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatiently)<br />
Well, it looks that way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any life signs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not picking up anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe they're hibernating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Seems like an odd thing to do after being attacked.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shoots him a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(more meek)<br />
Plus, they usually land the ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Well, we didn't come all this way to turn back. So, we're going in.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's and Lorne's teams have split up, searching the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Lorne, you got anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Nothing so far.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon snaps his fingers and points out two Wraith corpses in the hall.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, we've got bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Acknowledged. We'll keep looking.</blockquote>
<p>[They continue forward. Ronon takes a closer look at one of the Wraith. It is skeletal and dehydrated, almost like a mummy.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Looks like they were fed on.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay continues to read his scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Still picking up the Wraith tracking device. It's that way.</blockquote>
<p>[They move out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH LAB</b>
</p><p>[The scanner beeps more insistently.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Reading's stronger in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't see our guy. You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's scanner focuses on a section of floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're not going to find him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought we were tracking the device.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches down and picks up a small object from the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We are&#8230;but someone cut it out of him.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The derelict hive ship floats in hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Lorne's team joins Sheppard's on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
No sign of the rest of the crew. Whoever attacked the ship must've taken them prisoner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Including our friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(making a face)<br />
Stop calling him that. It's weird.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then what do we call him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. Let's go with&#8230;Todd.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shoots him an incredulous look.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a guy I knew in college. He was very pale.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Todd's a terrible name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You got a better one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As a matter of fact, I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know what? Forget I asked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Colonel, what do we do now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that all depends. Uh, is this thing going to fly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the hull's severely damaged. I'd say about thirty percent of the ship is sealed off and exposed to space.<br />
(brightly)<br />
But, uh, with a bit of work, I think we can get main systems back online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That settles it. We've got ourselves a new ship.</blockquote>
<p>[They smile as Rodney gets to work.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka speaks with someone in a corridor. He notices Sheppard passing by.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay, if you could bring it back to my, uh,&#8230;computer in the lab?</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves the woman to catch up with Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Colonel, I didn't expect to see you back so soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No engagement. The only Wraith on board were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Was the ship badly damaged?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's definitely taken a few hits. McKay's working on repairs, but <i>that</i> is the easy part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, what's the hard part?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shrugs and makes a face.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks away, leaving Zelenka perplexed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits across a table from Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The ship's been secured, there's no immediate danger, and you're the only one who can fly it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(wryly)<br />
Even in my condition?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sighing)<br />
All right, I might have been a little tough on you before&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, you were right. I'm just trying to understand my position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're still a member of my team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Am I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You always were! Look, it's my call whether or not you go on mission. Take it or leave it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(after a long pause)<br />
When do we go?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits back, relieved.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Lorne enters. McKay and Ronon are there.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Hey. I found these in the jumper.</blockquote>
<p>[He tosses power bars to McKay and Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, thank you. I'm starving!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies the label of his and makes a face.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Apricot Jubilee?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Oh, if you don't want it&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He holds out his hand to take it back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no. It's fine.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens his bar. In the background, Ronon leans close to one of the Wraith consoles.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
So, how are we doing in here, anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eh, it's coming along. I got the hyperdrive operational, though that's not going to help much if I can't get the neural interface to work.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon's actions cause a screech. The interface comes to life.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What'd you do?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stands up straight, furtively trying to look innocent.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You touched something, didn't you!?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No&#8230;Maybe just a little.</blockquote>
<p>[They look at the display showing lots of Wraith data, displaying a region in space.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Looks like a map.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you, Captain Obvious. Of course it's a map. The question is, a map to what?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper flies through space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I wanted to tell you sooner, but I found out shortly after Doctor Keller and I returned from New Athos. It was a difficult time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's okay. I get it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Now, along with everything else, I'm burdened with the thought that&#8230;this child may be the last of my people.</blockquote>
<p>[Her voice breaks as she tries not to cry.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We don't know that yet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But you understand why I cannot just stay in Atlantis and do nothing! My best hope in learning their fate is to be out here with you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks away and bites his lip.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla join the others on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, you're back! Well, I've managed to get the neural interface talking to the main systems, but I've got no way to test it, so it's-it's gonna need some tweaking. Biggest problem I've had so far has been with the weapons array, but I think I've managed to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wait&#8230;weapons array?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I-I thought they'd come in handy when we go after the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I figured out where this ship was headed before it was attacked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
<i>We</i> figured it out.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon turns and makes a face at Teyla, who puts down a case and looks at one of the panels.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, right. All you did was activate a screen! I'm the one who searched through the ship's log and found the mention of the top secret Wraith outpost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What Wraith outpost?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry. I assumed a level of uncertainty was implied by my use of the phrase "top secret."</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
In other words, he doesn't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The log didn't specify. But whatever this thing is, they talk about this thing like it was sacred. From what I can gather, it played a pivotal role in helping the Wraith win their war against the Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Which is why we got to check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All, right, hold on here a second. Let's just slow down. We don't even know if this thing can fly, let alone&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The engine hums to life as behind them, Teyla activates the controls. They heads over to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awed)<br />
How did you do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I&#8230;don't know. My abilities appear to be stronger than before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(studying displays)<br />
Oh, she's not kidding. According to this, navigation, propulsion, and communications are online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I cannot explain it. The moment I connected with the ship, everything became available to me. I can feel the various systems at my disposal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, can you fly it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm not sure.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla closes her eyes and concentrates.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship's engines power up and it starts moving slowly in sublight speed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's flying it all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla opens her eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(surprised)<br />
Yes. I'm fine. It's easier than it was last time. It's almost&#8230;effortless.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't do anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The coordinates to the outpost are in the computer. I can take us there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
Mmm, that's not why I brought you here. We can wait for the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The hive that attacked this ship had access to the same information, and by now, it is almost a day ahead of us. Now, if that outpost is as important as the log suggests, do you really think we can afford to wait?</blockquote>

There's one thing I don't understand: Back when you defeated the Ancients, how did you get your hands on the ZPM?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
The Lantians were powerful, but careless. Believing their ships were unbeatable, they sent them deeper and deeper into Wraith-controlled territory, trying to weed us out. It took months, but eventually, we were able to capture three of them, each one powered by a ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

</p><p>[The queen sways on her feet as Sheppard's team rearms themselves.]
</p>
<blockquote>QUEEN/TEYLA<br />
You must go, quickly! I don't know how much longer I can control her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go. Move.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon heads out, weapon raised.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, could you get her to tell us which way? 'Cause I kinda got turned around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sharply)<br />
Just go!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay follows Ronon out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can let go of her now, we're leaving.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to follow the others. Teyla, in the queen's body doubles over with a cry.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA/QUEEN'S MIND</b>
</p><p>[Teyla rocks in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
(triumphant)<br />
There it is! The other life inside you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH HOLDING CELL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla, in the queen's body, gasps as she looks over to Sheppard, who's watching her warily.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla&#8230;? Let go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN/TEYLA<br />
John&#8230;help me!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard raises his pistol and shoots the queen several times. The weakened queen collapses.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla falls back, wheezing for breath. Lorne is instantly by her side.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH OUTPOST CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard runs and joins the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's pull up those ZPMs and get the hell out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The only problem is we have no idea where they are, remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We pulled up the schematics in the pod room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It didn't have any reference to ZPMs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe you didn't look hard enough. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;QUEEN THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith scientist enters and punches up controls on a side console.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH OUTPOST POD ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team run into a pod room alcove. McKay starts grabbing for his computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Make this quick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's a lot of data; I'm going to need a minute.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;QUEEN THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith looks at something on his console as a signal beeps.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH OUTPOST POD ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Machinery begins humming.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<p>[The humming grows louder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're too late.</blockquote>
<p>[All the pods are coming to life.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They've started to clone the warriors!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Forget that, just find the ZPMs!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm going to need more time!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, there are hundreds of pages of information here, and it's all in Wraith!</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm klaxon blares.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They found the queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I got a better idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grabs his computer, and they all run out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla rides through the pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Teyla, are you okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(confused)<br />
Major Lorne?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I saw them! Colonel Sheppard&#8230;Ronon&#8230;Doctor McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Did they get away?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(upset)<br />
The queen was&#8230;was going after my child!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
It's okay. It's okay. Just take it easy, all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Alerts sound at some of the control panels.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(worried)<br />
Major? The other hive is on its way. They've found us.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne stands. Teyla tries to compose herself, but clutches her abdomen, still in pain and looking afraid.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH OUTPOST DOOR</b>
</p><p>[The trio arrive near a guarded door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispering)<br />
Isn't there another way out of here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispering fiercely)<br />
You want a different exit? It was hard enough to find this one!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon, watching their rear, looks alarmed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You better make a decision fast. We've got more of them coming.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks back and sees a guard patrol heading their way.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, crap.</blockquote>
<p>[He raises his P-90 and shoots the guards at the door. McKay assists while Ronon takes out the guards behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get out of here!</blockquote>
<p>[The firefight continues as they rush to the exit and run outside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Todd works the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
The hive ship will be here momentarily. We need to leave now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Not before our people get back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Weapons capabilities are limited at best. The hull is still severely damaged. We can't survive an attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard will be here shortly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You don't know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(insistent)<br />
I have seen them! They are alive, and we will wait for as long as is necessary.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd spins angrily, but an alert beeps insistently before he can speak.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
The other hive. They've entered weapon's range.</blockquote>
<p>[An explosion rocks the ship.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The queen's hive ship fires on the damaged hive ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
This is foolish. They will target our hyperdrive, making it impossible to escape. We can't wait any longer.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies quickly away from the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Teyla, Lorne, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel, where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're on our way.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
You must hurry. The other hive has found us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Can you hold them off?</blockquote>
<p>[Todd strides over to the weapons console.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(grumbling)<br />
Not for long.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The two hive ships engage in a firefight, the damaged one making out the worse of the pair.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Approaching dart bay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Acknowledged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
They're inside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel, request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Negative. I have another idea.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you crazy?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We still have to destroy the cloning facility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How?! In case you hadn't noticed, we're under attack!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know!<br />
(into radio)<br />
Teyla, I want you to set a new course.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Still under fire from the other hive ship, the damaged one leaves the moon's orbit and heads towards the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;QUEEN THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Another Wraith, the one who served as the technician/second for Todd, enters the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
Commander!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
We've just received an urgent communication from the hive. The enemy&#8230;they're headed straight for us.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith scientist turns and stares at the messenger.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WRAITH OUTPOST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The damaged hive ship crashes directly into the outpost. The explosion is huge.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Both Sheppard's and Lorne's teams watch the explosion from inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shaken)<br />
Well, I think that should probably do the trick.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DUSK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka walks with Sheppard and McKay up the steps from the gate room to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
So, what happened to the other Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean Todd?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka looks puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't ask.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He took a dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Either he escaped through the 'gate like we did, or he was captured by the other hive ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I can't imagine they would've given him a very warm welcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[They continue. Sheppard pauses at the top of the steps, noticing Teyla alone on the balcony.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard joins Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Talk to Keller?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I've just come from the infirmary. Everything is fine&#8230;at least&#8230;physically.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks away, taking a deep breath before continuing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I exposed my unborn child to the mind of a killer&#8230;even before he's opened his eyes on the world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
It's a boy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really? I thought you didn't want Keller to tell you anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(disturbed)<br />
She didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
You were right to question my involvement in this mission. There was a time when I would've laid my life down for you, or Ronon, or Rodney without hesitation. But&#8230;I have other considerations now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's understandable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(frightened)<br />
You have no idea how close she came to extinguishing his life. If you had hesitated&#8230;for even a moment&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sniffs back tears. Shaking her head she steps forward and hugs Sheppard. Sheppard hesitantly hugs her back.]
