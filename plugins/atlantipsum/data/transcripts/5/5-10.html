</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
I don't know what all the fuss is about. If we do this every time someone comes for a visit, we'd never get any work done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're just meeting him at the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're not just meeting him at the 'gate! I've been pulled from my regular duties to help him with his "database research." I've got stuff on the go, you know&#8212;important, vital projects for the-the betterment of the human race.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Apparently there are other people doing equally important work, Rodney, as hard as that is to believe.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay join Woolsey in front of the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
An exciting day!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Absolutely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grumbling)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(calling from control room balcony)<br />
He's ready to beam!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel Jackson beams down in front of the Stargate. He is dressed in civilian clothes and carries two bags. He wears an elated smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Jackson, welcome to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(excited)<br />
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey, it's great to be back. Colonel Sheppard. Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grumbles unintelligibly and makes a put-upon sigh.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey leads Daniel and McKay down the hall.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'll have Rodney here show to your quarters. I'm sure&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Actually, I'd like to get started right away, if that's okay with you, Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unenthusiastic)<br />
Oh, sure, sure. Whaddya got planned? An exciting exploration of insignificant Ancient historical events?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
No, not quite. I'm sure you're both familiar with the Ancient named Janus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The inventor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, he was their lead scientist and apparently a bit of a renegade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, and I've been over all of his logs. Look, this is work we've done already.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, I'm pretty sure I have information that could lead us to his secret lab.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stops walking and turns to face Daniel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dubious)<br />
Secret lab?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, a place where he conducted and subsequently hid a significant portion of his unauthorized research. And if I'm correct, it's right here&#8230;on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay exchanges looks with Woolsey.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Daniel pours over a computer. McKay sits beside him, his head leaning on one arm, looking bored.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've been over Janus's database entries with a fine-toothed comb. I never saw any mention of a secret lab.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Janus was doing a lot of work that wasn't exactly approved by the Ancient Council, so it's not hard to imagine he wouldn't include a full accounting in this very public database. I mean, do you include all of your research in your official reports?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just get to the point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Okay. He never talked about it in his entries, but several of Janus's peers suspected he had a "bastion of unfettered thought and experimentation." Or, as one of his lovers put it&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He had lovers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
"An isle of solitude within the city walls."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that could just mean he was hard to talk to! People say things like that about me all the time!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Now, none of these writers had any idea where the lab could be, but one of his young assistants recalls a day where Janus turned a corner down a hallway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh! "Today, I saw Janus in the hallway." There's a real page turner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(ignoring McKay)<br />
He chased after him with a question about his work, but when he rounded the corner, Janus was gone. The hallway was a dead-end. He had seemingly disappeared, and I think, into his secret lab.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(intrigued)<br />
Well, did this assistant happen to mention&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
&#8230;which hallway? Yes, he does.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm. Well&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls the computer into his lap.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(smug)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Woolsey walk down a corridor. Woolsey carries a duffel bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
As soon as the <i>Daedalus</i> unloads its supplies, we'll be heading off to meet up with Todd and one of his hives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You really think he's going to show up, huh? And let you guys try out Doctor Keller's gene therapy on a few of his guys?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, we held up our end of the deal. We let him use Teyla to take control of an alliance of Wraith hives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what I'm saying. He's got what he wants. I should go with you, because I have a relationship with Todd&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That is precisely why I <i>don't</i> want you there&#8230; This mission is basically going to be a negotiation, and Todd has, well, less baggage with me than he does with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(frustrated)<br />
Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't take the lead on this, I'm just&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(firmly)<br />
You're second-in-command here, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[They stop at the foot of a staircase.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I know my predecessors played fast and loose with many of the rules set forth by the IOA, but protocol plainly states that in the rare instance where I am required to leave Atlantis, you stay put. You're in command here until I get back. Understood?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rolls his eyes and twitches, but nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(smiling)<br />
Try not to blow her up while I'm gone.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey starts up a staircase.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No promises.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey pauses and spins, watching Sheppard walk away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller supervises an aide packing a case.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, I think this should be the last of it.</blockquote>
<p>[The aide nods and leaves with the bag. Ronon enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hi! I was, uh, just leaving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, I know. Here, let me get that.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs a bag as she reaches for it.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So you're going on this <i>Daedalus</i> thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, Uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Keller reaches for another duffle, and Ronon snatches it before she can touch it.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Un-uh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Thank you. I kinda have to. I'm the one that's gonna be administering the treatment&#8230;if, you know, we ever get to that point.</blockquote>
<p>[They begin walking.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Right. I think I should come with you on this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Really? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't really trust these guys.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You don't trust Todd and his Wraith? Or&#8230;the entire crew of the <i>Daedalus</i> to protect me if something goes wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know. Both I guess.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller stifles a chuckle.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(laughing)<br />
Nothing, nothing. It'd be great to have the company.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[They see Daniel and McKay walking nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Bye, Rodney. Wish us luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(absently)<br />
Good luck.<br />
(stopping short)<br />
What do you mean "us"?</blockquote>
<p>[He watches Keller and Ronon walk through another door, Ronon shooting McKay a sly grin as he walks by. Daniel doubles back and stands over McKay's shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Rod? You wanna?</blockquote>
<p>[He thumbs down the hallway and tries to lead McKay that way. McKay distractedly follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Daniel and McKay enter a corridor that lights up as they enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Is that a water line up there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, this section of the city flooded the first year we were here. Anything salvageable got moved to the main tower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, it's remote. That's promising. He wouldn't want anyone around when he came in and out of his lab.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Ooh, like the Batcave!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(drily)<br />
Yes&#8230;just like the Batcave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm not picking up anything unusual&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel pauses and looks at a small rectangular opening on one of the wall beams.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Something used to be attached here.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands by another one.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmph. And here.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel notices one in the beam between the ones he and McKay already indicated.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
And another one. Any idea what they are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unimpressed)<br />
Looks like a run-of-the-mill sconce interface.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Right. Well&#8230;where are the sconces?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. Maybe the decorator changed his mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel raises his eyebrows dubiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
You said after the flood, anything worth salvaging was moved to the main tower. Now, please tell me you kept detailed records of what was found and where.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did we keep detailed records? Who are you talking to here?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[Changing the view from the corridor off a pier up to the central tower.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Daniel flip through camera footage of the base on a large monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
There! That-that's the hallway! Can you, uh, can you zoom in there?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes at Daniel but zooms into the part he points to on the picture. Three light fixtures sit on the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There. There are your light fixtures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
They must've been knocked loose during the flood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Possibly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
But you salvaged them, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're lights that fell to the ground during a flood. It's not like they're gonna&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(with tight smile)<br />
Just&#8230;humor me, okay? I think we're on to something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The view changes from the tower to a building on another pier.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STORAGE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Daniel and McKay search through shelves storing all sorts of containers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here they are. I've got 'em.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel comes over to the case that McKay opens. The three light fixtures are packed in foam.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The view changes from the storage building over to the far pier and the abandoned corridor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Daniel finishes putting in the last sconce. It makes humming tone as it lights up. McKay looks puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
That's odd. Each of these three lights made a different tone when I plugged them in. Does that&#8230;usually happen around here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(slowly)<br />
Not usually, no.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel taps each sconce. Each one plays a different tone.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they've been banged around a lot, underwater for a few days. Maybe they're just broken.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
No, it's a puzzle. I think we need to activate these in a specific order.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
What, you mean like a three digit code? You know how easy that would be to break? There's only six variations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(impatient)<br />
Well, maybe we need to activate them a number of times in a specific order. I don't suppose you recognize any of these three notes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
What, you mean like, does it remind me of Janus's favorite Brian Eno track? No. No such luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, Janus's assistant said he disappeared pretty quickly down the hallway, so it can't be a long code. Maybe it's just as simple as three tones in a row.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Go for it.</blockquote>
<p>[Bored, McKay wanders further down the hall while Daniel plays with variations of the order of the tones, waiting for something to happen. McKay pauses at the end of the hall, pressing against the wall and looking puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hold on for a second.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come here and push against this wall.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Please, just&#8230;humor me. I think I'm onto something.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel and McKay switch places.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, on the count of three, I want you to push against the wall as hard as you can, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, one&#8230;two&#8230;three.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel shoves against the wall. McKay taps each sconce as he walks by left to right, each tone becoming slightly higher. Daniel falls through the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(muffled)<br />
Oof!</blockquote>
<p>[He disappears from view. McKay stares at the blank wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Son of a bitch.</blockquote>
<p>[He touches the three lights again, walking steadily down the hall and through the wall as the tones still ring.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JANUS'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay walks into the darkened lab. Daniel is still lying on the floor where he fell, looking dazed.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Ow.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay kneels next to Daniel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Controlled magnetic harmonic resonance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Apparently Tesla was close to something like this before Edison trashed his lab.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel shakes his head as if to clear his vision.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That wall was specially designed to destabilize when bombarded with a very specific harmonic resonance. That's what the tones were! And the strong magnetic property of the particles is what keeps the door from just crumbling into dust. It's a great way to hide a door, because, you know, if you're looking for a door to open, it's never going to be found. It's like a hologram, only better because it-it's solid mass until the tones are playing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(drily)<br />
Right, so you could've just told me to <i>walk</i> through the door when you did it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I could have, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, yes.</blockquote>
<p>[He rolls his eyes and stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Where the hell are we?</blockquote>
<p>[Once they're both standing, the monitors and consoles in the room all light up, illuminating many devices and control consoles.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(awed)<br />
Wow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Janus's secret lab!</blockquote>
<p>[They move to one of the consoles to study it. Neither notices a small console with a red light blinking.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[An icy planet floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB ON PLANET</b>
</p><p>[A red light blinks on a console filled with Ancient crystals. A few moments later all the crystals light up, and monitors come to life near them. An alien wearing armor and a helmet watches.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALIEN<br />
Alert the others. The device has been activated.</blockquote>

</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits at a table, going over notes. Keller grabs a water bottle from the supply table and spots him.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hey, Mr. Woolsey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Keller.<br />
(looking around)<br />
Where's your burly protector? It's odd to see you without him, nowadays.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(smiling)<br />
He's&#8230;in the lab. What're you working on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
A speech.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, this is a&#8230;fairly momentous occasion. The Wraith will take a step forward, not only for their own benefit, but for that of the entire galaxy. It's an historic day. I just think it deserves some&#8230;recognition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, what have you got so far?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
"Today is an historic day&#8230;"</blockquote>
<p>[He looks up and bites his lip.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(weakly)<br />
It's a&#8230;good place to start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, it's a work in progress.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange awkward looks and Keller leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JANUS'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard steps through the wall. The room is filled with scientists studying the devices. Daniel studies one console and large monitor. McKay looks up when Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa. That's pretty cool.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Harmonic resonance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I was told. But what happens if the sound goes off and you're in the middle of the&#8230;wall?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the wall would break apart your body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe we should, uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside. The wall is now permanently open. Don't worry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. So what do we got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, the good news is it's definitely Janus's secret lab; the bad news is getting in was the easy part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There are levels of encryption on all of the data here that even the most paranoid NSA agent wouldn't use. I mean, it is deep.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel walks over to join them. He sits beside Rodney.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Some of them are straight up math ciphers while others are Ancient knowledge puzzles.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And until we start deciphering, there's no way to tell what any of this stuff does.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sounds like you guys make a good team, though.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel looks up, disturbed, while McKay shifts uncomfortably.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(noncommittally)<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(drily)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I guess I'll go back to being the boss.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How's that going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pretty boring, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you're more than welcome to help us crack this first stream cipher.<br />
(to Daniel)<br />
You know, um, he could've been in Mensa.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel grins, amused, while McKay stifles a laugh. Sheppard glowers at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why don't you contact me when you two geniuses have a breakthrough?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Will do.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves, walking past the small device on a podium, still blinking the red light.]

<blockquote>TODD<br />
Thank you for having us.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey straightens and clears his throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(formally)<br />
Today is an historic day. Robert Grosseteste once said&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />

I would like to get started as soon as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Yes, of course. But I wanted to recognize&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I have my doubts that your plan will be effective. So shall we drop these unfounded pleasantries and get to work?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Very well. Doctor Keller, lead the way.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods.]

Just a little.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But the truth is, I really didn't think you were going to find anything!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, that much I actually understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yeah. I've&#8230;spent the majority of my professional life being ridiculed for my theories&#8212;most of which turned out to be correct, by the way. I'm kinda used to it, Rodney.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Doesn't that bother you? I mean, no vindication, no recognition, no&#8230;credit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, I could say the same thing about you. The discoveries you've made, you&#8230;probably could've won the Nobel Prize five times over by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(relaxing)<br />
Too true. So, I guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(deadpan)<br />
No, we did it for the money.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel grins. McKay snickers.]

<p>[They watch the display as the alien ship reaches Atlantis through the shield and then moves into the city over one of the far piers.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
That's impossible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, wh-what did it just do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
It passed through the shield.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but how did it do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(worried)<br />

<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(nervous)<br />
They should be right in front of you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The aliens take the metal plates off their backs and attach them to each other on the floor, forming a large disc. They attach a small round device to its center and twist the control. The disc lights up and makes a humming noise. The aliens step onto it as Sheppard's team arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't move!</blockquote>
<p>[One of the aliens touches a control on its breastplate. A domed shield comes up from the disc, protecting the aliens as Sheppard's team opens fire. The shielded disc drops through the floor, leaving a large hole in its place.]
</p><p>[Sheppard's team stops firing and approaches the hole. The disk has moved down at least six floors and is continuing its descent. Some Atlantis expedition members can be seen in other floors looking through the holes on their floors in puzzlement.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's at the bottom of this tower?</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio, worried)<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<p>[He and Daniel both stand, alert and concerned at Sheppard's tone, as the two aliens walk through the wall-door. The aliens stun them both with an energy weapon. One alien grabs the device with the red blinking light off the table. They ignore the other equipment.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ABANDONED CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team arrives. The alien punches a button on its arm and a yellow force field appears. He holds his arm as if grasping a shield while Sheppard's team fires. The bullets don't get through, but the alien appears to be struggling to hold his ground. The two aliens return from Janus's lab. One carries the device. The other drags the unconscious bodies of McKay and Daniel behind him, holding each of them by one arm.]
</p><p>[While the third alien continues to block the gunfire with the shield, the other two step onto the disc, the one holding Daniel and McKay by their collars, lifting the limp bodies so they're upright. The dome shield encompasses the two aliens and their booty. It levitates up through the hole in the ceiling, leaving their compatriot to fall as the force field fails and the alien is hit by multiple bullet wounds.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The domed disc flies up through the tower levels straight into the sky and into the waiting opening of the alien ship. The ship closes its door and immediately flies off, flying across the city and through the shield without difficulty. It jumps into hyperspace while still in the planet's atmosphere.]

Is it alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You tell me.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka runs his scanner over the alien.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No. I'm not getting any coherent readings. Perhaps we should put it under a medical scanner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(to scientist)<br />
Go get a gurney.</blockquote>
<p>[The scientist hurries away. Zelenka looks up at the circular hole in the ceiling and purses his lips.]

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That much I got. Thanks. By who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I was kinda hoping you could tell me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, there is no way this is a coincidence. I mean, we discover Janus's super-secret lab, and less than twenty-four hours later, a bunch of aliens show up all guns blazing? Don't you think that's a little odd?</blockquote>

Unfortunately, we haven't had nearly enough time to go through everything we found in here, so there's no way of knowing exactly what they took.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All this stuff came on when Rodney and Doctor Jackson came in here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, pretty much. It probably activated in response to Rodney's ATA gene. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What if something in here's been broadcasting?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ALIEN PRISON CELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A subspace signal. It's the only possible answer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've come across them before. They're a-a real-time practically instantaneous link between two Ancient devices. They can be separated by like, half a galaxy.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;JANUS'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's a bunch of aliens out there. They-they stumble upon an Ancient lab, probably built by Janus himself. It's dormant. It's not working. Then one day, out of the blue, it&#8230;activates.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ALIEN PRISON CELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So they're standing around, they're scratching their heads, they have no idea what's going on. Then they discover the subspace link.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They decide to follow it. They trace it back to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(dubious)<br />
And then attack us and take two of our people hostage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney and Doctor Jackson were not the targets.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
We're probably on a ship traveling through hyperspace, where are we gonna go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll think of something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yep. Always do.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches out and touches one of the beams. It zaps his finger with a violent hum.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Oh yeah, I tried that. They, uh, zap you when you touch them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
You could have told me that <i>before</i> I touched it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(blandly)<br />
I could have. Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay glowers at Daniel.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Look, they stripped us of everything but the clothing on our backs and surrounded us with laser walls. I'm not sure how much play we have here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've got one thing going for us at least.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(sighing)<br />
It's no good. I'm still not getting any useful readings. The suit is emitting some sort of E.M. field that's disrupting the scanner. I&#8230;have no idea how to shut it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's no way to penetrate the shell and see what's under there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you think there's a human underneath all that armor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Impossible to say. It could be a robot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
One thing's for sure&#8212;it's not like anything we've ever seen before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, Doctor Weir did say that there were other technologically advanced societies that we have yet to encounter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've just made first contact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What do you want me to do?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steps over to look at the alien.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Cut it open.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, Zelenka uses a power-saw to try to slice open the breastplate. Another scientist, wearing goggles like Zelenka, holds the alien's head in place. Sheppard and Teyla stand nearby. The saw whirs with a higher and higher pitched whine. Zelenka finally shuts it down and lifts his goggles to study the saw.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Ach! It's no good. I just dulled out the blade!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard bites his lip and studies the alien.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

<p>[Zelenka notices a small light blinking on the breastplate. He stops his saw. There is a beeping with the blinking.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Uh-oh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get out. Everyone. Get out!</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone runs out of the room, taking cover in the corridor outside just before the alien self-destructs in a fiery explosion.]

I get it. What you're doing is difficult. Just&#8230;tell me when you get a hit.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks away. Zelenka sighs and gets back to work.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay bites his thumb and looks through a window at a device in a shielded chamber. He steps back to the console. Daniel is at the other console.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
This facility is tapped into some pretty serious power generation. I've never seen anything like it before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(half to himself)<br />
You'd need a lot of power&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think I know what this thing does.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's an endgame machine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(cautiously)<br />
How so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If it works the way I think it does, it would mean the end of the Wraith once and for all!</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel stares at McKay in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
So, how do you destroy the Wraith once and for all?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I never said "destroy", I mean&#8230;it would lead to that, I suppose. But&#8230;this device would stop them dead in their tracks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
How?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks over to Daniel's console.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It creates a very specific subspace static. Uh, turbulence is probably a better way of looking at it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Which&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, look. Um, although they're all based on a fairly similar technological premise, each race has a slightly different type of hyperdrive. Ours are based on the Asgard drives with their own little twist. The Ancients had their own particular system. And the Wraith, again, have their own separate hyperdrive technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances by entering and exiting subspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(impatient)<br />
Okay. This much I already know. Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Daniel walk back to the other console.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, so if this machine is capable of actually functioning safely, it disrupts the very specific subspace frequencies the Wraith use.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
So they wouldn't be able to engage their hyperdrive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well that's the genius. They <i>would</i> be able to engage their hyperdrive. It's just that their particular channel of subspace would be destabilized, and the ship would be ripped into a million pieces.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
When this device is turned on, every time a Wraith ship enters hyperspace, it self-destructs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
That's a pretty effective idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. I mean, because, even if word got back to the other Wraith that the ships should stop using their hyperdrives, they'd be stuck where they were. They'd only be able to travel using sub-light engines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Because an Ancient ship's hyperdrive operates on a different frequency of subspace, the Ancients could fly around the galaxy and pick them off one by one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, or just&#8230;leave them to die in the vastness of space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
So, what's the catch?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns back to the other console. Daniel follows him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, well, the catch is that Janus ran a three-day test about&#8230;ten thousand years ago and then, shut the whole project down because of "unforeseen side effects."</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Right. Which were&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls up a screen on the Ancient lab monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it-it's not clear. But, that's the key to the whole shebang.</blockquote>
<p>[He points to the device the aliens took from Janus's lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, Janus brought that back with him to Atlantis but kept it connected to the main system here. One won't work without the other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, they seem pretty convinced we can make it operational.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's because we probably can. I mean, we have everything we need here. The question is, whether we should. The last time I went down this road, I&#8230;I kinda destroyed a solar system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yeah, and I'm not too keen about experiencing those "unforeseen side effects."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, what do we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
It's simple. We, uh&#8230;we&#8230;reason with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(deflating)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, the alien stands listening to Daniel. McKay looks uncertain at this tactic.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Now, obviously you're excited over the possibility of ending the Wraith's reign over this galaxy once and for all. But, uh, the reality is, this device and this facility were abandoned by their creator for very good reasons. See, uh, it doesn't work&#8230;at least, not safely. That's from what my friend can tell.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay waves weakly. The alien doesn't respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Look, we share the same goal. Perhaps we have many things in common.</blockquote>
<p>[The alien still does not answer. Daniel looks to McKay then back.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Look, given the right amount of time it's possible we could get the device to function safely, but, uh, we'd have to contact our people and bring in a much <i>larger</i> science team. See, I'm-I'm-I'm not that kind of scientist, and, and what my friend here&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel points to McKay but the alien interrupts, turning to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALIEN<br />
Get the device operational within one hour, or I will kill him. Do you understand?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(meekly)<br />
I understand, yes.</blockquote>
<p>[The alien leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Great plan, Danny! Great plan!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay moves to one of the consoles. Daniel remains in place, putting his hands in his pockets and musing.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Why the suits?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, they're not in battle anymore. Originally I thought it was just their version of SWAT gear, but&#8230;they still have it on. Maybe they're more than just armor; maybe they're some sort of protective suit. Maybe they can't function in our livable atmosphere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatient)<br />
Maybe we should just add it to the list of things that have nothing to do with the task at hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Those suits might be the key to figuring out who these guys really are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
Well, you work on understanding them, I'll work on trying not to get us killed.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay works at a console. Daniel stays deep in thought.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you got something for me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. M6H-987. That's my best guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, about 80% sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Well, it's our only lead. It'll have to do. Doesn't happen to have a 'gate on it, does it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course not. <i>Daedalus</i> still out of communications range?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, I'm afraid so. And the rendezvous point with Todd isn't even near a Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I need to get to the jumper bay. Boost its subspace communications range as much as you can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What are you planning?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we've got to get to that planet as soon as possible. We're gonna gate as near as we can to the <i>Daedalus</i> with a jumper. Have them pick us up en route to the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. Give me half an hour.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts typing. Sheppard heads out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going to get the team ready.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Daniel look into the shielded chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That main chamber houses the subspace antenna.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
It harnesses the static into subspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it will once I light it up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(surprised)<br />
What? You're already ready?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks back to the consoles. Daniel follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it wasn't broken! He just shut it down. All you need is that,
(points to device)<br />
&#8230;a basic understanding of Janus's coding style, and, uh, here's where I come in again, the Ancient gene. I mean, we're-we're ready to roll.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Rodney, you don't have to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Look, if-if turning this thing on means a-a solar system is gonna explode, then let's&#8230;not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're going to kill you! We don't have a choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, so I do nothing, they come in here, they kill you. Who gets killed next, huh? Me. To tell you the truth here, I'm quite fond of me. So we might as well do it, you know, now, while you're still alive as opposed to as opposed to, you know, then.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel rolls his eyes and shrugs, resigned.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay powers up the device.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT SHIELDED CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[The machine powers up. Lightning arcs spark around the room and the large machine glows with a blue light.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Daniel turn and watch the light show through the small window.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
We still alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(quietly)<br />
I think so. I'd hate to think heaven looks like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who says we went to heaven?</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel raises his eyebrows in consideration. McKay whimpers. They both step towards the console closer to the shield door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's operational.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Anything out of the ordinary?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chuckling, pleased)<br />
No. Everything's in the green. I mean, it's working great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What about those "unforeseen side effects"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're still unforeseen. For now, it's working, and we're still alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Okay, so, what now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(hopefully)<br />
Uh, maybe, uh, a nice pat on the back, and an all-expense paid trip back to Atlantis?</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel raises his eyebrows and shoots McKay a skeptical look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(deflating)<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Todd walks into the bridge escorted by two guards. Woolsey is there to meet him and hands him an earpiece.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You have an urgent message from your hive. I assumed you'd want to take it privately.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd takes the earpiece warily and steps forward from the bridge crew.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead&#8230;Very well&#8230;Permission granted&#8230;I shall remain here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Is everything okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(grunting)<br />
One of our facilities is under attack by a rival hive. Our two support ships must depart for battle. My hive will remain here, continue the work with Doctor Keller.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(smiling)<br />
I'm glad to hear that.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd and Caldwell both stare at Woolsey, incredulous.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Oh! Not the under attack part. That's unfortunate, of course. I just meant&#8230;never mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd turns to look out the forward viewscreen.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Two hive ships break formation at the rendezvous and open a hyperspace window. As they try to enter hyperspace, they blast apart into dust.]

(alarmed)<br />
Marks, what the hell just happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(horrified)<br />
How did you do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How did we&#8230;?! Surely, you don't think we had anything to do with that&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You tricked me.</blockquote>
<p>[He slowly turns, unobtrusively releasing a small bar from each sleeve.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
This was your plan all along. Somehow, you've found the Attero device!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The what? We have no idea what you're&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Todd connects the two activated bars. They emit a blast wave that stuns everyone on the bridge into unconsciousness. Todd steps to the commander's chair and activates the communicator.]
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between Todd's bridge, where his second in command, Kenny stands, and Todd on video screen at the </i>Daedalus<i> bridge.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
Commander. We've been trying to contact you. The other cruisers were destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I know. We've been betrayed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
What should we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I have control of the humans' transport system. I will begin beaming in our troops immediately.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits down in the command chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
We're taking this ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon walks casually down a corridor. As he turns a corner, he sees several Wraith soldiers beam onto the ship. None face him. Ronon draws his gun and backs into an alcove, watching them march away. He heads down another corridor.]

(blankly)<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're under attack. We gotta get you to the armory and get you a gun. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[He drags her away. The computer monitor beeps that the experiment is complete.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The unconscious Marks is dragged off of his seat by a Wraith. The rest of the bridge crew is laid out in the back area by the star chart. Wraith study the systems at various consoles while Todd activates the lockout protocol.]

<blockquote>RONON<br />
Augh! Locked!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller turns to find the door sealing behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />

</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Ten minutes and counting. Still no problem.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stares at the schematic diagram on the monitor and looks concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh boy&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(worried)<br />
What? What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think I just found a log entry that tells us what the side effect is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
It's not&#8230;harmful radiation, is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel steps back from the console and clutches his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, no, no. You and I are safe. It's the rest of the galaxy that's gonna have problems, including&#8230;Atlantis. I've got to shut this thing down.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts frantically working the controls. The door opens and two aliens enter, aiming their weapons at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALIEN<br />
Step away from the device.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay continues to work the controls. One alien shoots him and he slumps to the floor. Daniel raises his hand in surrender.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Okay. Wait-wait-wait-wait! Look, there's a very dangerous, very serious problem with the device. Now, we need to talk to your boss&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The other alien shoots Daniel, and he collapses unconscious.]

</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. All set. So, I'll have Chuck dial M5R-179. You should be able to contact the <i>Daedalus</i> via subspace once you get there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nice work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Thanks. Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thanks. We're gonna need it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right. Dial it up.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck nods and dials the Stargate. The Stargate activates. There is an alarm buzzing Zelenka notices as he stares at his computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(puzzled)<br />
What's that? You see that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
We've got a power spike at the event horizon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What? Power is building within the 'gate?! No, no, no, no. See, that-that can't happen.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel, do not lower the jumper into the Gate Room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, for some reason, there is an unprecedented power buildup within the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches from the control room to the jumper.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Power build up from where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's coming from within the event horizon. Oh no. This is very, very bad for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just shut it down. It's probably a faulty 'gate at the other end.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I-I-I'm trying. It won't let me!</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to Chuck, who shakes his head negatively.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I'm coming down.</blockquote>
<p>[Every gets up and follows Sheppard out of the jumper. They clamber down the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do we do? Wait thirty-eight minutes and ride the puddle out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I wish. If the power continues to build like this, the 'gate will reach critical overload and most certainly explode.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Explode?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. I told you it was very, very bad for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How does something like this happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I don't know. It's never happened before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How long do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Not very long at all. About ninety seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ninety seconds?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
I would say closer to sixty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've got to evacuate everyone in the tower!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The 'gate exploding is the equivalent of a dozen nuclear explosions. There-there's nowhere we could evacuate quickly enough to a safe distance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The-the-the shield!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Collapse the city's shield around the 'gate. We can contain the explosion!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, yes! That just might work!</blockquote>
<p>[He rolls to another console and starts typing.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
The 'gate will reach a critical limit in five&#8230;four&#8230;three&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The shield starts forming around the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
&#8230;two&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The shield makes a complete dome around the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
&#8230;one&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate explodes, contained in the shield. It creates a bright light like a small sun in the gate room. Everyone shields their eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Don't look at the blast!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(caustic)<br />
Might have mentioned that before!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'll see if I can divert more power to the shield. See if I can block more of the radiation.</blockquote>
<p>[The light lessens, but the blast is still powerful, undulating within the limits of the shield. Sheppard and Teyla look at the area and walk towards the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And now what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The shield continues to diffuse the energy of the blast. Every second it is contained within the shield, the explosion gets weaker.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How long does it take?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka's computer beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stepping back towards Zelenka)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The shield needs at least another minute to contain the full brunt of the blast, but we're frying out the emitters. I don't know how much longer I can hold this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shut down the city! Transfer all the power!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, I'm trying.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka types on his laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shouting)<br />
Everyone who doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city! Move! Everybody!</blockquote>
<p>[The gate room personnel quickly evacuate. Sheppard points to Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're gonna want to get out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John, I&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sharply)<br />
Teyla, please.</blockquote>
<p>[With a torn expression, Teyla complies. Only Zelenka and Sheppard are left.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on. You can do it, Radek.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks to the explosion. The bright yellow has dulled to a darker orange for the most part.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(encouraged)<br />
It's going down. We're going to make it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
No. It's not enough.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at Zelenka's screen.]
