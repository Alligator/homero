<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Banks is at her station. Woolsey and Sheppard are nearby. The Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Incoming wormhole. Signal's coming in now.</blockquote>
<p>[They look on a monitor to see a video transmission of the Wraith known as Todd standing outdoors on a planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(taken aback)<br />
Todd.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(on video)<br />
No doubt you're surprised to see me, John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances back at Woolsey for a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you weren't looking so good last time I saw you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Yes. Well, you'll be pleased to know the treatment was successful&#8212;although excruciatingly painful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're just saying that to make me feel good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(chuckling)<br />
I was able to return to my position as leader of the alliance, although&#8230;I have had a recent setback. Perhaps you can see what is remaining of my shuttle behind me?</blockquote>
<p>[Todd steps back and in the distance the remains of a crashed Wraith ship lie in the desert.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Yeah, nice landing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Don't be so critical, Sheppard. It wasn't long ago my flying skills saved the lives of both you and your companions. It wasn't pilot error. I was attacked&#8230;by one of my underlings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You'll excuse me for being blunt, but why should we care?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
It isn't the fact that he attacked and at least temporarily defeated me that should concern you. It is rather&#8230;how he managed to do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
And how was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Well, he acquired a rare and powerful piece of technology&#8212; one with which I believe you are quite familiar&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey and Sheppard's team congregate in McKay's lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A ZPM? Are you kidding me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eh, that's what he said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't buy it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, for one thing, they don't exactly grow on trees.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He got betrayed by one of his own people. Now he wants us to help him clean up the mess. End of story.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is possible that he mentioned the zero point module simply to get our attention.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Except he would also have to know that sooner or later we would discover the truth, and in the meantime, he's volunteered to place himself in our custody. Not a very good plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you can bet there's something he's not telling us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Granted. But that doesn't necessarily mean that he's lying about the ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
If this true, it could be very, very bad. I mean, inefficient power generation is the Achilles heel of Wraith technology. It's basically the reason for every technological advantage we have. If this&#8230;underling, or whatever it is that Todd calls him, is flying around in a ZPM powered hiveship, then&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It's a threat we can't tolerate. And we won't.</blockquote>
<p>[He nods to Sheppard, who sighs and exchanges concerned looks with McKay.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INTERROGATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey enters the room. Todd already sits at a table, his hands resting on top of it.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well&#8230;here we are again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Indeed. The city has become quite familiar to me&#8230;almost a respite from daily life. It would be a shame to see it destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Are you suggesting that if we don't help you, that would be a likely outcome?</blockquote>
<p>[Todd shrugs. Woolsey sits at the table across from him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
All right. Let's start at the beginning. Where did the ZPM come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You recall I managed to acquire a few of the devices from the Replicator city before it was destroyed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Yes, and they were lost when Colonel Sheppard took out the cloning facility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Not all of them. I may have acquired a few more than I let on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(shrewdly)<br />
How many more?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Let's not get caught up in unnecessary details.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(firmly)<br />
I like details.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Even if I gave you a number, you'd have no way of verifying it. So what's the point?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
All right, then tell me this. Why now? You've had those ZPMs for over a year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
The organic nature of the hive creates certain incompatibilities with Ancient technology. I put my best scientists to work on this project, and recently one of them succeeded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Only he didn't want to turn it over to you. He decided he wanted to keep it for himself. And now you want us to help you kick him to the curb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(becoming serious and intense)<br />
What you really need to know is that this hive is a work in progress. It has yet to reach its full potential, which means if you attack it now, you may be able to destroy it. But if you hesitate, it will be too late, and this hive will be unstoppable.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey grinds his jaw.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIG</b>
</p><p>[Todd sits on a cot. He is wearing a plain grey coverall. Sheppard enters. There are guards outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looking good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Was it really necessary to remove my subspace transmitter and force me to wear this <i>ridiculous</i> outfit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, after what happened last time on this ship, you can't blame us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I take it that my request to be on the bridge when we make contact&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Denied.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(nodding)<br />
Understandable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Here's the problem. Every time we get involved with you, I feel like I'm walking around with a live grenade in my pocket, just waiting for it to all go wrong&#8212;for that one "thing" you forgot to mention.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I assure you, in this case&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(cutting him off)<br />
Save it. Been down this road before.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
If you really feel that way, why would you let me go after our last encounter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We had a deal, and you kept up your end of the bargain. And to be honest, I didn't think you'd live.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(understanding)<br />
Ahh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quietly serious)<br />
If I find out you're playing us, I'm not gonna wait for authorization. There isn't gonna be any paperwork. I'm just gonna kill you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns and leaves as Todd watches, intrigued.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team is geared up for an away mission as the members enter the bridge and approach Caldwell.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's the status, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We're approaching the coordinates. You going somewhere?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Drop us out early before we get into sensor range. We'll check it out in the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
That's not the plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can go in cloaked. Stay in touch through subspace on a secure channel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If it's what Todd says it is, you can come in guns blazing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All right. Just be careful.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies through space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team is inside. McKay studies readings on the cockpit displays.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Almost in range.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Engaging cloak.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard touches some controls, and the cloak engages.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, getting readings now. It's a hive, all right. Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm reading&#8230;a higher than normal energy output. I mean, significantly higher.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Consistent with the ZPM?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's hard to say from this far out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, what's your status?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
McKay's getting some interesting readings, so we're going in for a closer look.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship is visible through the jumper window.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm detecting massive energy output.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disturbed)<br />
It's growing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's what they're doing with the surplus energy&#8212;using it to grow a larger, and if I'm reading this correctly, significantly denser outer hull. It makes sense. Normal hives have a limit of growth. I mean, any bigger or heavier and they become impossible to maneuver, let alone get into hyperspace. I mean, you make a simple left turn, and you're torn apart by your own inertia. But with a ZPM&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I get the picture. What does that mean for us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When they're done, my guess is that hull will be all but impenetrable.</blockquote>
<p>[The team look worried.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Well, we better take 'em out of the picture before they get that far.</blockquote>
<p>[A sensor beeps rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hold on. They're&#8230;powering weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They can't see us, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course not. They must just be running a test&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[An energy pulse heads straight for them, passing directly overhead, shaking the jumper. Everyone's eyes widen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Holy crap!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what are the odds of them randomly firing a test shot directly at us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I would say&#8212;given the enormity of empty space all around us&#8212;nonexistent?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low)<br />
They can see us.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard steers the jumper away from the hive ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They must've figured out a way to increase the sensitivity of their scanners.</blockquote>
<p>[Another blast is a near-miss, rattling the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustic)<br />
Let me guess, something to do with the ZPM?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Probably.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, we've got a problem. Our cloak's ineffective.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're on our way.<br />
(to port helmsman)<br />
Take us in maximum sublight.<br />
(to Marks)<br />
Shields up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> flies forward.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Another blast hits too close.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm dropping the cloak. It ain't doing us any good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not to mention you could fire back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(admonishing)<br />
One thing at a time, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper moves evasively and dodges several pulse blasts. It gets struck in one of its nacelles and starts spinning out of control around its longitudinal axis.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're hit!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've lost controls!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay jumps up and heads towards the rear compartment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll work out a bypass. Give me a minute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They get a bead on us, Rodney, we're dead!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens a panel and starts working with the crystals.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper continues to spin out of control as it gets close to <i>Daedalus</i>. Another pulse barely misses it. Further blasts are deflected by the <i>Daedalus</i> shields as it flies into the path of fire.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
It worked, sir. We've blocked the shot. Shield is holding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All right, now return fire. Main battery, full power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> fires back at the hive ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Direct hit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Damage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
(surprised)<br />
Minimal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Ready missiles. We're gonna throw everything we have at this guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Sir, I'm reading a massive energy buildup.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship sends out a large series of pulse blasts from every weapons port along its flank. All are directed at <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Brace for impact!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Several of the pulses strike the <i>Daedalus</i>, battering the shield at the bow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sparks fly as the ship takes damage.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Shields are down! Heavy damage on all decks! We've lost hyperdrive and main weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Evasive maneuvers! We can't take another hit like that!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay stops working on the ceiling control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you should have flight controls now!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard begins to move the craft.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about weapons?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not a chance!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla has been watching the window.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Something's happening.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay steps forward as they all lean to look.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive passes the <i>Daedalus</i> and jumps into hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> GEAR UP ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell meets with Sheppard's team as they take off their tactical equipment. Outside, work teams try and repair damage to the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You know, it doesn't make any sense. Most of our main systems were down. These guys had us dead to rights, and they knew it. Why would they just fly away?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps it's precisely because they knew we were no longer a threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
But it's not like the Wraith to be so charitable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Todd said the ship isn't finished, right? They haven't adapted the full potential of the ZPM. Well, maybe the battle maxed them out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, if that's the case, I'd hate to meet up with them when they <i>do</i> finish it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard finishes unloading his pistol and sets it on the gear table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We need to get back to Atlantis. What's the prognosis on the hyperdrive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Uh, the control systems are completely shot. My guys are working on a patch, but it could be days, even weeks before we're back online. For the moment, we're not going anywhere.</blockquote>
<p>[Marks enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
(to Caldwell)<br />
Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What is it, Marks?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
I think we may have something.</blockquote>
<p>[Marks leads the way out of the room. Caldwell and Sheppard's team follow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Kavanaugh is amongst the crew working in the room. Caldwell and Sheppard's team enter and surround his station. He glances back, spots McKay, rolls his eyes and turns back to work.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Kavanaugh? What the hell are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Reassignment. More fun and adventure in the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(irritated)<br />
Show us what you got, please?</blockquote>
<p>[Kavanaugh moves to another station. They follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
It's a subspace signal. We detected it just before the hive jumped into hyperspace. It was weak. Luckily, I happened to be monitoring the sensor, or we might not have picked it up at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(studying the readout)<br />
It's Wraith code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
(irked)<br />
Obviously. We're having trouble deciphering it because the message is interlaced with a residual radiation, and I've never seen it before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have. Once, when we met another me, and once when we encountered another <i>Daedalus</i>. This signal was sent from another reality.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Uh, I'm sorry. What the hell are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Some Wraith, somewhere, in another reality sent a coded signal&#8212;only whatever means they used to access subspace created a rift, allowing the signal to cross into multiple realities, including our own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So what does it say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, just give me a second.</blockquote>
<p>[He leans across Kavanaugh's station and starts typing. He pulls up a new readout.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing in despair)<br />
Oh, great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a set of coordinates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Coordinates to what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Earth.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange worried looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Sheppard, and Caldwell move through a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think the hive picked up the signal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why else would they leave like that? It can't be a coincidence. The Wraith know that Earth is a much richer feeding ground than anything in the Pegasus Galaxy, and they've been looking for those coordinates for years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All right. As soon as communications are back up, we'll contact Atlantis, have them relay a message to Stargate Command.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a minute. I've got an idea. How many ships do we have available?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Aside from ourselves, there's the <i>Apollo</i> and the <i>Sun Tzu</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How about the <i>Odyssey</i>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Mmm, it's on some secret mission even I'm not supposed to know about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then two will have to be enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you suggesting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, that hive may be super-powerful and all, but I'll bet it has to drop out of hyperspace at some point along the way for hull regeneration. I can use the sensor data from the jumpers to extrapolate exactly where that'll be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Sounds pretty risky. If you're wrong, it&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(interrupting)<br />
I won't be! Anyways, we can't wait until they get all the way to Earth. My guess is by that point, they'll be fully adapted to the ZPM.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Chuck is at his usual station. Woolsey works with another technician nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Sir? The <i>Daedalus</i> just dropped out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It's about time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Colonel Sheppard and his team are beaming down.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team beams directly into the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Colonel. It's good to finally have you all back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What'd we miss?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well the good news is, there's no indication of any other Wraith ships heading for the Milky Way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's as I figured. That signal was too short and too weak. That ship only detected it because of its obvious improvements to the sensors.</blockquote>

(staticy, on video)<br />
We've engaged the hive, unfortunately, without much success. The <i>Sun Tzu</i> was crippled, and she's venting atmosphere. We're in the process of taking on her crew now. But unfortunately, with my engines down, I won't be able to get to the nearest Stargate for at least a month.

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, Teyla, McKay, and Lorne are geared up and waiting at the outgoing wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Think that cleared the way?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon unholsters his gun and strides towards the event horizon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
There's one way to find out.</blockquote>
<p>[He enters the wormhole without hesitation. The others follow as Woolsey looks on from the control room balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
The guards at the 'gate have been neutralized. We're moving on.</blockquote>
<p>[The wormhole shuts down. Woolsey turns to Zelenka, who's standing nearby. They walk towards Woolsey's office.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(despondent)<br />
I should've sent more marines with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
A full scale assault wouldn't have accomplished anything. If they're going to sabotage key systems on that hive, they're going to need speed and stealth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Maybe. I just hate being stuck out here in the middle of nowhere and not able to do anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Actually, that's something I've been wanting to talk to you about.</blockquote>
<p>[They stop walking.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(referring to the computer he's holding)<br />
This is something that Rodney's been working on for quite some time. It's an adaptation of an Ancient technology which was abandoned because of instability and&#8230;enormous power requirements.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Wormhole drive. It-it's nearly instantaneous travel across enormous distances. It's not unlike gate travel itself. If it works, it could have us at Earth in a matter of seconds. Now, the calculations are incredibly complex. If we're off even by a fraction&#8230;it could be very bad.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE, EARTH ORBIT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's powered down F-302 floats in Earth orbit. He starts to power up systems.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right. I'd say it's time to get moving.</blockquote>
<p>[He powers up the engines and flies away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon leads the team as they head warily through the corridors. McKay studies his scanner. Ronon spots a patrol of Wraith heading towards them.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<p>[They scatter for cover and begin a firefight with Wraith, staying behind various ship structures.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(over gunfire)<br />
Is there another way around?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over gunfire, looking at scanner)<br />
I think so!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Go! Go! Go!</blockquote>
<p>[She and Lorne provide cover fire as the others fall back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This way!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Ronon start down another corridor. Ronon cautiously turns a corner, but is ambushed by a Wraith who knocks his gun away and fights him hand-to-hand. McKay raises his gun but can't get a clear shot. He's ambushed from behind by another Wraith who disarms him. Ronon still struggles with his guard as the other Wraith tries to get his feeding hand through McKay's layers of tactical equipment and clothing. Teyla and Lorne fight a separate gun battle.]
</p><p>[Ronon finally gets the upper hand by using the Wraith's stunner as a blunt weapon, hitting the soldier multiple times and knocking it back. Ronon then strikes the one holding McKay, pulling it back by using the stunner in a choke hold, finally defeating him. The warrior Ronon originally fought pulls a dagger from its boot and stabs Ronon in the back. Ronon screams in agony as McKay watches helplessly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's F-302 fires a missile into the dart bay, blasting a hole open just before flying through the hole into the ship. Once inside, it maneuvers its way into the inner sections of the vessel.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla arrives, shooting the remaining Wraith. On the floor, Ronon pants and feels his back for the wound as McKay rushes to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rushes over. Lorne also arrives and continues to provide cover fire for them. Teyla crouches next to Ronon by McKay. Ronon's mouth is filling with blood.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is it bad?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They hit his lung! He's bleeding out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(between pained breaths)<br />
Just go&#8230;Just go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No! We are not leaving without you!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks at her, then dies, his eyes remaining open.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon?! RONON!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pants in disbelief. More Wraith arrive, and Teyla immediately opens fire on them, McKay covering his ears from the percussion of noise. Lorne clears the way behind them then goes to help Teyla. He pulls her away from Ronon's body.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Come on, we gotta get out of here now! Let's go!</blockquote>
<p>[He drags McKay up and provides cover fire as they run away.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go!</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

<p>[Carter sighs.]

Stargate Command, this is Sheppard. Come in&#8230;.Look, I don't have much time before this place is swarming with Wraith, so&#8230;I'm arming the nuke.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne and Teyla stop firing and look at each other and McKay in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
What? Did he say "nuke"?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Just do me a favor, when Atlantis shows up&#8230;tell 'em I said goodbye.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne hands McKay his sidearm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard! This is McKay! Look, stop what you're doing now!</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the corridor and the F-302.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(confused)<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, it's me! I've got Lorne! I've got Teyla! We're on board the hive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?! Wha&#8212;how?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rushed)<br />
Look, it's a long story&#8230;just&#8230;important thing is, if you're about to do what I think you're gonna do, don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This hive is about to attack Earth, Rodney. I don't have much of a choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, just wait. We'll come to you. I'm sure I can rig up some kind of a&#8230;remote detonator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What good's that gonna do for us? We can't get off this ship, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's where you're wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[He checks his scanner, then gestures to Lorne and Teyla, his sidearm at ready.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This way.</blockquote>
<p>[They head out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey enters, approaching Keller, who is looking over charts with a nurse. She sees him and steps away from the nurse.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Keller. I wanted to let you know that we're about to fire up the wormhole drive. If it works, we could find ourselves in the middle of a combat situation rather suddenly. You and your staff need to be ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(taken aback)<br />
And-and if it doesn't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
From what I'm told, the city would be&#8230;instantly vaporized.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller stares at him in wide-eyed shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(weakly, then stronger)<br />
Oh&#8230;okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey walks away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP, OUTSIDE LANDING PLATFORM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard hides by a pillar just outside where his F-302 is parked. A console is nearby. He braces himself then spins, weapon ready, to confront anything on the other side. Lorne, Teyla, and McKay are there, their own weapons at ready, the weapon flashlights shining at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(relieved)<br />
You guys are the last people I expected to see on this ship.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay runs into the landing bay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Same here. Gimme a minute.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts working on his computer by the aircraft.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla Teyla stares at Sheppard in shock and grief and doesn't answer. Lorne looks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla, where's Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla slowly shakes her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(quietly)<br />
I'm sorry, John.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at her, stricken by the news.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon comes to life dramatically with a pained breath. The Wraith known as Kenny has its feeding hand on Ronon's chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ah. Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[He pants, looking around in shock. Kenny removes his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
I restored your life, human, and bound your wound.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon groans, looking around frantically.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(drily)<br />
That was real nice of you.</blockquote>

<p>[Kenny stands.]

They'll target military installations first, then the power grid. Send the population into a panic. Then, they'll launch the darts.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
How many humans are on my ship?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon says nothing. Kenny grinds the heel of his boot around Ronon's wound. Ronon can't prevent a pained cry.]
</p>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
Where are they?!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon snarls in defiance. Weapons fire strikes Kenny and his guards. Ronon looks over in surprise to see his teammates, including Sheppard, arrive. They look equally shocked to see him alive. Teyla and Sheppard help Ronon to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How ya doin', Chewie?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(standing with pained grunt)<br />
Ow. Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

We got Ronon. We're headed to the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Five minutes to get there, five minutes to recalibrate the DHD for local coordinates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ten minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
I'm sorry. The hive is powering weapons. We're out of time.</blockquote>
<p>[The team pauses in the corridor and they exchange stricken looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Understood.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Give me the detonator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(desperate)<br />
Yeah&#8230;but we're almost there. I mean&#8230;look, did I say five minutes to recalibrate the DHD? I meant two minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He holds out his hand. McKay enters some commands and resignedly hands it over. Everyone exchanges looks. Sheppard takes a breath and readies the detonation.]

Of course!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rubs Ronon's shoulder comfortingly as he steps up next to her.]

<p>[They all stare at the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco, California and into the bay beyond it.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(cautiously)<br />
No one can see us, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
We managed to activate the cloak before we came in too close. This entire area is under naval quarantine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, so this is where everyone went, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nudges McKay, who's looking at the view with a pensive expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(drily)<br />
I'm alive.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller snickers. McKay puts his arm around her, pulling her close.]
