<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Excerpts from 5.10 "First Contact" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>END EXCERPTS</b>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla steps out of a transporter.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Move quickly! We have to get everyone to the lower levels of the tower to make sure that everyone will be&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[An explosion rocks the corridor.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS TOWER</b>
</p><p>[The Gate Room area of the tower explodes, blowing out the windows. Smoke curls through the broken windows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The power goes out. People hurry, speaking in scared mutterings.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio, worried)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, are you all right? John?!</blockquote>
<p>[Marie approaches Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Teyla, how many were up there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
I'll go get my people.</blockquote>
<p>[Marie races off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The only light is from sunlight in the broken window and flashlights carried by Teyla and the search and rescue team. The area is scorched and blackened; the Stargate is gone.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Debris still falls and sparks fly across short circuits. The room is unrecognizable.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John?! They were right here when I left them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
If the explosion was hot enough, there might not be anything left for us to find.</blockquote>
<p>[In the distance can be heard a weak groan.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Did you hear that?</blockquote>
<p>[Marie nods. The groan is louder and seems to be coming from Woolsey's office.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard has bodily covered Zelenka as they both lie prone on the floor. Shards of glass cover the room, including Sheppard. Teyla and Marie rush in with the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(groaning, confused)<br />
We need to take cover.</blockquote>
<p>[Marie and Teyla help him up.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Huhn?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(louder)<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My ears&#8230;I think I got some glass in my back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Marie&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Marie leads the stiff Sheppard away. Teyla crouches down by Zelenka, who's starting to move.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We lost the Stargate. We lost the control room. That's bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But we did not lose you. That's good.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods to another member of the rescue team.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[The man helps Teyla lead Zelenka away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> floats near Todd's hive ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits propped against a bulkhead, unconscious. Todd sits in the commander's chair. Kenny enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
All the troops you've requested have beamed on board.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Have them round up the rest of the humans and confine them to one of the hangar bays.</blockquote>
<p>[Another Wraith nods and does as Todd bids, leading a troop of soldier Wraith out.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Inform our hive to wait for us here. And under no circumstances are they to activate their hyperdrive. Is that understood?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
Yes. Where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Power is on in this area. Marie picks several small shards of glass out of Sheppard's back with forceps. Sheppard grunts in pain. Teyla approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
I need you to get Banks and her team to set up an auxiliary control room below the damaged areas.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(nodding)<br />
They've already begun. How are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ach! Well, I'm alive. You know, that's good for now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I still do not understand what happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The 'gate blew up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(drily)<br />
That much I surmised. But why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
I don't know. Where the hell's McKay when you need him, huh?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANCIENT FACILITY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The center of the facility is lit up in a blue glow from the active Attero device.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT SEALED ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Daniel sits, leaning against a wall in their latest makeshift prison cell. McKay paces nervously in front of him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, so the device creates a very specific subspace "turbulence" that makes it impossible for the Wraith to operate their hyperdrives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(resigned)<br />
You said that already.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But there's a side-effect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, the unforeseen one that Janus mentions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, it's certainly not "seen" here, because there's no Stargate on this planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(aggravated)<br />
What's the point, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, although the subspace turbulence only affects the Wraith's hyperdrive systems, it creates a very dangerous type of radiation that, uh, well&#8230;that messes with the basic operation of the Stargates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(alert)<br />
<i>Stargates</i>? What, as in all of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, all of the Stargates in the Pegasus network, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
And when you say "messes with," you mean what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, when dialed, power will build up inside the 'gate until it overloads.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
So, you're saying that as long as this Janus device is running, every time someone dials a 'gate in the entire galaxy&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It'll explode. I mean, millions of people will die if we don't shut that thing down.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange very worried looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey awakens to find Todd hovering over him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Good timing, Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith soldier drags him to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(with bravado)<br />
Look, I don't know what it is you think we've done, but I assure you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(to Kenny)<br />
Take us out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
We haven't arrived in Atlantis yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(shocked)<br />
Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
We're within communications range. We don't want to get too close. Take us out.<br />
(to Woolsey)<br />
I was hoping you'd be awake for this.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and Banks's team have set up computers on tables and are bringing in more equipment. Power is restored to this area. Sheppard and Teyla enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, are we up and running?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Yes, sir. We've routed all the city's main controls into this room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
At least we're not blind anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, but we're severely crippled. And without the 'gate or the ability to reach the <i>Daedalus</i>, we have no way of getting to M6H-987 or rescuing Rodney and Doctor Jackson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What should we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(loudly)<br />
Five bucks to anybody who can figure out how to contact the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[Banks sits at her laptop. It blinks an alert.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Uh, Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You got an idea, Banks?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Well, no, but I am being hailed by the <i>Daedalus</i> on subspace. Does that count?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(surprised)<br />
Technically, that's not your idea, but good enough. Put 'em on screen.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Teyla move to the communications monitor. Sheppard taps Banks on the shoulder as he passes.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't worry, I'll pay you later.</blockquote>
<p>[They wait for screen to stop being static.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into videocom)<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>! It's good to, uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The image clears. They are shocked to find Todd on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell's going on? Where's Caldwell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I'm afraid I had to relieve him and his crew of duty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, to Zelenka)<br />
How close are they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(low, to Sheppard)<br />
Not close enough to go by jumper, if that's what you're thinking.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the </i>Daedalus<i> bridge and Atlantis.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Don't worry. I'm more than willing to return this ship and its crew to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(suspicious)<br />
In exchange for what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
You've activated the Attero Device. I need you to shut it down and give me its location immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know what you're talking about!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
It was very clever of you, luring me and my ship out into the open so you could see for yourself if it worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If what worked?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed. I was there ten thousand years ago when the Ancients first tried to use it, but they didn't have the stomach to leave it on once they realized how many of their precious Stargates it would destroy&#8230;how many humans it would kill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(low, to Sheppard)<br />
Sounds like something Janus would've worked on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Give me the location of the Attero device, and once I have destroyed it I will return this crew to you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, it's not what you think. We have nothing to do with this!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Every minute that goes by without you telling me where this device is, I will kill a member of your expedition.</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith soldier pulls Woolsey into view of the video camera. Teyla and Sheppard gasp.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Todd puts his arm around Woolsey in a falsely familiar pose. Woolsey looks nauseous and frightened.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Your time starts now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Give us a second.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives a signal to Banks, and the monitor on the <i>Daedalus</i> reads "transmission suspended."]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I don't think this should count toward the minute. I-I mean, he didn't say "no"&#8230;yet.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd slowly turns to Woolsey and growls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are the odds that&#8212;that&#8230;what's this thing called?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh&#8230;Attero device?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are the odds that this thing was at the other end of the subspace link that Rodney opened when he went to that lab?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
M6H-987? I'd say it's very likely. It's also very likely that's where he and Dr. Jackson were taken.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It must be a weapon that Janus developed during the Wraith war.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A weapon to blow up Stargates?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I doubt that was its original design. It doesn't seem like an effective strategy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, a nasty side effect. That's probably why they stopped production.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Whatever the aliens took from the lab allowed them to reactivate it again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whatever it is, Todd seems pretty keen to stop it&#8212;enough to risk taking the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but we can't give him the address. If he gets it, he'll destroy everything in his path, including Rodney and Doctor Jackson.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rubs his chin and sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(heaving a sigh)<br />
John, we don't have a choice. Our shield was able to take the brunt of the explosion, but if this is happening on other worlds, it could kill millions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(waving to Banks)<br />
Put him back on.</blockquote>
<p>[The video link is reestablished and the conversation again switches between the bridge of the ship and Atlantis.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(relieved)<br />
Oh, thank God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not the ones behind this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd turns to Woolsey. A soldier holds him in place as he raises his hand to feed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
W-w-wait! Wait! I said we're not the ones behind this, but we may have what you need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Atlantis was attacked yesterday by a race we have not encountered before. It stole a piece of Ancient technology. We believe this could be a component to this&#8230;Attero device.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd's hand slowly moves to Woolsey's chest, where it clutches his lapel. Woolsey watches the proceedings with alarm.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We managed to track them. Swing by here, pick me up, I will take you there myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
And give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive with one of your drones? I think not.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd straightens his hand as if to feed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why would I do that? Right now, you're one of the few people in the galaxy with a ship capable of dealing with this problem.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd again embraces Woolsey in this falsely companionable manner.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
And I intend to keep it that way. John Sheppard, transmit the coordinates, or I will feed on Mister Woolsey before your eyes!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives Todd a shrewd look. Not taking his eyes off Todd, he turns his head towards Banks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(tightly)<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<p>[One of the <i>Daedalus</i> consoles blinks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KENNY<br />
We have it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
We'll be in touch.</blockquote>
<p>[The link is severed. Teyla, Sheppard, and Zelenka exchange concerned looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> enters hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon tries to force the doors open with his bare hands. Keller watches with her arms crossed as he groans.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You really think that's going to work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(groaning)<br />
You got a better idea?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We're on a spaceship. Those doors are designed to be airtight. That means something as tiny as air can't even get through. How do you think you will?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah&#8230;that's kinda my point.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon strains again, and this time his efforts are rewarded. The door opens. He turns back to Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(triumphant)<br />
See?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller's eyes widen in alarm as she spots the two Wraith in the corridor beyond.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[She crouches as Ronon ducks and spins, shooting the two soldiers.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(shaken)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right, come on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Wait. Wh-what's our plan? Where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're going to get to an access ladder. We head down two floors to the engineering rooms, then we cripple the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(surprised)<br />
You&#8230;know how to do all that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Watch and learn.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads the way.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Hyperspace window opening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Think Todd changed his mind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
He might have realized just how crippled we are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
We're being hailed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Put it up.</blockquote>
<p>[A woman appears on the video screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATANA<br />
My name is Katana Labrea. I'm a Traveler. Larrin sent me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, is everything all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATANA<br />
No. As a matter of fact, it's not. Larrin was hoping you could tell us why the Stargates are blowing up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT SEALED ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay studies the panels on the wall, trying to figure out how to open one. The door to the room opens and one of the armored aliens walks in. He points at Daniel.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALIEN<br />
You. Come with me.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel points at himself, surprised.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Me? Why?</blockquote>
<p>[The alien unholsters his stunner. Daniel and McKay immediately raise their hands in surrender, McKay stepping in the line of fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa! We'll both go! No need for that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALIEN<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />
Well&#8230;I guess it&#8230;just must be your turn to use the fitness room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel walks past McKay, keeping his arms raised.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(with false brightness)<br />
You too.</blockquote>
<p>[He steps out of the room at gunpoint.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Katana has joined the Lantians.]
</p>
<blockquote>KATANA<br />
It was the first colony we'd built on the surface of a planet in a hundred generations, and it was leveled in an instant. I was in orbit when it happened. We could see the explosion from space. I've never witnessed anything that powerful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Mmm. The 'gates are made of naquadah, and when they become unstable, the size of the explosion is unimaginable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATANA<br />
We lost three thousand people and two ships, including our Ancient vessel. Larrin would've come herself, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, I'm sure she's got her hands full. Look, these aliens or whoever they are, they have two of our people hostage. They need to be stopped. We have coordinates but&#8230;we have no ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KATANA<br />
Then I guess I got here just in time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what I wanted to hear. Zelenka, you're with me.</blockquote>
<p>[He, Katana, and Zelenka start to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(protesting)<br />
John&#8230;!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla, I need you to stay here, all right? The second Todd's done, there's nothing stopping him from turning that ship around and making a run at Atlantis. I need someone I trust to stay in charge here.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[They leave. Teyla looks worried and frustrated.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p><p>[The door to engineering opens. Before the Wraith in the room can react, Ronon shoots them both. He enters. Keller follows, closing the door behind them and pressing buttons on the panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I locked the door.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This won't take long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So what do we do? Bring up the main control systems and disable them one by one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's one way to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe though. Otherwise they could just turn them back on again. Do you have&#8230;some sort of a pass-code to make sure they're locked out once and for all?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon opens up a panel under one of the consoles.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Nope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, then what are you thinking?</blockquote>

</p>

Okay, how long to get the device shut down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Five minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[They move to the console.]
</p>

All right, you look watch the&#8230;aw, come on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What? What now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, something must have spooked them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, aside from encrypting access to this workstation&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(dismissive)<br />
Yeah, but you can break that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, in a heartbeat. But as they very well know, you can't operate this machine without the control key. Look, the thing they stole from Janus's lab to begin with&#8230;</blockquote>

Todd let us take her back without so much as a fight. But he's locked us out of the controls and retreated to one of the 302 bays.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why the hell would he do that? He needs that place destroyed more than anyone.</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm beeps on Marks's console.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Mister Woolsey, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What is it, Marks?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Sir, the second we came out of hyperspace, a preprogrammed subroutine kicked in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Meaning?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Our main scanners located a facility on the planet and immediately locked the guidance system into it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It's taking us to the Attero device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
In a way&#8230;Sir, it's programmed a collision course.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey and Keller exchange worried looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That's how he's going to destroy the facility&#8230;by ramming us into it.</blockquote>

Can't we just power down the entire facility?</blockquote>

We can't do much more than turn the lights off and on without the component thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, we have to do something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(inspired)<br />
Wait a second&#8230;these suits were designed to protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Technically&#8230;yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then I have a really terrible idea.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks to the shielded chamber. Daniel follows him.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Oh, no. No. You're not thinking what I think you're thinking. The radiation in there would be pretty extreme.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly, but&#8230;Yeah, the antenna has a control crystal. If we can pull it manually&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I'd say fifty-fifty we even get that far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'd go thirty-seventy. But I don't have a better idea, and the suits&#8230;they should protect us.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We disabled the ship weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You did?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, Ronon did, yeah. They didn't have any other choice. Ramming the facility with the ship is the only sure-fire way to take it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Killing all of us in the process.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't think that he's that worried about us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
They just depressurized the 302 bay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Let's just get this over with.</blockquote>
<p>[They don their helmets.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, we both don't have to go in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, when you get killed by one of those discharges, someone's going to have to finish the job, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(drily)<br />
Oh. Great pep talk. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATTERO DEVICE SHIELDED CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[The door to the chamber opens and McKay and Daniel step inside. McKay points to the lightening arcs flying randomly through the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(nodding)<br />
Thanks, coach.</blockquote>
<p>[From the inside of the helmet, Daniel can see the room through the visor as well as get read-outs on several items via a overlay display, including McKay's presence. They reach the device itself. McKay crouches and pulls open the panel underneath the device. He pauses, studying the crystals.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What are you waiting for?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies his readouts of the crystals in his own helmet.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have to pull the right one, or the antenna explodes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(with nervous impatience)<br />
Well, hurry up.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel moves closer to the device, using its pillar as a lightening rod to deflect the arcs from being attracted to him.]
