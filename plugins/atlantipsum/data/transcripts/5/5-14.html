<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits at his desk. Ronon enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You wanted to see me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
May I ask why you have not filed a single mission report since I assumed command of this base?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
'Cause I haven't given you any?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
As you know, one of the changes I made around here is to require every team member to file mission reports, as opposed to only team leaders and science officers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(drily)<br />
Really? I didn't&#8212;I didn't know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I announced it my fourth day here, at an away team orientation meeting, detailing changes to mission protocol.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Was I there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(sighing, trying to stay patient)<br />
Yes, it was mandatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Because, I&#8230;I don't remember.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(losing patience)<br />
I saw you there! It's kind of hard to miss you. Look, my point is, I want you to file a report <i>every</i> mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(pained)<br />
I'm not good at writing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I figured you might say that. Use this. It's a digital voice recorder. Speak into it, we'll plug it in, and your report will be automatically transcribed and filed with the others.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands the dictaphone to Ronon, who takes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm not good at talking, either.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey closes his eyes and sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, EAST PIER</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard race radio controlled toy cars down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mocking)<br />
Oh, I'm sorry. Too fast for you, buddy boy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nursing home just called, Rodney, and they want their scooter back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Scooter? That is a tri-cell lipo pack under my hood, son.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's red car forces McKay's yellow one into the wall, then passes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(unrepentant)<br />
Ooh, sorry. My bad.</blockquote>
<p>[The cars circle a barrel and start back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, yeah, I will trample you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or trip on your skirt.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shrieks as the cars pass under her feet where she suddenly appears, walking Torren around. Sheppard and McKay instantly shut the cars down and run to her side.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa! You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(scolding)<br />
I could have dropped him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry, we didn't know anyone was around. Sure you're all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come to think of it, what are you doing down here anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Trying to get Torren to sleep. I find that walking him is the best way to calm him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ooh, he's colicky, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor Keller says it is a phase that will pass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, don't worry about it. I was a colicky baby too. Just do what my mum did, which is let me cry myself to sleep. I'm no worse for it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Anyway&#8230;we usually take turns walking him, but Kanaan is away visiting our people for a few days.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances at the baby, keeping his distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I&#8230;I'd help you out, but it looks like you've got everything taken care of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Now, all I have to do is get him back to our quarters without waking him&#8230;or being run over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(contrite)<br />
Yeah, well, you know, we're done here. We're just&#8230;you know&#8230;finishing up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good night!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good night! Have&#8230;a good one!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla heaves an annoyed sigh and leaves. As soon as she's gone, Sheppard and McKay start up their cars again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(urging car)<br />
Go, go, go, go, go go, go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla lays Torren in his fur-lined crib.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS EAST PIER CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard walk down the corridor, carrying their cars and controllers. McKay studies his.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I must have put too much strain on the motor. Shaft needs a bushing lube.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shoots him a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[The lights suddenly go out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's that about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Beats me.<br />
(keying radio)<br />
Radek? Come in. Control room, it's Dr. McKay. We just lost power on the East Pier. What's going on?</blockquote>
<p>[There is no response. Sheppard and McKay exchange concerned looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS EAST PIER, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay step out onto the pier itself. The city is all darkened except for the control room area of the tower.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
That's strange. Lights are all out all over the city except the control room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Dr. Rodney McKay calling anyone in the control room. Please respond.</blockquote>
<p>[There is still no answer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Something's definitely not right.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The only power is still at the top of tower.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla has lit candles and tries the door controls to no effect.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into headset)<br />
Rodney, are you there? Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SUPPLY ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard scavenges the room for flashlights and walkie-talkie radios.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Personnel mill around, trying to figure out what to do.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everything's dead. There's no way of knowing what the hell's going on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right.<br />
(spotting marine)<br />
Hey, Rivers. Fan out, find as many marines as you can, work your way up to the central tower. If you run into Woolsey, let me know. Communications are down; we're on walkies.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay spots Zelenka walking towards them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Radek!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Rodney, what's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, you don't know either?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm on my way to the control tower. I tried to radio you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Power's out except for the central tower. Here.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands Zelenka a walkie-talkie.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I need you to go to the main power room instead. See if you reboot the system from there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. All right.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka heads out. McKay and Sheppard head in the other direction.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla's door opens. She turns, curious.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[Two darkened figures are there. One shoots her with a Wraith stunner. She collapses]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MAIN POWER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka tries to reset the main power circuits to no avail. He curses in Czech.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STAIRWELL, NEAR LEVEL 35</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay are climbing the metal staircases one after another.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over walkie)<br />
Rodney, do you read me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over walkie)<br />
Yeah, Radek. Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the power room and the stairwell.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I've tried to restart power. So far, absolutely no success.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(breathless from exertion)<br />
What about the ZPM?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I've checked it, as well as the naquadah generator. Neither are online. Someone must've disabled them from the control room.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pauses to catch his breath.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If that was the case, then they wouldn't have any power up there either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, not unless they're using an external power source.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, listen to me. I want you to do exactly the same thing. Initiate a temporary patch using an external power source&#8212;one of the auxiliary battery units.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but that won't be enough to power the entire city, not by a long shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't worry about that. Just get me enough juice to access the mainframe so we can figure out what the hell is going on up there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right. Whereabouts are you right now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think Level 36?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thirty-five.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, great. 35. Perfect. So just another 28 floors to go. And that's just this stairwell. Then we get to Level 63; got to cross over to an ancillary stairwell. Climb another four levels and that's just to access the Gate Room&#8230;ooh! You know, see if you can wrestle enough power to the transporters while you're at it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right, I'll try.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, LEVEL 63</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard reaches the level where other personnel mill around. McKay slowly brings up the rear. He is breathless and drenched in sweat. They head to the ancillary stairwell]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(finally catching up)<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This door leads to the Gate Room stairwell, right?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries the door but it's sealed closed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Well, maybe the-the door was already closed when we lost power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or sealed on purpose to keep people out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, you think someone's infiltrated Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over walkie)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into walkie)<br />
Talk to me.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MAIN POWER ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(into radio)<br />
I've initiated a temporary patch. I was able to route partial power to your lab.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LEVEL 63, NEAR ANCILLARY STAIRWELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into walkie)<br />
Well, what about the transporters?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over walkie)<br />
Still working on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into walkie)<br />
Yeah, well, let me know when you've got one online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go to your lab. Try to tap into the mainframe. I'll try the other stairwells. They're probably blocked, too, but who knows. Maybe there's another way up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[They split up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LEVEL 63, NEAR OTHER STAIRWELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard runs into Lorne, Rivers, and others trying to open another doorway with no success.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Colonel!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That one's sealed too?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Yeah, all the stairwell doors are. Been trying to find a way up to the Gate Room since the power went out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, so have we.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Any idea what's going on yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay's still working on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I guess we could blow the door with C-4.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we probably will, but we're not there yet. I need to know what we're up against before we go storming up there.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters the darkened office where McKay already works.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any luck?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not much. You're right, though. Someone's taken over Atlantis. Hacked into the mainframe. I'm having a hard time accessing several of the critical systems. And the ones I can access, you know, are read-only.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka enters, carrying a tablet computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
Hey, what're you&#8230;how'd you get up here so fast?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, I was able to get some of the, uh, transporters back online again.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the transporter on the Gate Room level?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(puzzled)<br />
Oh, sadly no. There's a lockout code in place on that one.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives a frustrated sigh, then snaps his fingers, inspired.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Surveillance cameras.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gets up and moves to a different terminal.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've got closed circuit feeds on the control room and the gate room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, that is, if you're not locked out of those as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're not critical systems. I should be able to access them if&#8230;got it.</blockquote>
<p>[An image of the Gate Room comes onto the monitor. A puddle jumper sits right beside the gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(puzzled)<br />
A puddle jumper?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shifts the feed to the view of the control room. A man with his back to them is working the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Who is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's definitely not Atlantis personnel.</blockquote>
<p>[A shadow crosses the screen heading towards Woolsey's office.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you get a feed on Woolsey's office?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, hang on.</blockquote>
<p>[He switches the feed again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh my god.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla is lying in one of the chairs. They watch on the monitor as she awakens and spots a swaddled Torren sleeping on a nearby chair. Teyla rushes to her baby. Another figure enters the room, recognizable in profile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is that&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla picks up Torren and spins to go. Her path is blocked by&#8230;]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Michael.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Hello, Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How did you get here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
The ship I borrowed from your people. It has provided me with a wealth of information and technology. And the key to infiltrating this base.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey speaks to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Use this. It's a digital voice recorder. Speak into it, we'll plug it in, and your report will be automatically transcribed and filed with the others.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands the dictaphone to Ronon, who takes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm not good at talking either.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey closes his eyes and sighs. The Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Unscheduled off-world activation.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey and Ronon enter the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Is the shield raised?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Yes, sir. Major&#8230;Nelson's IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
They're early. Not due back until tomorrow. All right, let them in.</blockquote>
<p>[The shield lowers and the jumper flies in. It parks itself on the Gate Room floor as the wormhole disengages.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
It's not going up to the jumper bay. What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major Nelson, what's your status?</blockquote>
<p>[The blue energy field forms around the puddle jumper. A whine begins to emit at an increasingly loud pitch.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(anxious)<br />
Get everybody out of here. Get 'em out now!</blockquote>
<p>[The field expands. As it crosses the control room, everyone collapses.]
</p><p>[The jumper's door opens, and Michael and his hybrids exit, heading up to the control room. They drag the unconscious personnel away. Michael takes a seat at a console.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Closing all immediate access doors.</blockquote>
<p>[Doors seal shut around the base.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
I've activated the portal's shield.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Good. What about the external power interface?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
We're connected. The control room level is now drawing power directly from the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Is the stun field holding?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
Yes. Two levels above and below us are protected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Now we can get to work.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Get to work on what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Forgive me. I forgot to congratulate you. What's his name?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla continues to hold the baby protectively and refuses to answer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
No matter. We don't have much time I'm afraid. My hybrids are preparing to activate Atlantis's self destruct device. As soon as they do that, we will leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You're going to destroy Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(bitter)<br />
A punishment richly deserved. Not that I expect you to agree with me. But don't worry, your baby will be safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are not taking my son!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Yes, Teyla. I am. You know how important your child is to me. His father and you have given him a powerful gift that I will utilize to exert greater control over my legion of hybrids. He is the key to increasing my strength, securing my reign over the galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Your "reign" is over. You will not make it out of here alive. My people will make certain of&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Michael storms forward, looming over Teyla. Torren fusses.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Enough! Enough. You think you've weakened me. You've destroyed my facilities, ruined much of my research. But you cannot&#8230;you can&#8230;not&#8230;weaken my resolve. Make no mistake, Teyla. I am as strong now as I have ever been. Look around you. I am in control of Atlantis. The very place where your people ended my life as I knew it. It is only fitting that I return&#8230;to extinguish this blight from the galaxy once and for all.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla breathes heavily, frightened.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and his team have joined the others. Sheppard is not there at the moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I thought Michael was dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
As did I.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I mean, we blew up his ship, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's the one who stole our jumper, used it to escape from his cruiser before we could destroy it. He's like a&#8230;a cockroach. You know, every time you try and step on him, he just skitters away.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks over, geared up with a rifle and tactical vest. He points to a schematic of the control tower on a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we need to get moving. Lorne, you and your team take this stairwell. My team will take this stairwell. We move into position. You wait for my mark to blast the door. We head up, retake the gate room. McKay you're with me. Zelenka, stay here, try to figure this thing out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Certainly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we're giving Michael no quarter. If you get a shot at him, take it. Make sure he's dead. Let's move.</blockquote>
<p>[The two teams head out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOUNGE, CONTROL TOWER</b>
</p><p>[Ronon wakes up to find himself on the floor amongst the control room personnel and Woolsey. All of the others are unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(groaning)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[He gets to his feet and tries the door. It doesn't open. Ronon feels for his gun, but it and his weapons belt are gone.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[One of the hybrids enters the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
(to Michael)<br />
I must speak with you.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael steps out of the room and they talk on the catwalk, still audible to Teyla even thought they are speaking low.]

Well, it's just&#8230;I'm&#8230;what you're about to do is&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with false levity)<br />
Yeah. It's not like it's the first time. How many suicide missions have I flown?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. I lost count.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, well, there you go&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well right, well, you know&#8230;here's to many more.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stands and puts out his hand. They exchange looks and Sheppard takes his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over walkie-talkie)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs, then pulls out his walkie-talkie from his pocket.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into walkie)<br />
Yeah, Radek, go ahead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over walkie)<br />
I've finally figured out how to override some of Michael's lockout codes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio, excited)<br />
That's great. Can you shut down the self-destruct?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, no, no. That will take a little bit more time. I have however, managed to get the access doors to the Gate Room open.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation continues to switch between the lab and the jumper.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that does us absolutely no good. I mean, th-the stun field is still in effect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the transporter on the Gate Room level?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Uh&#8230;no, no. I-I still don't have control of that either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
For crying out loud!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can. Michael has placed several highly encrypted codes&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, just&#8212;what about the gate shield? Can you lower it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(checking)<br />
Yes. That, I can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great.<br />
(to Sheppard, excited)<br />
You don't have to do your kamikaze run.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(surprised)<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you just have to fly up to the tower, get in proximity, dial the DHD to a random planet. We'll have Radek lower the gate shield, allowing the vortex to obliterate Michael's puddle jumper&#8230;or most of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now, that's a good plan.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're gonna fly it. That frees me up to lead the strike team.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stammers unintelligibly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You said it yourself; it's simple enough. You just dial the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dubious)<br />
I guess I can do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go easy on the accelerator.<br />
(into walkie talkie)<br />
Radek. get ready to drop that shield on my mark.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard runs out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay heads to the pilot's chair.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
We don't have much time. We need to leave this place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(into intercom)<br />
Time is short, Teyla. I don't understand&#8230;I would think the choice is an easy one. If nothing else, consider your child. By remaining in hiding, you are sentencing him to die. What kind of mother would do such a thing? He has the chance to live. Both of you do. Come with me, Teyla. Trust me&#8230;I will not harm either of you, and I will not harm Atlantis. You have my word.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ACCESS PANEL</b>
</p><p>[In the access panel, Teyla is upset, listening to Michael's offer. These last words seem to give her an idea.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Turn off the self-destruct system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ACCESS PANEL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into headset)<br />
You want me to trust you? Then show me you mean what you say. Turn off the self destruct system, and I will come with you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL PANEL</b>
</p><p>[Michael sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STAIRWELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's strike force heads up the stairwell.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[McKay's jumper flies up from underwater and slowly approaches the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into walkie talkie)<br />
All right, I'm in the air, approaching the central tower.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STAIRWELL</b>
</p><p>[The strike force pauses.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

Zelenka, you ready?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>

<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
(concerned)<br />
Less than two minutes. We need to go, now.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael ignores his minion.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(into intercom)<br />
Yes, Teyla. I hear you. You disappoint me. So I will leave you to the fate you have chosen. But I'm not leaving alone. You should know that I've already collected your son's DNA. Cloning him will require additional time, delay the implementation of my plan. But as you well know, I will not be deterred. Goodbye, Teyla.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to leave, with his hybrids following.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[As the hybrids head to the jumper, Michael pauses next to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>LEAD HYBRID<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Collecting one last prize.</blockquote>
<p>[He bends over Ronon, wielding a knife.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS TOWER</b>
</p><p>[The jumper hovers near the Gate Room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>

All right, Radek, drop the shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka types on his computer.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Michael leans down to cut Ronon's throat. He hears a noise behind him as the Stargate's shield lowers.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(into walkie-talkie)<br />
The shield's down. Go, Rodney!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate begins to dial.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
No!</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate activates, the kawhoosh obliterating 2/3 of the jumper, including the hybrids inside.]
</p><p>[A door opens and Sheppard's strike force rushes inside, exchanging fire with the remaining hybrids. Overwhelmed, the hybrids begin to fall.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla scrambles out of the access panel and runs, still carrying Torren.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(over walkie talkie)<br />
The stun field is neutralized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into walkie talkie)<br />
What about the self-destruct? Is it disabled?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between McKay's and Zelenka's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, yes. It shut off when the jumper's power was cut.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good. I'm heading back. Go ahead and reboot the city's power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. I'm already doing it.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The lights begin to come back on in the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Power is restored. Sheppard's team moves cautiously. One man is stunned. Sheppard spots Michael in the control room. Michael tries to stun him, but Sheppard has taken cover behind the jumper wreckage. He returns fire, wounding Michael in the shoulder. Michael runs away.]
</p><p>[Sheppard pauses as he gets to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get a medic!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard continues after Michael, who runs towards the jumper bay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into walkie-talkie)<br />
Close the jumper bay doors, Radek!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOUNGE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla runs to where the control room crew have been waiting.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Amelia! Will you take care of Torren for me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Banks takes the child from Teyla's arms.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Make sure no one leaves.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rushes out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Michael runs into the jumper bay, searching for a means of escape. He sees the bay doors of the ceiling closing. Sheppard enters and fires, but misses. Michael runs up to the top of the tower via a very long and shallow spiral staircase.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS TOWER, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Michael runs out to a small balcony surrounding the top of the tower. He sees no way out except the door he's just come through. Michael leans into the shadows as Sheppard appears in the doorway, P-90 at ready. Michael ambushes him, taking his gun and knocking him off the walkway.]
</p><p>[Sheppard struggles, falling to a lower awning and able to grab hold of a buttress before falling. He struggles and pulls himself back up to the lower awning. Michael jumps down to join him. They exchange blows. Michael gains the upper hand, knocking Sheppard on his back where Michael tries to choke him. Sheppard grabs at Michael's wounded shoulder, making Michael lose his grip. Sheppard throws Michael, but he again gains his balance and gets the upper hand. He knocks Sheppard against the metal buttress, stunning him and knocking him against the tower in a semi-consciousness fugue. Teyla joins the battle, catching Michael by surprise. She lands several blows, and Sheppard is able to strike back once as well. Their combined attacks knock Michael off the awning, but he is able to grab hold with both hands to the edge.]
</p><p>[Teyla looks down at Michael, studying him for several moments. She kicks Michael's hand, making him lose his grip.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Ah! Teyla!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares in surprise at Teyla but does nothing as Michael continues to hang by one hand. Teyla stares coldly down at Michael for several more moments, then kicks his other hand. Michael falls into the depths of the city. Teyla watches for a long moment as Sheppard sits behind her, stunned.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon lies on top of the covers and shifts restlessly on a bed. He is dressed in scrubs. Woolsey, wearing a sling on his right arm, approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How's Dr. Keller's most cantankerous patient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You gotta be kidding me. You get released, and I gotta stay here another day?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Because I only fell down a flight of stairs. You, my friend, were <i>hurled</i> from a much greater height. You're lucky you only suffered a concussion and didn't break your neck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(dismissive)<br />
It's nothing. I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I know you are, but listen to the doctor. Anyway, I just wanted to drop by and commend you for your exemplary work. Your courage in the face of danger continues to amaze, and&#8230;dare I say, inspire me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Get some rest. And don't worry, your team's not going anywhere without you.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey begins to walk away.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That reminds me&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey returns to his side.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I know Michael attacking the city isn't really a mission, but, uh&#8230;I filed a report anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(startled)<br />
Oh. Well. Splendid. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes the dictaphone from Ronon and heads out of the infirmary, clicking play.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(on tape)<br />
Mission report&#8230;.Michael invaded Atlantis&#8212;tried to blow it up. We stopped him. End of report.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey shakes his head with a rueful chuckle.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay renew their car race, setting up at the end of the corridor. Sheppard has a wound on his right cheek from the fight with Michael.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Take a good, long look. 'Cause soon you're gonna see nothing but tail lights.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nice try, Speed Racer.</blockquote>
<p>[They start their cars. McKay's takes an early lead.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ha ha ha!</blockquote>
<p>[At the far end, Teyla enters from a side corridor, carrying Torren. She smiles expectantly at seeing the toys. Sheppard and McKay quickly veer their cars and stop them, then jog over to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa. I'm sorry. Sorry, we were just&#8230;you know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
Who's winning?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD AND MCKAY<br />
I am!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Still colicky, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He was awake all day, refused to take a nap.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's not surprising. He got a full night's sleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYAL<br />
Yes, it's remarkable. He slept through the entire ordeal. He hasn't slept through a whole night in um&#8230;ever!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smug)<br />
Well, he can rest easy now, cause, uh, Michael's finally out of the picture.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Unfortunately, there will be somebody else to take his place, of this, I am certain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well he's got SuperMom watching his back. If you ask me, he's in good hands.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks amused. Sheppard leans close and jiggles his finger at the alert child.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Torren, do you want to watch me kick Rodney's ass?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ha, ha. Actually, you may want to cover the child's eyes, because this could get ugly.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla chuckles as her teammates turn and ready their controllers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One&#8230;two&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts his car moving.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! Hey!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts his own car and races to catch up. Teyla continues to bounce her son and laughs at her teammates' antics.]
