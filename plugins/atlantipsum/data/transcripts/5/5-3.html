</p><p><i>[Excerpts from 4.03 "Reunion</i> are shown.]
</p><p><b>END EXCERPTS</b>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla are carrying baskets laden with fruit and vegetables as they walk through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You getting any sleep these days?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Not much, I'm afraid. Although things are a little easier now that Kanaan's request has been granted and he's been allowed to return from the mainland.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How's he liking life in the big city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, he's happy to be reunited with Torren and I, but&#8230;he's having difficulty adjusting to life on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And you once stunned Doctor Gero at your own surprise birthday party.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(unamused)<br />
He spooked me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh-huh. It's difficult for Kanaan. He has Torren and me, of course, but I still think he feels isolated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well, he just needs to make some new friends. You should get him to come by the gym sometime. We could spar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(laughing)<br />
Thank you, that's very kind of you. But I need him one piece for the foreseeable future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(teasing)<br />
Ah, you're no fun.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla laughs. Ronon spots a person lying in the grass in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(alert)<br />
Hey, hey.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla drops her basket and follows Ronon, who's approaching the hooded figure.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(calling out)<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<p>[He moves forward, setting off a hidden mine which explodes in smoke. Disoriented, Ronon is slow to react as the robed figure raises his own stunner weapon and fires. Ronon gets struck several times, finally collapsing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[The figure removes his hood, revealing his features.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Tyre.</blockquote>
<p>[Tyre aims his stunner at Teyla and fires.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey, Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay sit around the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The <i>Daedalus</i> confirms the results of your preliminary search. There's no sign of Ronon's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That means he's still alive. If-if Tyre wanted him dead, we would've found the body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Unless he just took him somewhere to exact a slow revenge&#8230; I don't mean to sound overly negative, but from what I've heard, his mind is seriously warped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And yet, he didn't kill me. It would've been safer for him to leave no witnesses. So&#8230;perhaps despite what the Wraith did to him, Tyre still possesses his Satedan sense of honor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It didn't stop him from ambushing you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(inspired)<br />
Maybe we can use that "Satedan sense of honor" to help us find Ronon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How do you propose to do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We get a Satedan to help us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(drily)<br />
You happen to have one handy, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla knows where one is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(realizing)<br />
Solen Sincha.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He is a survivor of the Wraith attack on Sateda. Ronon and I encountered him on a trade mission to Belkan two years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Judging by your description, he isn't exactly the "settle-down" kind of guy. I mean, what are the chances he's still going to be there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's only one way to find out.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to leave. A still seated Woolsey clears his throat loudly. Everyone pauses. Sheppard sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with exaggerated patiently)<br />
Mister Woolsey, permission to go off-world?</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey takes his time, closing a file and sighing.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You have a go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Oh, and Teyla&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They turn again.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Will you be accompanying Colonel Sheppard and Doctor McKay? I only ask because I've yet to receive your formal request to return to active duty.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks uncomfortable.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course, she'll be returning, right?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at Teyla expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
I have yet to make a decision about my future with the team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Oh. Well, okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He exchanges concerned looks with McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(turning to Woolsey)<br />
However, I would still like to accompany Colonel Sheppard and Doctor McKay to Belkan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[The trio leaves. The doors close as Mister Woolsey gets up and gathers his things. They stay closed as he approaches them. He steps back and tries to get the doors to reopen, but they remain sealed, even as he waves his arm.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SARIF SUR CELL</b>
</p><p>[Ronon awakens to find himself bound to a chair and sitting in a dark cell. He looks around frantically.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(panicked)<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<p>[He spots Tyre sitting nearby. Tyre's eyes are wide and bloodshot.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Where's Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I left her back on the planet. Don't worry, she's fine. You knew I wouldn't hurt her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sneering)<br />
Do I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I accept the fact that you no longer trust me, but I'm hoping that will change in time. Sateda is gone. We're the last of our kind, Ronon. We're brothers, not enemies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're brothers? So I should just forgive you for setting me up last year?</blockquote>
<p>[Tyre stands and approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
If you had just listened to reason, things could've been different. Ara and Rakai would still be alive, and we'd all be working together again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
As Wraith worshippers and traitors to the memories of Sateda? Hell no!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Of course not. I see that now. You're blinded by the past. Lied to by your so-called "friends" on Atlantis. But I still have faith in you, old friend. You just needs to open your eyes to the truth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right. Just untie me, and I'll listen to what you have to say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Heh. Would that be before or after you try to beat me unconscious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know. You choose. Or I could just surprise you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I don't doubt it.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to take a drink from his cup, but his hand shakes spasmodically.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's wrong with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I'm not well. But I've been worse. You know where we are?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon glances around and shrugs in ignorance.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
You remember Sarif Sur, don't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, you almost died on that run.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
We both nearly died because you refused to leave me behind. You risked your life to save me.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes off a Satedan dog-tag.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Today&#8230;I return the favor.</blockquote>
<p>[Shakily, he passes the dog tag to Ronon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;BELKAN VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[The team approach a man sitting at a table, his head resting on his arms and his pistol by his side on the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Solen Sincha?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
(groaning)<br />
Mmm. Go away. Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard drops his pistol on the table with a deliberate clatter, the barrel facing Solen Sincha. Solen looks up, becoming alert as he takes in the military bearing of the trio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We need your help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ronon Dex is in trouble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
Ronon Dex is always in trouble.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, his life is in danger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
Again. What else is new?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits down across from him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
What kind of trouble has he gotten himself into this time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He was abducted by a fellow Satedan&#8212;a Wraith worshipper by the name of Tyre.</blockquote>
<p>[Solen sighs and holsters his pistol. Sheppard does the same with his.]
</p>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
You mean, former Wraith worshipper. Word is, the dog disappointed his masters, so they turned him loose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
Not exactly. So long as he's on the run, he's a living, breathing example of what happens to humans who disappoint them. Tyre's a marked man now. Most anyone I know would kill him on sight. It's just a matter of time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He was once a proud Satedan, not unlike yourself. He was subjected to unimaginable torture. Perhaps he had no choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
(sternly)<br />
There's always a choice. He could've chosen death like a true Satedan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(smoothly)<br />
Any idea where we could find him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
If I knew that, he'd already be dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, Tyre's not thinking straight, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
(cautiously)<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So it's probably just a matter of time before he slips up. And when he does, I'm assuming your leads will hear about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
Probably.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So what do you say, you contact us when you hear something, we'll deal with Tyre and save you the trip.</blockquote>
<p>[Solen studies them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
All right. To Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[He toasts with his bottle of liquor and drinks straight from the bottle.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SARIF SUR CELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Look at you. You can barely walk. Let me get you some help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I'm beyond your help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's the Wraith, isn't it? What did they do to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
At this point, it's not so much what they did to me as what they "aren't" doing to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Giving you life? Reverse-feeding? Whatever the hell it's called?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
It's hard to describe. That sense of euphoria it offers is&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts breathing heavily, licking his lips at the thought.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You became addicted to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
You can't understand unless you've experienced it yourself. It was a gift&#8212;one that was denied me after I allowed you and your friends to escape us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey&#8230;free me, and I'll get you some help. I promise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
Help is already on the way, for both of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(worried)<br />
What does that mean? What the hell did you do?</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens. A Wraith and two soldier Wraith enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I've saved us.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and the Wraith exchange sneers.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Ronon Dex. I looked forward to the day when you would finally serve me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, then, I'm going to feel real bad disappointing you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Oh, I'm sure you'll try. But in the end, you'll come around.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith feeds on Ronon, who cries out in pain.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey unpacks items to decorate his office as Teyla enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mister Woolsey?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Teyla. Any news on Ronon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sighing)<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'm sorry. I suppose we can draw comfort from the fact that he is a proven survivor. He defied the odds for many years as a runner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, he did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How can I help you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I wanted to&#8230;apologize for not having come to you sooner with a decision regarding my position on the colonel's team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Take whatever time you need. If necessary, I can assign someone to fill in for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Oh&#8230;Mister Woolsey, do you have children?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Uh&#8230;no. But I did have a Yorkie for many years.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It's a&#8230;small dog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
But my wife got him in the divorce&#8230;I loved that dog. I never really had the chance to say goodbye. So, no, no children.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then with all due respect, you may not understand how difficult this is for me.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey stops unpacking and gives Teyla his full attention.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
For most of my life, I never imagined the possibility of leaving my people, not even for a moment. And then, circumstances changed. And after realizing a far more important role on Colonel Sheppard's team, I never imagined a day would come when I would have to&#8230;let it go, and now here that day is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Five years ago, if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a job outside of the Milky Way, my answer would've been a definite no. And now&#8230;look at me. So&#8230;while I can't&#8230;empathize, I certainly do sympathize. Believe me, I know&#8230;priorities change.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla considers this.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And sometimes they don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Teyla, I'm sure Kanaan will support you, whatever decision you make.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Of course he will. Thank you, Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SARIF SUR CELL</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith revives Ronon through the feeding process. Ronon, who's hair and skin looked aged, now looks as he did before. He slumps, his face contorted in agony. He has a feeding wound on his chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
How does it feel to have your life stolen? To be pushed so close to the darkness, only to be pulled back from the brink? From what I understand, it's a magnificent sensation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
To be honest, I've felt better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Defy me all you want. Your fellow Satedans were no different. Like them, you will eventually submit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'll die before I submit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
No, you won't.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith begins to feed again. Ronon tries to resist, but finally roars in pain.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters and stares with unusual distaste at the breakfast buffet. He turns and spots Sheppard sitting alone at a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! You're up early!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's ten A.M.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sits down across from Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is? Uh, gah, I didn't sleep at all, I was up all night thinking about this Ronon situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Got anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nothing. I tried everything: pacing, snacking, bathing&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Bathing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. Like Archimedes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean the Greek scientist who had a crush on Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, like the Greek mathematician who came up with the Archimedes principle&#8212;the physical laws of buoyancy? According to legend, the idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so&#8230;look the point is, that the revelation occurred while he was, you know, relaxing. You know, not thinking about the problem. And the solution, as it turned out, was right in front of him all along.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think we've overlooked something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. Maybe? Look, all I know is I was up all night going over it, and I'm drawing a blank. So&#8230;I could use a fresh perspective.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not taking a bath with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, let's&#8230;just go over what we know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
According to Solen, Tyre's on the run. And we can assume he's operating alone, because, if he had backup, they would've been in on the ambush.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. He's alone, with Ronon, on the run. So, where would someone like that go? Well, I could think of something like 200 uninhabited planets that would be perfect. Where do you want to start?</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne arrives at the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
How about Sarif Sur?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We just got a message from Ronon's buddy Solen. He hears that Tyre and Ronon are holed up on a planet called Sarif Sur.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you, Archimedes.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gets up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Major, get your team and gear up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SARIF SUR CELL</b>
</p><p>[Tyre leans close to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
There's just no point in holding on. You're just putting off the inevitable. It's better if you just accept it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(weakly, but bitter)<br />
You mean better for you, don't you? The Wraith cut you off, and this is your way back in, by offering me up as a sacrifice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(weeping)<br />
You're not the man I risked my life for. You are a traitor to the memory of our people. You have no honor.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens and the lead Wraith reenters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Things are progressing too slowly. I have other matters to attend to. We can continue this process back at the lab.</blockquote>
<p>[Tyre stumbles to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
And when will I receive my reward?</blockquote>
<p>[The guards approach Ronon and stun him into unconsciousness for transport. Tyre doesn't even glance back, solely looking at the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Your reward?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
I brought him here as we agreed. In exchange, you promised to restore our previous arrangement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Huh. Did I?</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith turns to go.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRE<br />
You promised!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith spins and grabs Tyre by the throat, choking him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint, since your usefulness has come to an end.</blockquote>
<p>[He throws Tyre back against the wall. The guards drag the unconscious Ronon with them, following the leader.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate kawooshes. Lorne's team and Sheppard and McKay head out. Sheppard looks up at the balcony where Woolsey stands before he leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll get him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
See that you do, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SARIF SUR, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay, and Lorne's teams spread out through the village.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SARIF SUR BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard checks out the upper level of a building while McKay scans downstairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[He heads down to join McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
So we were wrong. It has been known to happen. Hey, I always said this was a long shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel, this is Lorne. We've got something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I knew it!</blockquote>
<p>[They rush out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SARIF SUR, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Over here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SARIF SUR CELL</b>
</p><p>[Lorne leads them over to where some of his team stand over an unconscious Tyre.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We checked his pulse. It's barely there. We gotta move him, or we lose him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where's Ronon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good question.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Tyre lies strapped to an infirmary bed, unconscious, but spasming and twitching in his sleep.]

His injuries are minor, but&#8230;both his heart-rate and blood pressure are elevated. He woke up about an hour after you brought him in. He was delirious; he was sweating, nauseous, trembling.

(warily)<br />
Anyone in particular?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You, if you don't loosen these straps and get me something to eat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grinning)<br />
That-that is a good sign! That's a good sign!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay bounds out of the room, elated.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shouting as he leaves)<br />
He's back! He's back!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey, Sheppard, McKay, Teyla, and Keller, sit around the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
So he's fully recovered?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, physically, he's still weak, but his blood-work shows no traces of the enzyme in his system. So, he should be back to his old self in no time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Good to hear. Well, it's late. I think I'll head back to my quarters and change into something a little more relaxed. Good night.</blockquote>
<p>[He gets up and gathers his items. He pauses a moment, but this time the doors open for them. He glances at Sheppard with a satisfied smile. The others start to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John, may I have a word?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Sure.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey opens the door to find Teyla standing there. Classical music plays from his stereo. He is dressed in a grey suit and holds a glass of red wine.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Teyla. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I thought you said you were changing into something more relaxed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
For me, this is more relaxed. Can I offer you a drink?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, thank you. I just spoke with John, and now I would like to make it official. I am requesting a return to active duty. I would like to resume my position on Colonel Sheppard's team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You're sure this is what you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Very much so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, then, welcome back.</blockquote>
<p>[He toasts her with his glass.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you, Mister Woolsey. Good night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good night.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla exits. Woolsey turns up the music and stares out the window, still nursing his wine.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Kanaan holds Torren as Teyla enters. He hands over their son. She cradles him as Kanaan looks on, smiling.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BATHROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay relaxes in a bubble bath. Struck by sudden inspiration, he sluffs off the bubbles from his hand, grabs the tablet computer from nearby, and starts to work.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon lies unrestrained in a hospital bed. Sheppard enters, carrying Tyre's sword. Wordlessly, he lays the sword at Ronon's side on the bed, hesitates, nods, and leaves. Ronon unsheathes the sword and studies it before cradling it to his chest.]
