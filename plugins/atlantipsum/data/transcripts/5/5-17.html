</p><p>[McKay, Ronon, Teyla, and Woolsey are amongst the personnel in the control room, watching a monitor showing a hive ship approaching their planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How long until they get here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just a matter of minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Are we prepared to cloak the city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I've made all the necessarily modifications. But, for the record, I still say the shield is a better idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, that cloak offers us no protection whatsoever. If that hive opens up on us&#8212;-</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How could they do that? They'd have to know our <i>exact</i> position on the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, you're assuming they don't? Look, we've been tracking them for days. They're headed straight for us. I think it's safe to say they've got some inside information!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Even so, it's better not to confirm our location until we know for sure. No sense in giving them an easy target to shoot at.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits in the control chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Standing by.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Be prepared to fire drones on my mark.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Copy that. Just say the word.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Well, I suppose we're as prepared as we can be. Engage the cloak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grumbling)<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay types some commands.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The city disappears from view.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Cloak's engaged. They should be here momentarily.</blockquote>
<p>[They wait.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A hive ship exits hyperspace and approaches Atlantis.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everyone watches as the ship holds position above the planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
Nothing. From what I can tell, they're just sitting here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do they know we're here?</blockquote>
<p>[The computer beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, hang on. We're receiving a transmission. It's a file of some kind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Pull it up on a fire-walled computer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay moves to a different computer and types some commands. Wraith characters appear on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's it say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's nothing&#8230;just a random bunch of&#8230;<br />
(snapping fingers)<br />
Wait a second.</blockquote>
<p>[He types some commands.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(intrigued)<br />
Well, it's encrypted. Using the same kind of algorithm we use on the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[The screen resolves into video of Todd.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(on video screen)<br />
Hold your fire&#8230;.gene therapy developed&#8230;by Doctor Keller&#8230;formulation&#8230;my crew.</blockquote>
<p>[The garbled transmission shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
I don't know. It's like the file's corrupted somehow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(on video screen)<br />
Initial results&#8230;but nothing was able to counteract the disease&#8230;Help us.</blockquote>
<p>[The transmission completely shuts down with a file error displayed.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What on Earth does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have no idea.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you mean, "you didn't understand him?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
The file was corrupted. We were only able to catch a few words here and there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Though, from what we could tell, it seemed like he was asking for our help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
With what?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between the control room and the chair room.]'</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Something to do with Jennifer's gene therapy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We already gave him a chance to test it. He double-crossed us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I say we blow him out of the sky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I can't say I disagree with you. Though I do find it odd he would just show up here, knowing that would likely be our reaction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And why send a file? Why not just radio us directly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whatever he wants, it must be really important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps we should&#8230;answer back. Tell him that we did not receive the file properly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If we do that, we might as well just drop the cloak. Then they'll be able to trace our radio signal and know exactly where we are. No. We might be able to do it from the jumper, though. You know, approach the hive cloaked and communicate with them from there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
But then they would be able to pinpoint the jumper's exact location.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, but the jumper's a lot more maneuverable than the city. Look, besides, this isn't the first time we've flown up to Todd's doorstep in a jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Any chance you could clean up that video? Piece together more of what he's saying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, there's too much data missing. That is as good as we're going to get.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
All right. Colonel?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is already walking out of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On my way.</blockquote>

</p>

Coming up on it now.<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Colonel John Sheppard. Please come in.</blockquote>
<p>[There is no response.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We didn't receive your video transmission correctly. Please respond.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Are they getting this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They should be. I mean, there's no reason why they&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The console beeps. McKay looks at his screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not picking up any life signs on board.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe Rodney is correct. I have also not been able to detect the presence of any Wraith. I thought it was because we were too far, but this makes more sense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It does?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This better not be a Wraith ship from another reality.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
We've been tracking their approach for a few days now, remember? It didn't just pop into our space like that other <i>Daedalus</i> did. Look, we know that they don't show up on our scans when they're hibernating. I'd say that's probably a more logical explanation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(dubious)<br />
Hibernating? All of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they could've preprogrammed the ship to fly here on its own, enter orbit, even send a prerecorded signal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there's only one way to find out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
We're receiving a signal. It's Colonel Sheppard on a secure channel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Patch me in.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel, what's happening up there?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the jumper and Atlantis.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the Wraith have thrown us a little curve ball here. We've got no life signs on board. We think they're hibernating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Why would they do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what we'd like to find out but it means boarding the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Are you sure that's wise? What if it's a trap?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if it is, it's a pretty lousy one. If they ambush us, you can still take 'em out from down there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Sacrificing your lives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm flattered you think Todd would go to such trouble to kill me. Look, taking out a hive ship is always a good idea as far as I'm concerned, but we did come all this way&#8230;and got all dressed up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The team cautiously explore.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No sign of 'em yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why is it that I find empty hives even creepier than the ones that are full of Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Trust me, we're better off this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Bridge should be up here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The team enters. McKay moves to the controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. Just&#8230;give me a few seconds.</blockquote>
<p>[He moves to a control station.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[He works with the systems.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I was right. They're all in their hibernation pods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There are several large chambers in the aft section of the hive. The weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla glances over, concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the normal operating procedure would be to leave a few crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time. But since they all went in, I would assume there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So&#8230;if we do not wake them&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then they never will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sounds good to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you not find it odd that Todd would leave himself and his entire crew to our mercy? Especially after our last encounter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe he's not as smart as you think he is.</blockquote>
<p>[The power flickers, the generator shutting down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Some kind of power fluctuation. I'm reading minor malfunctions in several of the ship's systems. Hang on&#8230;I got Todd's video file. It looks like it's intact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you said it was corrupted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it must've happened in transmission, some kind of a glitch in the comm system. The original, it's all there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[He taps some controls and the video appears.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(over video)<br />
Hold your fire! We mean you know harm! Allow me to explain our presence here before you take any action. If you are seeing this message, my ship has arrived safely at Atlantis. I am coming to you because my crew and I have been stricken with a disease&#8212; a complication to the gene therapy developed by Doctor Keller&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a second. We didn't give them&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(continuing, over video)<br />
&#8230;I acquired some of the formulation while my crew and I were occupying the <i>Daedalus</i>&#8230;I admit, I wanted to see if it would actually work. And it did. The initial results were nothing short of astonishing. See for yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds up his feeding hand. It has no opening, and except for the long fingernails and greenish tinge, it looks human.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(continuing, over video)<br />
I was so impressed, I decided to treat my entire crew. It was only then that we began to notice problems. The first group&#8230;grew sick and died. Before long, others began to get sick as well. Our natural healing ability was unable to counteract the disease. I come here as a matter of last resort&#8230;<br />
(weakly, as if very ill)<br />
I realize we have had our differences of late&#8230;and you may be reluctant to&#8230;help us. But remember this&#8212;if we die, any hope you may have of distributing this treatment in the future dies with us &#8230; The choice is yours.</blockquote>
<p>[The team look very disturbed.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team has returned and gives Woolsey a report.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, so&#8230;now that we know what happened, we can just fire drones on them, and close the file and move on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You said his feeding hand was clean, which means the treatment worked, at least for a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, then it started killing them, so I don't know if they're going to exactly line up for this one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Which is why we need to find out exactly what went wrong. We need to examine every scrap of medical data on that hive. We may even need to revive a few of the Wraith so Doctor Keller can perform a complete physical evaluation. I'm sorry, but the IOA is strongly committed to the development of this gene therapy. It's one of the only things they all agree on. If it's simply not workable, so be it. But they're going to want to see some proof.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I say it works fine. It kills Wraith. What more do you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You're suggesting we keep the formula as is and find a way of exposing them involuntarily.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why not? Get rid of the Wraith once and for all. Don't tell me the IOA would have a problem with that.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey nods in consideration.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The problem is in the delivery systems. We just went down this road with Beckett's retrovirus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And even if we do succeed in weaponizing the treatment. It is unlikely that we would wipe out the Wraith entirely. At best, we would&#8230;weaken them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't have a problem with that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
On the other hand, if we do succeed in eliminating their need to feed, we might be able to convince their entire population to take the treatment willingly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Either way, whether it's perfecting the formula as a treatment or a weapon, we need to gather as much information as we possibly can, which brings me back to the same conclusion&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We need to go back up there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
This time, have Doctor Keller accompany you, as well as Major Lorne's team <i>and</i> another unit of marines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you still not sure if it's a trap?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Let's just say I've learned to exercise an abundance of caution when dealing with Todd.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You did?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nodding)<br />
Mm-hmm. The treatment worked exactly like it was supposed to do. It eliminated their feeding hands, it activated their digestive systems just like it did in the simulation. But, unfortunately, it also created a&#8230;virulent, cancer-like disease at the same time that it was weakening their immune system. That's what killed them.</blockquote>

He was just a warrior drone. Look, we've long suspected that they spend the majority of their life under the controlling mental influence of the other Wraith.

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sheppard. You're going to want to get up here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Keller)<br />
Keep working.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller gets back to work.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard joins McKay on the bridge just as there's another shaking rumble.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It looks like Todd's estimate of how long the ship's going to last is a little off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shows Sheppard a schematic of the ship on a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You remember that hole we saw? It's getting bigger, it's beginning to threaten the hull integrity, but that's not the biggest problem. See that?<br />
(he points at another terminal)<br />
That is a line of structural weakness right across the width of the hive. If there's an explosive decompression, this entire thing could be ripped in half.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worriedly into radio)<br />
This is Sheppard. All teams fall back. Fall back immediately.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR, TEYLA'S AREA</b>
</p><p>[Teyla's in a firefight with Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(shouting into radio)<br />
We are not finished dealing with the Wraith yet!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Just leave 'em. The hull's failing. Get the hell out of there!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR, LORNE'S AREA</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
All right, you heard the man. Let's move!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR, TEYLA'S AREA</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Let's go! Let's go!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR, RONON'S AREA</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Come on! Hurry up!</blockquote>
<p>[They are ambushed by Wraith. The marine goes down. Ronon turns to help but he too is tackled. His gun is knocked away and he struggles to keep a Wraith from biting him, punching it several times in the face. Teyla's team arrive and shoot the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ach. Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks over to where a marine checks Ronon's colleague and shakes his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Let's get the hell out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[He gets to his feet with a groan. They run and meet up with Lorne and another marine struggling with a closed door.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
The door's jammed. It won't open.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, this is Teyla, We are stuck behind a door that will not open. Can you help us?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Look, the controls are malfunctioning. I can't seem to override them. Just give me a minute.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[They hear sounds of movement coming towards them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We might not have a minute, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[Wraith descend on their position again and they are locked in a firefight.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR, BRIDGE SIDE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard jogs to the other side of the door. He hears gunfire from his friends, but he can't get it open either.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, crap.</blockquote>
<p>[He tries to pry the door open.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[An alarm begins to sound. McKay checks the monitors.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
Oh, no. Uh, guys? You need to get out of there now. You hear me? Get out of there now!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla, Lorne and the others provide cover fire. Between Ronon and a marine's efforts on one side, and Sheppard's on the other, the door is able to be pried open.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go!</blockquote>
<p>[The others back away into the door, giving each other cover fire as they reach safety. Sheppard also provides cover fire, then escapes with them. The door closes before a Wraith can follow.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship breaks in half horizontally across the ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(frantic)<br />
Sheppard! Come in! Please!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Everyone catches their breath in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(breathless)<br />
Yeah, we're here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the bridge and corridor.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(relieved)<br />
Oh, thank god. Then I take it the bulkhead held?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, for now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I was able to seal off the section so we won't depressurize, but you need to get down here&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Alerts sound on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, what now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The force of the ship's tearing itself apart. It's shifted our trajectory. We're headed straight for the planet!</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone exchanges worried looks as the ship shudders.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The front half of the hive ship tumbles out of orbit towards the surface of Atlantis, nearly nose-down.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The rest of the Atlantis team arrives on the bridge; Keller is still in the science lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's our status, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I would say "screwed" is an apt description.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are we going to burn up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, we're going to survive reentry. In fact, it'll even slow us down a little. But nowhere near enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Can you get us over the water?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Land, water&#8212;at the speed we're traveling, it's not going to matter. We're going to be vaporized on impact!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've got to do something!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now think!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(focusing)<br />
I don't know&#8230;okay, right. Forward maneuvering thrusters. They should be unaffected, but they're not getting any power, because the propulsion conduits have been ripped in half. All right, look, I may be able to reroute power to them, so they can slow our descent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, now you're talking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(despairing)<br />
The only problem is, I haven't a clue how to do it! Look, I mean, even if the systems weren't all malfunctioning, it would still take me a few hours to create that kind of work-around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, just keep working on it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to run out of the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Where the hell are you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(not stopping)<br />
To go get some help.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs and grumbles to himself as he turns back to the controls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIG AREA</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard jogs up to Todd's cell. Todd sits on a bench, facing away from the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(not facing him)<br />
You can't quite leave me be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I don't have time to play games. You know what that shaking is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Oh, I can guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've lost orbit. We're entering the atmosphere, which means in a few minutes, we're going to slam into that planet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(shouting)<br />
A quick death will be a welcome reprieve!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Aw, I didn't think you were such a quitter. Look, you get this ship on the ground, I'll take you to your bug planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
And you expect me to believe that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My word.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd rises and faces Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
And my crew?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
They're dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd growls.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The ship sheared in two. We lost the entire rear section.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(furious)<br />
If we had gone to the planet when I suggested it, none of this would've happened!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We would've never made it there, and you know it. The hull was too badly damaged. Now, I understand you're pissed off about your crew, but we're about to join them unless somebody manages to slow us down, so are you going to help us out?</blockquote>
<p>[Todd snarls at Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Todd enter the bridge. Teyla is manning the helm, McKay next to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We're in the atmosphere. Altitude on hundred thousand feet. It is of no use. I can't control it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Move aside!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay stumbles back. Teyla lets Todd take the helm and moves to another station.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
You sure about this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What can he do? We're in a free fall.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I believe I can successfully create a bypass that will deliver power to the forward thrusters, but it will take a few moments.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, you just take your time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Impact in fifteen seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Not if I can help it. Firing thrusters!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS ORBIT</b>
</p><p>[The ship begins to slow as the thrusters fire.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Forty thousand feet, still descending too fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not enough!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(roaring)<br />
Instead of criticizing, perhaps you could work at getting me some more power!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm on it!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rushes to another station.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Twenty thousand feet, still too fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Angle the thrusters, try to get the ship level. We can fly her across the water. Trust me, I've done this before.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd growls skeptically.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ten thousand feet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's it. That's all the power we've got!</blockquote>
<p>[Todd hisses.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS SKY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The ship starts to level off, now flying less steeply but still descending over the water.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Everyone looks anxious as the ship vibrates around them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Two thousand feet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is it! We're about to lose inertial dampeners.</blockquote>
<p>[They all brace for impact, including Keller still in the lab.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The ship skims the water before settling into a relatively gentle crash, the impact wave moving outward around the ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[A monitor shows the crash site. Woolsey stands by Banks's station.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
They just hit the water. I've got the coordinates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Relay them to the rescue jumpers immediately.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits in a chair reading. Sheppard enters, moving slowly.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Colonel. Good to see you back on your feet. How's the rest of your team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, recovering. We took quite a jolt when we hit the water.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits in a chair next to Woolsey.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I can imagine. You were lucky. By the time Major Kersey and his team were able to blast their way down to your position, the hive, what remained of it, was already half full of water. It sank minutes after they extracted you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm. Wish I was awake to see that.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glances at the monitor near them. It shows Todd in an isolation ward in the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Not well. He hasn't responded to any treatment.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks troubled. Woolsey closes his book.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I received your request.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but&#8230;weren't you the one who wanted to destroy his ship when it first appeared?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm, sounds vaguely familiar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
And now you want me to go against protocol and let him go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, he is the reason we're alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I realize that Colonel. He's also the reason you were in danger in the first place, not to mention an incredible security risk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, look. He's probably going to die anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
And if he survives?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If he survives, he's going to remember what we did. Like it or not, he's the best ally we've had in the fight against the Wraith. If we ever get around to perfecting this gene therapy, we're going to need his help to deploy it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You realize this is the kind of decision that could cost me my job?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Well, aren't they all?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stands before the active Stargate. Todd is escorted to him by some marines.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I appreciate your decision to let me go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A deal's a deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I will remember this, John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard studies Todd as Todd gives him an enigmatic smile then steps into the wormhole alone. Sheppard looks on as the gate shuts down.]
