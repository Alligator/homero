<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Excerpts from 3.18 "The Kindred Part 1", 3.19 "The Kindred Part 2", and 3.20 "The Last Man" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla, dressed in nice civilian clothing, toast each other with wine glasses over a meal. The room is lit with candles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is perfect. Just what I needed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It truly has been a hectic several weeks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Try four years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(grinning)<br />
Very true. In a way, it makes these calmer moments even more special. I cherish these times, when it is just you and me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Me too.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange looks. Sheppard shifts, suddenly awkward.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You, uh&#8230;you've got an early morning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I never got to properly thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
For what? For rescuing me!</blockquote>
<p>[She grins. Sheppard looks puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
From Michael! I never gave up hope, because I knew. I knew that you would come for me, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(voice faltering)<br />
I know this sounds crazy, but&#8230;I don't remember&#8230;rescuing you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns away, studying the candlelight, trying to remember.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You don't remember rescuing her, because you didn't.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns to find not Teyla sitting across from him, but Ford, looking haunted and accusing.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Just like you never rescued me.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gasps in pain and notices blood starting to stain his white shirt. He is bleeding from his right side.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard awakens with a gasp and coughs to find himself surrounded by rubble.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sheppard! Hey, buddy.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's vision is blurred at first, but eventually he becomes alert. He is pinned under a metal beam. Ronon shifts around him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(weak and hoarse)<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Michael's compound. It collapsed on us.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard tries to move, but can't. The effort brings renewed pain and he groans.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(soothing)<br />
Hey&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(panting)<br />
I think I&#8230;I&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, let me take a look.</blockquote>
<p>[He sees a piece of metal reinforcement imbedded in Sheppard's side. He reaches forward and with a sudden move pulls the rebar out from where it's impaled his friend. Sheppard gasps and cries out in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(weakly)<br />
Gaaah. What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon prepares a bandage.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Just a little scrape. No big deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know. We got separated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Try them on the radio.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, UPPER LEVEL</b>
</p><p>[McKay can only get static on his radio. He is covered in dust with minor injuries. Lorne sits nearby, groaning in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no signal. There's too much interference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(in pain)<br />
I'm pretty sure my leg is broken.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I think I'm remarkably fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Well, isn't that wonderful. That brings me great comfort. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think we're that deep. I can see daylight. If I can just&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He tries to shift some of the overhead debris and small rubble and dust rain down on them both. Lorne cries out in pain as some strike his injured leg.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry! I just&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I posted Edison at the entrance of the building. He'll get help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That is assuming he wasn't hit by falling debris.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Doc, the <i>Daedalus</i> left Atlantis when we were still confirming Sheppard's story. With that kind of a head start, they should be here in less than&#8230;three hours. So, one way or the other, help is on the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry. I'm just-I'm not good at tight spaces.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay fidgets.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Look, there's no bad guys around, okay? No bad guys. Just a lot of debris. So&#8230;if you could please just sit tight and try not to make the ceiling collapse, that would be great!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Okay! No bad guys. Just got to&#8230;just sit tight.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks up through the ruins.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Panning out form the warehouse, past the orbit of the planet with one moon where the team is trapped, out through the rest of the system, past nebulas and across hyperspace, there is another system with a sole yellow star and a planet with two moons. In orbit there is Michael's ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIDGE, MICHAEL'S SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Kanaan brings Michael a report. Michael studies it, looking concerned at its contents.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
When did you get this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Moments ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(announcing)<br />
Change of plans! We're setting a new course. Our compound has been compromised.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Michael's ship enters hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Unscheduled offworld activation. It's Lieutenant Edison's IDC.</blockquote>
<p>[Edison, covered with dust, limps through the active wormhole. Carter meets him as technicians setting up equipment and a MALP stand nearby. He is bleeding and appears in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What happened? Where's the rest of your team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EDISON<br />
(gasping for breath)<br />
There was a massive explosion. Everyone was in the main compound. The whole building imploded on itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Were there any survivors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EDISON<br />
Radios are down. Uh, I don't know. I just thought I should get back here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No, you did the right thing.<br />
(to medics)<br />
Get him to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<p>[Two medics escort Edison.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to Banks)<br />
How far away is the <i>Daedalus</i>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Still two hours out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We can't wait that long. Have the combat engineers gear up, and have Doctor Keller ready her away team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445 NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, UPPER LEVEL</b>
</p><p>[McKay tries to hold pieces of computer equipment up to the light, discarding what he cannot salvage.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm claustrophobic. I'm trying to keep my mind busy, which is&#8230;hard because, you know, it's&#8230;my mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
Yeah&#8230; Well, there's no way anything useful survived that implosion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, speak for yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You know what I mean, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I found a bunch of computer parts, all right. The motherboards are all fried or snapped, but some of these hard drives look like they might still be intact. If I could just get the power to&#8230;hello, hello!</blockquote>
<p>[His computer starts to show Wraith data.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What is it? Something good?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. It's a lot of information. Hold on&#8230;I think I just hit the jackpot!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What, someway to broadcast a signal? Let people know our location? Speed up the rescue? What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(abashed)<br />
No, although in hindsight, I would say, you're right. That should probably be considered "the jackpot." But no, this is a hard-drive. I can only access what's on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Which is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's Michael's wiki! It survived the explosion!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
The what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excited)<br />
Michael's database. It's a large chunk of it, maybe the whole thing, too. I mean, we've got, uh, base schematics, uh, uh, medical research information, lists of planets. I mean, you know what this means?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(surly)<br />
Yeah, it means we're still stuck here, and I still have a broken leg.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, in the short term, but if we get out of here&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
If?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We'd have him on the run. He'd be finished&#8230;Look, if Michael&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The computer beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
Oh no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I-I don't want to concern you any more than you actually already are, but if I'm reading this correctly, then Michael is&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(listening intently)<br />
Shut up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
No, no. You shut up, this is important! If Michael is&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Ssh. Ssh! Quit making noise.</blockquote>
<p>[They both fall silent as a rhythmic creaking sounds above them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's footsteps.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Okay, revise that. Start making noise!<br />
(calling out)<br />
Hey! Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Down here! We're down here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Hey! Help!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445, SURFACE</b>
</p><p>[Above them, Carter leads the search and rescue team that's scouring the ruins. In her hands is a life signs detector.]
</p>
<blockquote>ENGINEER<br />
Peters! Yeah, bring them straight through!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right, we've got four life signs in two different locations. First two should be right beneath us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Listen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY AND LORNE<br />
(distant and muffled)<br />
Hey! Down here! Hey, hey! We're down here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(calling down)<br />
McKay, is that you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, thank god, yes!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, UPPER LEVEL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm trapped down here with Lorne!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(muffled, distant)<br />
Are you okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're fine!</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Hey, Doc!</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures to his leg.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, right, right. Okay, Lorne's got a broken leg.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS SURFACE, M2S-445, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation continues to switch between the surface and McKay and Lorne's location.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right, McKay. Stay put. We've got combat engineers here. We're going to dig you out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, hurry it up!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We'll work as fast as is safe, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. You don't understand. I just found out that when the self-destruct is initiated, it's automatically programmed to send a subspace burst. Michael's probably already on his way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
It doesn't like they're too far down. We should be able to get them out inside of an hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, what about the other two?</blockquote>
<p>[Carter checks her scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
They're a lot deeper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, the <i>Daedalus</i> will be here soon, so then we can just&#8230;beam them out, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
As long as Michael doesn't get here first.<br />
(calling out)<br />
All right, let's get started.<br />
(to Rivers)<br />
Rivers, take a jumper into orbit and keep a lookout for Michael's ship. Let me know the second he gets here.</blockquote>
<p>[The crew begins to work.]
</p>
<blockquote>ENGINEER<br />
Yeah, right through here. I got it&#8230;Yeah, we're ready.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, DEEPER LEVEL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, okay. One&#8230;two&#8230;three!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Sheppard try to shift the beam pinning him, to no avail. Ronon pants with the effort.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This thing ain't moving. I wonder what happened to the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't know. It happened pretty quickly. I doubt that many people made it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So stupid. Of course the building was booby trapped. I should've seen that coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well none of us did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but I'm the guy. You know? Like "the guy."</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Everyone knew what we were getting into. We all knew how dangerous it was, so don't beat yourself up about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, you need to start thinking about how to crawl your way out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Aw, no way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm serious. You just keeping moving up, keep moving the debris. Work your way up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm not leaving you behind, Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon tries to work with some pipes as a lever on the beam.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not trying to be a hero here. It's a selfish thing.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon strains trying to lift up the beam, but the pipe doesn't work.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I need you to dig a hole, so that the rescuers can come down and get me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon tries to shift the debris from underneath Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's the wrong way, Chief.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We get this beam off you. We get you free. We dig ourselves out together. Deal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You ain't going to listen to me one way or the other, are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Great, deal.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard grunts and nods.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Michael's ship flies through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Teyla is strapped down on a table. Michael runs a scanner over her abdomen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Excellent. This is all very good. Your son should be making an appearance any day now.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla's expression is blank and stern. Michael appears nonplussed by her reaction.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I thought that would make you happy. I can't imagine carrying a child inside of you is very comfortable&#8230; I will not harm him. Why can't you just accept that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(with heavy emotion)<br />
Because I know you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
All these worlds. Filled with "people", busying themselves with their pathetic lives. They come and they go. They live and they die, and the galaxy is no better for it. But your son&#8230;your son will be the instrument of change. He will be remembered for the ages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And what of his mother? You speak often of his future, but never of mine. Why is that?</blockquote>
<p>[While Teyla speaks, Kanaan enters. He starts and listens intently to the conversation, staying in the background.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
I had hoped that you would&#8230;I had hoped that you would understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
It's time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(swallowing)<br />
Very well. Remove the restraints, and post a guard outside this door.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael leaves. Kanaan removes the restraints.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I must escape before our child is born! He will kill me once I am of no use to him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
I can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Kanaan, why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
It's too dangerous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
For who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
He will kill us.<br />
(he looks at her belly)<br />
Kill us all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, he will. Whether you help me or not. You are disposable to him, can you not see that?</blockquote>
<p>[She clutches at him. He takes her hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Listen to me&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm sounds. Kanaan pulls away and exits. The door closes behind him. Teyla struggles off the table trying to follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Kanaan, please! Please!</blockquote>
<p>[She is left behind.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS SURFACE, M2S-445, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The rescue team pulls McKay and his computer out of the hole. Keller is instantly there to treat him as he moves aside for Lorne to get out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hi. Hi. Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come over here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm fine. It's just a&#8212;just a couple scrapes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Wow. Rodney McKay refusing medical help. Now I really know there's something wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to run her scanner over him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously, I'm okay. Just&#8212;you should look after Lorne.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks over to where the team is just pulling Lorne out. She hurries over. Carter joins McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Any survivors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We found two other life signs, but they're buried under a lot more debris than you were, so it's going to take a little longer. We've got people working on it.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller and Vega help Lorne down. He stifles a cry as he's lowered to the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know who it is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(shaking her head)<br />
Not yet. Rodney, did you find Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, but I think Sheppard was right. He was going to bring her here. We just&#8212;we came too soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RIVERS<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Carter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RIVERS<br />
Ma'am, a Wraith cruiser just came out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Michael's here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Michael's ship orbits the planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Multiple life signs. It must be the Atlantians.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(smiling)<br />
They're combing the debris. But they must know it's too dangerous to stay here. They're searching for survivors. This might not be a total loss after all.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WAREHOUSE RUINS, M2S-445, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Everyone, fall back to your jumpers!</blockquote>
<p>[The search and rescue crew begin to evacuate. A dart can be heard in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
We've got incoming!</blockquote>
<p>[A dart flies overhead. Vega strafes it with weapons fire. She hits it, and it veers off.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Good shot!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
All right, let's fall back to our jumpers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've still got men trapped down here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
They're going to have to wait. We're no good to them out in the open like this. Let's go! Fall back!</blockquote>
<p>[The crew continue to evacuate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Some of the engineers stow into the rear compartment of a jumper. McKay, Carter, Keller, and Vega get into the forward compartment, McKay immediately getting into the pilot's chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Cloak the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Got it.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter studies the copilot controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We're getting a reading. The 'gate's been activated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's classic Wraith battle technique. They dial the 'gate, lock everyone out, make sure they can't escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(ruefully)<br />
Well, it's a good one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, they're not idiots.</blockquote>
<p>[He calls up the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They've got more darts on the way, and they've already got troops on the debris field.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
They must know we've got people down there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How many jumpers do we have?</blockquote>

(surprised)<br />
No, that's impossible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Main power is out across much of the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
An accidental overload?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
It doesn't appear that way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(half to himself)<br />
How did they do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
I will look into it.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(to himself)<br />
They're onboard. How did they get onboard?</blockquote>
<p>[He sets off in another direction.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay has moved to face Teyla, where he can see what is going on.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
Look, can't you just hold it in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This doesn't happen this quick. No one has babies this quick!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My water broke quite a while ago! I've been trying to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[She has another contraction and cries out in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disturbed)<br />
Oh, I can see its head.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(reassuringly)<br />
That's good. That's a good thing, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rapidly)<br />
Yeah, but am I supposed to&#8212; am I supposed-what, am I supposed to touch it? Am I allowed to touch you down there? I don't know what to do!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney, calm down. I need you to be calm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But I'm not an M.D.! I've never been an M.D.!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
People have been having babies for thousands of years. Most of them without doctors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but before doctors, the infant mortality rate was incredibly high. It was only like one in three, I think! Look, a doctor is a very important part of this process. Trust me&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(aggravated)<br />
Rodney! There are no doctors around! You <i>have</i> to do this. We don't have a choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(resigned)<br />
Okay, okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Now&#8230;you need to catch him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Catch him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sternly)<br />
Yes. You need to catch him when I push him out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, god. Okay, well just&#8230;underhand him, all right? I've never been good at baseball.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds his hands out and looks away, wincing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney&#8230;! Please.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I can do this. All right, look, I may have-I may have panicked a little back there, but we're gonna do this. We're gonna do this. I am great with kids&#8212;the little ones, the ones that don't talk back.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes off his jacket to wrap the baby. Teyla winces as another contraction starts.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Here it comes!</blockquote>
<p>[She screams again as McKay reaches down with the jacket, wincing and groaning in disgust.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, almost there. Almost there.</blockquote>
<p>[They both groan again. Finally the baby is out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(elated)<br />
Oh! I caught him! I caught him! I&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The baby cries. McKay looks at him in wonder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's a boy.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla laughs in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Watch his head.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, right. Okay, so, cut. Okay, look at him. Do I get to cut the cord? I get to cut the cord then, right?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, okay, so&#8230;okay. Teyla, I'd like to introduce you to your son.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds the baby out to her. The child is wrapped in McKay's jacket. Teyla laughs in delight. Ronon and Sheppard rush in and stare at the scene.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(delighted)<br />
I caught it. It didn't hit the floor or anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He did a wonderful job.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon crouches by Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's good&#8230;you did good, Rodney. All right, we-we've got to get you out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon, you're going to need to help me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon cradles her in his arms easily as she cradles the baby. McKay grabs his pack and computer as they all leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BAY AREA, MICHAEL'S SHIP</b>
</p><p>[They arrive at where they parked the jumper. Sheppard keys the remote, but nothing happens.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why isn't it de-cloaking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(taking the remote)<br />
Let me see. Did you break it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, no. We parked the jumper right here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard waves his arms around trying to find the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
One hundred percent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Someone stole the jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, this is not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I told you, you should have stayed here.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay futilely keeps trying the remote.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, MICHAEL'S SHIP</b>
</p><p>[The team make their way guardedly through the ship's corridors.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How the hell are we supposed to get off this ship now?</blockquote>
<p>[They all look to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I just delivered a baby! That's not enough for today?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't they have escape pods or things like that on a cruiser?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, they&#8212;they&#8212; Wait, I know. I need to get back to a data terminal. A lot of their internal power's down. Maybe I can short out their jamming code. We can get the <i>Daedalus</i> to beam us out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great. Lead the way.</blockquote>
<p>[They head down a corridor. As they head down a passageway, they startle Kanaan, who is coming from the other direction. They each raise their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Don't shoot!<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Put me down.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon does, raising his weapon. Teyla cradles the baby as she touches Sheppard reassuringly.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's all right, John. This is Kanaan. He is the father.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard lowers his weapon slightly, looking warily from Teyla to Kanaan. Teyla approaches Kanaan. He lowers his weapon and stares at her and the baby. He caresses his son.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is our chance. These are the friends I told you of. They can help you get back to your old self. But first, you have to help us. We must get off this ship! Do you know a way?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAAN<br />
Yes. Follow me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon still has his weapon raised.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No offense, Teyla, but I don't trust this guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He has tried to save me before. I trust him.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Give me your weapon.</blockquote>
<p>[Kanaan immediately does.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's your plan?</blockquote>

</p><p>[Carter is no longer on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Sir&#8230;we've got a dart trying to hail us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What? Let me hear it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
This is Colonel John Sheppard. Authentication code Bravo Delta Charlie Alpha Niner. <i>Daedalus</i>, please come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Authenticated. Colonel Sheppard, what the hell happened to your jumper?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DART</b>
</p><p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between Caldwell's and Sheppard's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I got turned around in the parking garage. I was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart. I've got the team beamed into a storage device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Do you have Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, and the baby.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(incredulous)<br />
You beamed a baby into Wraith storage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. I've got him right here.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks down at the infant cradled in his arms.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So&#8230;feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Copy that.<br />
(to Marks)<br />
Major Marks, please make that ship go away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Marks activates his controls.]

</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> fires a beam weapon at the cruiser, destroying it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, why don't you head down to the planet, beam your crew out, and land that dart? I'm pretty sure you can dial up that Stargate now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Copy that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DART</b>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay heads down a corridor carrying a bouquet of flowers. He passes Carter, who's heading the other direction, carrying two large duffle bags.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, what's with the bags?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
What's with the flowers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Going to see Teyla. Oh, you probably heard. I delivered her baby.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(brightly)<br />
I did! And they tell me she's going to name him Rodney!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay does a fist pump.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes! Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
No. Not really.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's face falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(flatly)<br />
Oh, that's funny. Where are you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Back to Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Oh, they caught the last Ba'al clone. The Tok'ra are going to extract the symbiote. They want SG-1 to put in an appearance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Plus, the IOA want to do an "exhaustive" review of my first year in command, so, you know&#8230;that can't be good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you crazy? They probably want to give you a medal. You had a great year. I know my opinion doesn't mean much to those folks, but, um&#8230;I think you've done an excellent job. I'm glad you took the post.</blockquote>
<p>[Carter smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Thanks, Rodney, that means a lot. Tell Sheppard the court martial will have to wait.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks puzzled.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sure. See you soon.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways.]
</p>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nervously, under her breath)<br />
Hope so.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard are in beds next to each other in the infirmary. Teyla holds her son. Sheppard is playing a hand-held video game.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How long will the surgery take?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doc says a few hours. But I'll be off my feet for a week or so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I cannot believe you attempted to mount a rescue in your condition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Attempted?" Last time I checked, I succeeded! How's the kid?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor Keller says he's perfectly healthy. I say he's perfectly everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(smiling, nodding)<br />
That's great. That's great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I want to thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's no need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I never gave up hope, because I knew. I knew that you would come for me, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You would've done the same for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller arrives, wearing her surgical scrubs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
All right, you ready, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ready? From my understanding, I&#8230;I'm not doing anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(brightly)<br />
Yeah, that's right. You just have to lay still and let me play with your insides.</blockquote>
<p>[No one else is amused by her joke.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Sorry. Um, let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[The surgical team starts to wheel Sheppard away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
What are you gonna name the kid?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, if it's all right with you, I was thinking of Torren John. After my father, and after you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really? Wow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(amused)<br />
McKay's going to hate that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I would be very honored!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Very well. Torren John Emmagan.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Colonel Carter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
Mister Woolsey, how are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Very well, thank you for asking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(hopefully)<br />
So, is this whole "evaluation process" going to take very long? I mean, there's a lot of work to be done on Atlantis, and I'm kind of anxious to get back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
I'm sure you are. However, the IOA has decided that perhaps someone with a different skill set would be more suited to lead the Atlantis expedition now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'm here to inform you that, effective immediately, you are being removed from command.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
(shocked)<br />
Um&#8230;who-who's replacing me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
As a matter of fact&#8230;I am.</blockquote>
