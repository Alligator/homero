<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon sit at an outside balcony table in the mess hall. McKay joins them with his tray.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I find it sad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mister Woolsey. He seems lonely.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods over to where people are still gathering their food, Woolsey among them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He does?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He never takes part in any of the city's social activities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Oh, please. I mean&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He always eats alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Either in his office or in his quarters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe he has work to do, you know? Some of us are busy people.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shoots McKay a studied look.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sometimes when I walk by his quarters at night, I hear him crying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon chuckles as McKay rolls his eyes and sighs. Woolsey starts to walk by, carrying a covered tray.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mister Woolsey&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She shoots Ronon a look, and he takes down his leg from where it's sprawled over the spare chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling, continuing)<br />
&#8230;Would you, care to join us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, thank you. But I'll be taking breakfast in my quarters today. I still have some final preparations for my impending performance evaluation&#8230;I'm a little apprehensive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You shouldn't be. You've done a wonderful job as our new commander.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, let's hope the IOA agrees.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There you go. He just prefers to be on his own. Speaking of which&#8230;where's Sheppard?</blockquote>
<p>[He looks around, puzzled. Teyla gives a put-upon sigh.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He&#8230;flew some astrobiologists to the mainland this morning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And volunteered to stay with them overnight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(concerned)<br />
What&#8212;he did? Why would he do that?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shoots McKay a look. When McKay shakes his head in ignorance, Ronon gives a more pointed glare.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits, nodding in different places as the attractive female scientist, dressed in shorts, talks to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIANG<br />
This planet's sun is a Class G star. That fact, coupled with its Earth-like atmospheric composition, results in the predominance of green photosynthetic organisms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(faking interest)<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIANG<br />
Chlorophyll, of course, mostly absorbs the sun's blue and red waves while reflecting green ones. "But hang on a minute," you're probably thinking, "That's strange. Why doesn't chlorophyll absorb green light?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, yeah. Weird. Well, why does it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIANG<br />
Well, the answer lies not so much in&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
(yelling from distance)<br />
Oh my God!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stands, instantly alert.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Kiang)<br />
Wait here.</blockquote>
<p>[He runs off. Kiang follows. He finds Parrish standing by a flowering plant in another part of the woods. He's also wearing shorts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
(enthralled)<br />
Look at this. Huh? It's a plant not unlike the <i>begonia eiromischa</i>!</blockquote>
<p>[Kiang looks excited. Sheppard pulls a frown.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh God, Lorne warned me about this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
You don't understand. The wooly-stalked begonia went officially extinct back on Earth back in 2007. And yet, here we are! Standing over a species that's shockingly similar&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Kiang)<br />
I'm going to go back to the jumper and set up for the night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
(continuing)<br />
And it's thriving in a climate that is&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Kiang)<br />
Want to join me?</blockquote>
<p>[Kiang shoots him an incredulous glare.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIANG<br />
(to Parrish)<br />
It's a very unusual find.</blockquote>
<p>[Her attention is solely on Parrish and the begonia.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. Well, knock yourself out. That's what we're here for. Take your time. We're here all night.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard trudges back to the camp. He hears a sudden rustling behind him. He looks over warily, but sees nothing. He raises his weapon, then spins as he hears more movement. He's struck by a stun weapon and falls to the ground, unconscious.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard awakens to find himself bound hand and foot by ropes. He struggles to sit up, his hands held behind him. Noticing a sharp rock, he shuffles over to try and free himself by fraying the rope against the rock.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRANSPORTER</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey reaches to try and hit the touchpad control, but between his papers and his food tray, he can't maneuver.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Can I give you a hand with that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Actually, if you wouldn't mind&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to find an attractive female Australian scientist standing behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(sultry)<br />
Hello.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Hi. Where are you headed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Back to my quarters.</blockquote>
<p>[She looks blankly at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Um, the southeast pier. Level 19.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Ooh. Penthouse suite. Nice.</blockquote>
<p>[She taps the control.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Have we met?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Not yet. I'm Vanessa Conrad.</blockquote>
<p>[She puts out her hand. Woolsey juggles his water bottle to shake it.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Doctor Vanessa Conrad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Richard Woolsey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I just recently arrived on the <i>Apollo</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Oh! Welcome to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Thank you. It's beautiful. And huge. It's probably going to be weeks before I know my way around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Well, I'm sure&#8230;the gang at orientation will help you settle in.</blockquote>
<p>[Conrad smiles, then seems to come to herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I'm sorry. I'm keeping you. Southeast pier&#8230;level nineteen.</blockquote>
<p>[She taps the controls and the doors close.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(talking over her)<br />
Oh. No. Not at all. I have all the time in the&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The transport activates and opens on level nineteen.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
This is you, I believe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Oh. Right. Well&#8230;nice to meet you, Doctor.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey steps out of the transporter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Vanessa.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
You can call me Vanessa.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Very well. Nice to meet you, <i>Vanessa</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Thank you, Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<p>[The doors start to close.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(quickly)<br />
Actually, you can call me&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The doors close before he can finish.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(frustrated)<br />
&#8230;Dick.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard finally gets free. He checks for himself for weapons and, finding none, heads to the jumper. He peeks in, but the ship has been obviously damaged. Smoke and sparks still fly out of the cockpit.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Crap.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on a laptop. Zelenka wanders in, setting down his backpack.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, what happened to your off-world foofaraw? I thought you were the guest of honor at some big diplomatic festival on M2J?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
Yeah, yeah I was, but the festivities ended early when three members of Lieutenant Donovan's team suffered a severe allergic reaction to something that we were served at the grand banquet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disgusted)<br />
Eesh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Come to think of it. I think it might have been those&#8230;little green berries with the-with the purple specks on them. Because my tongue, it did feel a little bit numb afterwards.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, FYI, this conversation ended six seconds ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, um, anyway. On the way back, I had an idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(uninterested)<br />
Well, have a little lie-down. It'll pass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, uh&#8230;you should hear me out.</blockquote>
<p>[He moves so McKay is forced to face him.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I think we should run a scan of the ocean floor. I've been noticing anomalous temperature variations in the waters surrounding the city. I-I think it bears further investigation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Look, we head through the 'gate every day exploring distant worlds. And yet, with the exception of a few marine biology tests, we have barely scratched the surface of the very planet that we occupy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's 'cause there's nothing there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
My point is, is it wouldn't hurt to be thorough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My point is, your point is pointless&#8230;and a giant waste of time.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard tries to work on the sabotaged jumper with a knife, but gets nowhere.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Gah! Dammit.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks outside and looks around, seeing scorch marks on the ground. He heads back into the forest.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey paces, practicing variations of what he will say while waiting for Shen's arrival.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(to himself)<br />
Xiao, welcome&#8230;.Atlantis welcomes you. It is with great pride that I&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Behind him, Shen beams into the Gate Room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
(grinning)<br />
Hello, Richard!</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey hurries forward and shakes her hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Xiao, welcome to Atlantis&#8230;with&#8230;great pride&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
(smiling)<br />
I'm looking forward to the grand tour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well then. Shall we?</blockquote>
<p>[He takes her attach&#233; and hands it to a guard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST CAMP, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard looks around the ransacked camp.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey leads Shen into the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
This is the control room&#8212;for all intents and purposes, the city's nerve center. These technicians are the very best at what they do.<br />
(to Banks)<br />
How's the kickboxing going, Amelia?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Great, sir. Thanks for asking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(to Chuck)<br />
Hello there, Chet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
It's Chuck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
It's Chuck, sir. My name is Chuck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Oh, of course, Chuck. Chet's on the late shift.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Shen move away.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(insulted, to himself)<br />
There is no "Chet."</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and McKay walk down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I think it-it would be a simple matter of reconfiguring the city's short-range sensors in order to achieve a&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, I can see your lips moving, but I'm not hearing any sound.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It would take&#8212;it would take less than an hour to make the necessary adjustments that we would have to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, you know what? If it is <i>so</i> simple and so important to you, why don't you just go ahead and do it yourself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
Because I require your authorization.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You got it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Thank you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[He heads off.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa!</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka pauses.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You realize it's highly unlikely you're actually going to find anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, then I would have wasted an hour of my time, and you'll be able to tell me "I told you so."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
If, on the other hand, I do find something, perhaps they'll name something after me for a change.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay considers this as Zelenka walks off.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey and Shen walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The prospect of commanding the Atlantis expedition was a daunting one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Weir and Colonel Carter were incredibly tough acts to follow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Yet you availed yourself nicely, Richard, and you survived your nine months here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, I'd like to think I've accomplished a little more than mere survival. And I'm certain that once you've had a chance to review my report&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
That won't be necessary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(hopeful)<br />
So, I'm receiving my graduation papers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey sighs in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
In recognition of the great job you've done here, the IOA is appointing you as chair of Earth's new environmental initiative. Congratulations, Richard. You're coming home.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey's face falls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay works at one console while Banks works at another. Zelenka hovers over McKay's nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, short range sensors are good to go. Start the sweep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Sweep initiated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great. So&#8230;it should take about thirty minutes to scan the entire planet, which means I've got plenty of time to get down to the cafeteria, get myself some of that fine almond biscotti and a Yoo-hoo, and be back in time for you to tell me you have found nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[Banks's computer beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
We've found something.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Zelenka exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, of course we did.</blockquote>
<p>[They approach the display next to Banks.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Whatever it is, it's sitting approximately fifteen hundred feet below sea level.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard spots a Genii soldier lying in wait but not noticing Sheppard. He sneaks up behind the soldier, his knife out, but as he approaches, the man disappears. He hears something behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Hello, John.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at him, confused.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(weakly)<br />
Kolya?</blockquote>
<p>[He spins around just as the other soldier cold-cocks him.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits, staring in shock. Shen stands nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
I don't understand your reaction. Nine months ago, you were dreading coming over here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
A lot has changed in nine months. I like it here. And quite frankly, I don't like the idea of leaving a job unfinished. I've done good work. My record speaks for itself. What's really going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
The IOA is concerned about some of the decisions you've made&#8212;decisions that have run counter to protocol, and quite frankly, common sense. They&#8230;<i>we</i> feel that the demands of this position have compromised your position, and it's time for a change.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[A technician wheels in a strange cylindrical device on a cart. McKay and Zelenka are standing, waiting.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right here. That'll do.</blockquote>
<p>[The technician leaves the cart and departs.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I wonder how long it's been down there. To think it would've remained undiscovered if we hadn't have&#8230; Nice job on reconfiguring the short-range sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you. Nice job on the&#8230;wild guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Shall we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay picks up a scanner while Zelenka shines a flashlight on the device.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is again tied up and has been sat up against a tree. Kolya stands nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(on radio)<br />
Keep looking. There's nowhere for them to go, they're scientists. Trust me, they don't run very fast.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Oh you're awake. Save your energy; you're not getting away this time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I killed you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You shot me. There's a difference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. I killed you. Beckett confirmed it. You were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Yeah, I'm sure that's what he thought. Let's just say your friend&#8212;what was his name? Lucius?&#8212;he wasn't the only one using Ancient technology that day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How'd you get here? How'd you find us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Turns out some of your off-world contacts aren't as trustworthy as you think. Your secret's out, Sheppard. A half day's walk in that direction will bring us to the edge of the mainland. I figure, it'll take us maybe&#8230;two days to reach Atlantis by boat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You won't even get to the city. They're going to blow you out of the water.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
No. They won't even see us coming. They'll be too busy counting their dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you going to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Send an explosive through your 'gate, cripple the city's defenses. But for that, I'm going to need something from you. I think you call it&#8230;an IDC.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts on leather gloves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go to hell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Yeah. I thought you would need some convincing.</blockquote>
<p>[He punches Sheppard in the face. Sheppard spits blood.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey, now alone, stares at himself in a mirror. He holds up a suit, complete with tie, then lowers it to look at himself in the Atlantis uniform. The door chimes. He goes to answer it. Conrad stands there.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Conrad. Vanessa. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I hope I'm not intruding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Not at all. What brings you by?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
This may be wholly inappropriate, but I was wondering whether you'd like to catch a movie.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
A movie?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
They're screening two of my favorites tonight: <i>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" and </i>Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels<i>.</blockquote></i>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Truth be told&#8230;I'm having a horrible day, and I'm not in much of a laughing mood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Oh. Then when we can wait until tomorrow when they'll be screening <i>Mad Money</i> and <i>Kangaroo Jack</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey gives a wan smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Is it&#8230;something you'd like to talk about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It seems the time for talk has passed. I've just been informed that I'm being relieved of my command here on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I'm sorry. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Apparently, I'm not very good at towing the company line. I assumed I got this position on the strength of my record, but now it's clear that the only reason they appointed me is because they expected I would just&#8230;roll over for them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Then don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Don't roll over for them. Fight this.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Knowing they couldn't save themselves, they spent their final days creating the means to start over. They built seed carriers, each with a different target world programmed into its navigation system. Worlds that would provide them with the chemical compounds necessary to produce, sustain, and develop life.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Each seed carrier also held a repository containing the history of the Sekkari people &#8212;their struggles, their achievements, and the mistakes that ultimately led to their own destruction.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
The seed carriers were outfitted with subspace communicators, designed to alert the group once a seeding was successful. Over fifty were launched. None achieved their goal.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
This unit malfunctioned. I guided it to the nearest planet&#8212;this world, in the hope that it would prove suitable to the life-forming process.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
It wasn't. This device survived reentry relatively unscathed, then spent the next two thousand years at the ocean's bottom&#8230;until recently, when its dormant systems were awakened by its sensors picking up trace readings from one of your submerged puddle jumpers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The one Doctor McKay flew up out of the underwater bay several weeks ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I scanned your city, and I linked with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I'm the seed carrier's artificial intelligence. My aim was to study you, to get to know you, and eventually, direct you to help complete this unit's assignment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
By manipulating me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
No! By finding out what kind of person you are in the hope that we could place our trust in you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Couldn't you have simply communicated your situation to us from the beginning?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Please understand, I am the last hope of the Sekkari people. I couldn't risk it. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
As a soldier, you were a threat. If anyone was to use force to secure the repository, it would've been you, the military man. So I&#8230;connected with your mind to distract you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Distract me? Making me think the jumper'd been sabotaged would've been enough of a distraction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You would've discovered the subterfuge. I'm unable to maintain a static illusion over time. It was necessary to keep your mind&#8230;occupied.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(bitter)<br />
And that's what you chose?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
What <i>you</i> chose. I didn't have full control over your hallucination, or the direction it took. It was your mind driving the diversion. I merely played along.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're saying I tortured myself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You torture yourself every day, John. But in this case, it was your mind manifesting your darkest fears. You were the architect of your own self-deception.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at Kolya in shock.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Now you know the truth. And have a decision to make.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Parrish stands where he and Kiang have been waiting next to the puddle jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
Colonel, where were you? Do you know how long we've been sitting here wait&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shut up. Get in the jumper.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard doesn't break stride as he storms into the jumper. The scientists gather their equipment and follow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEN'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Shen types up Woolsey's evaluation on her laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Sorry to disturb you, Ms. Shen, but you've just received a secure transmission from Earth. Can I patch it through?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[Shen closes her program and pulls up the video-link. Luthor Dovelock appears on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Luthor. How are things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOVELOCK<br />
(via video)<br />
Well, but I felt it only fair to inform you of recent developments here. As much as I believe you'd be a worthy candidate to replace Richard Woolsey, I'm afraid the rest of the council feels otherwise. It looks like we'll be going with&#8230;James Coolidge instead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
(outraged)<br />
Coolidge?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DOVELOCK<br />
(over vid-link)<br />
Don't worry. You'll still be rewarded for facilitating the transition. Congratulations. You'll be chairing the IOA's new environmental initiative.</blockquote>
<p>[Shen slams her laptop shut.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Shen wheels her suitcase into the Gate Room and stands next to Woolsey as the Stargate dials. Banks stands next to Woolsey]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Well&#8230;I'm off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I suppose I'll be joining you shortly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
Don't make any holiday plans. You're not going anywhere. I gave you a glowing review. And since your future rests entirely on my report, I'd like to be the first to congratulate you as the new permanent commander of the Atlantis expedition.</blockquote>
<p>[She shakes a nonplussed Woolsey's hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I don't understand&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEN<br />
(smiling)<br />
Like you, Richard, I'm nobody's puppet. They should've thought of that before delivering yesterday's update. Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves through the Stargate, and it shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(to Banks)<br />
Yesterday's update?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
I don't know what she's talking about, sir. We haven't had a scheduled dial-out in days.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey looks over and sees Conrad standing nearby, smiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Could I have a moment alone, Amelia?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Banks leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I assume that you're responsible for that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
(smug)<br />
Consider it a going away present.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard wheel in the device. Sheppard glares at Conrad, but manages a wan, brief smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Alrighty. Here we are, all fixed up and ready to roll.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
So what happens to you when you reach your final destination?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Destination? Um&#8230;you're talking to the A.I., aren't you? Uh&#8230;uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay moves out of the way&#8212;where he'd been standing in front of Conrad.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
I'll start the process that will give life to the Sekkari, and then I'll go to sleep until a time when I'm needed again.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
John, I realize it may have been an unpleasant experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Yeah, well&#8230;just a little bit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wha&#8212;you can see her, too?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
And I want you to know, I'm sorry for what you had to go through.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives a weak nod, still looking haunted.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(from control room balcony)<br />
The <i>Apollo</i> is ready to beam.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The ship will take you to your target planet.</blockquote>
<p>[Conrad nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
I'm sorry. You know, I don't mean to complain or anything. It's just that, you know, I have spent the better part of a day making sure this was in working order. It would be kinda nice just to, you know, get a little face time with the&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts as he can now see Conrad.]
</p>
<blockquote>CONRAD<br />
Here you are, Doctor McKay. The true form of the Sekkari.</blockquote>
<p>[Conrad transforms into the Sekkari natural form, a skeletal, silvery humanoid form.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awed)<br />
Neat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(wistful)<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[The device is beamed away. Conrad's form dissolves a few moments later. Sheppard and McKay walk away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Neat?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? I&#8230;she caught me off-guard. What did you want me to say? What would you have said?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, weird.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey smiles to himself.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey carries his tray through the mess hall. Teyla notices as he passes by her team's table, where all four of them are seated.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mister Woolsey. Would you&#8230;care to join us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, actually I have some reports to file&#8230; Thank you. I'd love to join you.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs a nearby chair and sits with the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, you really had no idea that what you were seeing wasn't real?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Trust me. The manifestations were very convincing, Doctor. You wouldn't have known.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smug)<br />
Well, with all due respect, I think they knew they couldn't "fool me", so they, you know, didn't bother. They just&#8230;concentrated on you two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know what I don't get? Is the A.I. thing revealed itself that morning; you discovered the device that afternoon. I mean, that's perfect timing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The colonel's right. That was very coincidental.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And I know what you're implying, all right? But my mind was clear. All right, that device was found because of my brilliant thinking, and, as much as I hate to admit it, a little help from Zelenka.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about? Zelenka's off-world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(snide)<br />
No, he's not. He came back yesterday.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon exchanges looks with the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lieutenant Donovan had a nasty reaction to something he ate? They came back early&#8230;didn't they?</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at him with dawning amusement.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, son of a&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Guess it wasn't so much of a coincidence after all.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey chuckles and slaps McKay on the shoulder sympathetically. Disturbed, McKay stops eating.]
