<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Scenes from 4.19 "Kindred Part 2", 4.20 "The Last Man", and 5.01 "Search and Rescue" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla enters the infirmary, carrying Torren. Keller works at her computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good afternoon, Doctor Keller.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller gets up and heads to Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How's my newest patient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Today, he's decided that he will only sleep as long as I hold him, and keep moving. I've already walked half the city and back again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
My parents used to put me in the car. My dad would have to drive around and round and round the block at three o'clock in the morning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mmmm. That would be lovely. At least I'd be sitting down. I wanted to thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
For what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I saw Kanaan today.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How's he doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Much better. He is himself once again in every way. In fact, I'm going to request that he and many of the others be allowed to return to the city&#8230;as soon as Mister Woolsey arrives on the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I still can't believe Sam's not coming back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is difficult.</blockquote>
<p>[There is a pause.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, anyway, is wasn't me that cured Kanaan and the other hybrids. It was Doctor Beckett's retrovirus. And you could thank him in person if I could just get my head around all this Wraith medical data.</blockquote>
<p>[She shows Teyla her computer screen, which scrolls Wraith data.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You believe the answer's in there somewhere?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We know he was giving Carson a serum to keep his internal organs from deteriorating, and I think I might have found the formula. I just&#8230;need to be sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, at least we know he's safe for the moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Technically, yeah. I just hate the thought of him being stuck in that box.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You know, Rodney goes to visit him? Stands in front of the stasis pod and tells him all the latest news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Mm-hmm. I walked in on him once by accident, and he pretended like he was "checking the system" or something.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(thoughtfully)<br />
He surprises me sometimes.</blockquote>
<p>[The baby starts to fuss.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, this is me once again being recalled to duty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Have a nice walk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Don't worry, Jennifer. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla leaves. Keller wipes her eyes and gets back to work.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The control room is fully staffed, including McKay. Sheppard enters the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Sir, <i>Daedalus</i> just jumped out of hyperspace. We're receiving a signal. He's coming down.</blockquote>
<p>[She stands at ease next to Sheppard. The other technicians follow suit. McKay remains slumped over his computer. Sheppard shoots him a look, and McKay reluctantly stands too. Woolsey beams into the room. Sheppard walks over and shakes his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mister Woolsey, welcome back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Thank you, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[He clears his throat officiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(to everyone)<br />
Well then&#8230;<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
I think I'll start by going over copies of all your latest reports. Yours as well, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What, right now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I've been out of touch on the <i>Daedalus</i> for three weeks. I'd like to be brought up to speed as quickly as possible. We can have a full briefing in the morning.<br />
(to Banks)<br />
Please have the rest of my things sent directly to my quarters.</blockquote>
<p>[He quickly heads to his new office.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sarcastic, under his breath)<br />
Nice speech. Very inspiring.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller is asleep, her head cradled in her arms next to her computer. She awakens to find a slimy substance covering her hand. She looks around but sees nothing to cause it.]
</p><p>[She washes her hand in the sink, repeatedly wiping her hands with a paper towel. Behind her, Marie and a technician arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
All right, let's do one more series. See if we can get the results to normalize a little.</blockquote>
<p>[Their voices startle Keller. The technician moves away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Doctor, you're still here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, yeah. I&#8230;fell asleep at my desk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Well, if you don't mind me saying, I think you're pushing yourself a little hard. You should take it easy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I know. I'm&#8230;going to turn in now.</blockquote>
<p>[She continues to wipe at her hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(abruptly)<br />
Yeah, I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(defensively)<br />
Okay, 'night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(primly)<br />
'Night.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon gather around a new large conference table. The semicircle of smaller tables is gone. Keller and McKay are by the coffee carafes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did you get <i>any</i> sleep last night?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Do I really look that bad?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(hurriedly)<br />
Uh, no, no, of course not. That's not what I meant. Uh, it's really&#8230;it's a lovely&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes her seat. Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wow. New table, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Woolsey brought it with him. He said he wanted a little piece of home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A twelve foot long mahogany conference table, hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't get it. I thought Colonel Carter was doing a good job.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I agree. We defeated the Replicators; we thwarted Michael's plans; and the Wraith are in a state of disarray. All of this happened while she was leader of Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's the problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, she's a victim of her own success. Now that the threat level is down, the IOA is going to jump at the chance to put a civilian back in command.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's not just that. I mean, Sam didn't exactly stick to protocol.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Neither did Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, so for four years, they've been waiting to get someone in who will finally do things their way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, I still don't get it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Colonel, when you were in the future, and you learned all those things that were going to happen, wasn't this one of them? Woolsey taking over?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the circumstances were, uh, different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, still, it is a little unsettling. I mean, maybe it's harder to change the course of events than we thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I wouldn't worry about it. I mean, uh, the fact that Sheppard's here makes all the difference, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Woolsey wasn't the weirdest thing about that timeline.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks between McKay and Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(after a pause)<br />
Never mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey enters, dropping his large folder on the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, I see everyone's here. Let's get started.</blockquote>
<p>[The door closes behind him, startling Woolsey.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Hmm. First of all, I'd like to congratulate all of you on the success you've had dismantling what's left of Michael's organization.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Except one thing&#8230;we haven't found him yet.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey checks his file.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, he was on the cruiser you destroyed in orbit around M2S-445.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's a chance he may have made it off the ship.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey pulls out a page.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Right. You're referring to this statement given by one of Michael's ex-mercenaries claiming to have seen him alive recently.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's what he said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
This is one unsubstantiated report from a highly unreliable source.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, someone stole our jumper off that ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I thought you needed Ancient DNA to pilot one of those?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not necessarily. We've developed a gene therapy that works&#8230;some of the time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. If there is even a chance that he is still alive, me must continue the search.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'm sorry. But I can't devote the resources of this base to the never-ending pursuit of a single individual across an entire galaxy. Even if I knew for a fact he were still alive, I still wouldn't authorize it unless you have some new, credible evidence as to his whereabouts. Do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey shuts one folder with a determined thump.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Then for the time being, I shall consider the matter&#8230;closed. As to these prisoner hybrids, I understand they're being held in a camp on the mainland?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
And how is their rehabilitation progressing?</blockquote>
<p>[They all look to Keller, who's daydreaming.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller is startled and looks around, trying to gather her thoughts.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh, right, uh&#8230;well, um, we've had some success using a slightly modified version of the original retrovirus that created Michael in the first place. It weeds out the Wraith DNA, and allows them to resume their original human form over time.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey makes notes.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Without any lasting ill-effects?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
None that we've detected so far. No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(hopefully)<br />
Many have already completed the treatment. They're wondering when they might be released.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(narrowly)<br />
These people are victims, Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Maybe so, but until very recently, they were also enemy-combatants.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Fine, well then we'll just keep them there forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(firmly)<br />
No. We'll keep them there until I'm satisfied that they can be trusted. Now&#8230;regarding the situation with our friend in the stasis pod. You seem to have been giving a significant amount of attention to this lately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, once we got our hands on Michael's medical research, I thought I should make it a priority to look for a solution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
And have you found one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(pleased)<br />
Maybe. We found a serum that, in lab tests at least, seems to be capable of stabilizing the clone cells.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks around, surprised.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
So what's the problem?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Carson was near death when we put him in that chamber. I don't want to take him out until I know for sure. But, lab tests can only do so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
But that problem's never going to go away, is it?  If you've reached the limit of what your research can tell you, then you need to make a decision. Either proceed, or put the matter aside and get back to your regular duty. Right?</blockquote>
<p>[Wide eyed, Keller nods. Woolsey sets aside another file.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS STASIS CHAMBER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett is encased in a stasis chamber. Keller, McKay, and two medics are by the chamber with a gurney.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
You sure about this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(uncertain)<br />
No. But we're never going to be sure unless we give it a shot. If we don't take a chance now, he could be in there forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(resigned)<br />
All right, then.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay uses his computer to deactivate the stasis chamber. It shuts off and the medics catch the unconscious Beckett as he collapses.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Get him on the gurney! Careful!</blockquote>
<p>[The medics lay him down. Keller injects him with the serum.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[She nods to the medics, who wheel him away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Now we take him to the infirmary and watch for signs for more cellular degradation. We should know soon enough.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett lies sleeping on a bed. Sheppard's team surrounds him. He slowly opens his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey there. How you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Fine. What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what do you think? We-we thawed you out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(grinning)<br />
It's nice to see you again, Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, what's up, Doc? It's been a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. How long was I in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ah, two months, give or take.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Did I miss anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know. Just the usual.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller arrives, carrying a tablet computer that she hands to Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I've got good news. At the moment, you're showing no signs of cellular degradation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You were able to&#8230;recreate the treatment?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks smug.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(smiling)<br />
That's right. I'll&#8230;let them tell you about it.</blockquote>
<p>[She moves away. Sheppard follows, stopping her at the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, Doc. Um, nice work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, it's not a permanent solution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's good enough for now. Go get some rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, I think that might be a&#8230;good idea.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KELLER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Keller takes some pills before turning out the lights and getting into bed.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay joins Beckett on the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Gorgeous, isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
I&#8230;suppose so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You know, I really did miss this place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(uncomfortably)<br />
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's that supposed to mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I just found out, they're sending you back to Earth. There's a&#8212;a scheduled dial-out this afternoon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, well. I suppose it's to be expected. I mean, even with these injections, I imagine it'll still be months before I'm&#8230;in any sort of decent physical condition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney, this is Teyla, come in, please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
I'm sorry to bother you, but I need your help.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, OUTSIDE KELLER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Beckett arrive and join Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's Doctor Keller. She was supposed to join me for breakfast this morning, but she did not show up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, maybe she's sleeping in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I assumed as much as well, and decided not to disturb her. However that was four hours ago. She's now late for her shift, and she's not responding to radio calls.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you want me to do about it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Override the door controls.</blockquote>
<p>[She holds out a tablet computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not breaking into her room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, there might be something wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Fine, but if she's just in there sleeping&#8230;or naked, or something, you guys are taking the blame.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs the computer and works with the door controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh for god sakes, Rodney. Hurry up.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shoots Beckett a look.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KELLER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[The room is still darkened when the door opens.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Jennifer, are you all right? Jennifer?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett hurries in.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She must be unconscious.</blockquote>
<p>[He checks her eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Pupils dilated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(concerned)<br />
Carson, step away from the bed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sharply)<br />
Step away, now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rips away the covers to show a mass of tendrils covering Keller's abdomen and stretching past the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Dear lord.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
John, we have a problem.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not sure. This is how we found her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It must've happened last night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've seen something like this before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
One of Michael's labs. He was conducting some kind of experiment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we've got to get it off her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not so certain that's such a good idea. From what I can tell, the tendrils are attached to her and the bed-frame. If we just start ripping her off, we could cause her serious injury.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we can't just leave her like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We need to get her into an isolation chamber, and take the whole bed as well. That way we can run a full examination and see what we're dealing with here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard briefs Woolsey as they move swiftly down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
These things are actually growing out of her body?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what it looks like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Is she conscious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Beckett says her brain activity is consistent with somebody in a coma.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Beckett is not on active duty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He was the first one there. And he says he's seen something like this before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
While he was a prisoner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He was forced to work with Michael for two years. Nobody knows this stuff better than he does.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves Woolsey behind.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team and Woolsey watch monitors that show Beckett and a medical team wearing full hazmat gear in an isolation room. They are performing surgery on Keller.]
</p><p><i>[The scene continuously changes between the control room and the isolation room.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over intercom)<br />
I'm going to try to cut some of the thinner strands.<br />
(to nurse)<br />
Scalpel. Thank you&#8230;there we go. Nurse?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
No change.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to surgical nurse)<br />
Get that analyzed right away.</blockquote>
<p>[The nurse leaves with the specimen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
Doctor, blood pressure's dropping. Pulse as well.</blockquote>

(to Banks)<br />
Cut power to the transporter.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MEDICAL BUILDING CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The transporter power shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
How does it look?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not so good. The stuff's everywhere.</blockquote>
<p>[Tendrils cover the entire area between the transporter and the isolation chamber.]
</p><p><i>[The conversation continues between the control room and Ronon's location.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Is it reacting to your presence in any way?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
All right, just&#8230;be careful.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard regains consciousness. McKay is there, pacing. Sheppard is no longer in restraints.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It worked. They just sent Ronon in to give her the shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
When?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He just got there. Look, I'm tapped into their intercom.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands Sheppard a radio. Sheppard stands up and takes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Ronon, what's your status?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, NEAR ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon continues to work his way through the area, dodging tendrils.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, it's getting harder to move. There's too much of it.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation continues between the control room and Ronon's location, as well as the listening McKay and Sheppard in the infirmary.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Just try not to make any sudden moves, or&#8230;threatening gestures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(dryly)<br />
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.</blockquote>
<p>[He works his way a few feet more.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right, that's it. I don't think I can go any further. The corridor is completely blocked. All right, so what do you want me to do?</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey looks to the others. Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Screw it, I'm going to make a hole.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls out his anti-Wraith gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ronon, wait! The only reason you made it this far is because it senses the pathogen in your bloodstream. It thinks you're a friend. If you start shooting&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Does anyone have any better ideas?</blockquote>
<p>[No one in the control room answers.]
</p><p>[In the infirmary, Sheppard goes to the table and picks up a syringe filled with the phage.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If I'm right, this is about to go very, very wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You-you can't&#8230;we're quarantined.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm cured, remember?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rushes out.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
There's no other way through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Once you start shooting, you'll have to move quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thanks for the advice.</blockquote>
<p>[He shoots several times. The shots can be heard in the control room. Ronon then uses a sword to slice his way past the tendrils. After a few feet, one of the tendrils grabs his sword arm, another captures his other arm, and he is pinned to the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Ronon? Ronon, what's your status? Ronon come in!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh my god!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon cries out in pain as the tendrils wrap around his neck.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard arrives in the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Eh, we've lost contact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, turn the power back on. Open up a channel to the isolation room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(impatient)<br />
Just do it!</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka looks to Woolsey, who nods. Zelenka taps some keys.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right, you have a channel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Doctor Keller, this is Colonel Sheppard, do you read?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER-ENTITY<br />
(voice distorted, over radio)<br />
I hear you, Colonel, but I am not Doctor Keller anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER-ENTITY<br />
(over radio)<br />
I have no designation yet. I'll be given one when I'm complete.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
What about Ronon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER-ENTITY<br />
(over radio)<br />
You mean, the intruder? He's alive&#8230;for the moment. He's been neutralized. I can feel his pulse. It's weak. It would only take the slightest squeeze.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The tendrils tighten around Ronon's throat.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard checks the phage syringe.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but you don't want to do that, because, uh, he's one of you, remember?<br />
(to others)<br />
Keep her talking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Where you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going to go finish this.</blockquote>
<p>[He heads up the stairs to the jumper bay.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Jennifer, this is Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER-ENTITY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Doctor Beckett, I already told you I'm not Jennifer Keller anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
You're the voice she was hearing&#8212;the part of her mind that was taken over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER-ENTITY<br />
(over radio)<br />
You can't stop me. I will become as I was meant to be.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters a jumper and starts it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Colonel Sheppard is powering up a jumper!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Get me a secure channel.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm taking a little shortcut. Sorry I didn't have time to fill out the paperwork.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A jumper flies out of the bay and through the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard flies towards the medical building. The entity is spread across the building.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Okay, I see it now. That stuff is growing all over the place. This may hurt.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard crashes the jumper directly into the wall of tendrils covering building.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, report. Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[A dazed Sheppard climbs out of the pilot's seat and heads to the back. He grabs a pistol and loads it. He also grabs the syringe and opens the door.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MEDICAL BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[The jumper has crashed through several rooms; open air is visible through the hole. Sheppard heads towards the isolation room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters the room. He reaches an unconscious Keller and injects her. After a few moments, Keller inhales deeply and her eyes open. The tendrils spasm.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon struggles to breathe as the tendrils there also react to the injection.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is impaled by one of the whipping tendrils. He falls to his knees, but is able to keep his wits about him enough to raise his pistol. He aims at Keller, who suddenly collapses, relaxed and unconscious. The tendrils stop moving. Sheppard lowers his gun and starts to keel over.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon is released by the tendrils. He falls to the floor, gasping for breath before falling unconscious.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(into radio, more anxious)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, breathing hard, weakly)<br />
Wha&#8212;I've been better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(over radio)<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, gasping)<br />
You'd better come get us.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is lying in a hospital bed, wearing scrubs. Woolsey stands by his bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's Ronon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
He has a bruised larynx. Apparently, he won't be able to speak for several days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I wonder if anyone will notice the difference.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Keller arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(proudly)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, look who's finally out of isolation!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller smiles sheepishly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, it's good to see you, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It only hurts when I breathe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I feel really bad. It looks like my recovery's going to be a lot easier than yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's all right. I've got two doctors looking after me now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, no, I'm afraid not. I'm scheduled to leave this afternoon. That is, unless of course, there's a major crisis in the next hour or so?</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey gives a thin, but amused smile, and Keller chuckle slightly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm, it wouldn't surprise me.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett chuckles wryly.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, listen you keep yourself out of trouble. And I'll see you real soon.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Sheppard shake hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good luck, Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thanks, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Welcome back, Doctor Keller. And Doctor Beckett, thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Woolsey shake hands as Keller heads away. She hangs back to wait for Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
My pleasure, Mister Woolsey.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett joins Keller and they move to another part of the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Before I came down here, I was on a call with my superiors back on Earth. They were going over my preliminary report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What'd you tell them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The truth. That in my first three days as commander&#8230;I violated at least half a dozen basic security protocols.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(innocently)<br />
That many, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I let Beckett run the investigation, in spite of his condition and the fact that he's technically no longer a member of this expedition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm&#8230;.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I sent Ronon to deliver the antidote, even though he was infected. I compromised the safety of this base to rescue someone who may well have been beyond our help anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(punctuating with his finger)<br />
But she wasn't, and we got her out. And if you had played by rules, she'd be dead right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The IOA would seem to agree with you. Apparently, they're&#8230;willing to let the matter drop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So what's the problem?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The rules are there for a reason, Colonel. If I can't trust them, then&#8230;I'm not sure I can do this job.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard studies him, then sticks out his hand. Woolsey shakes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Welcome to the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<p>[They smile lightly at each other.]
