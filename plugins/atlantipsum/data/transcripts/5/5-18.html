<p>An Ancient device on another planet causes Dr. Keller to swap bodies with a woman named Neeva, who hides her true identity from the Atlantis expedition. Once they realize what has happened, Sheppard’s team, with Dr. Carson Beckett along, must find and deactivate the device that caused the body swap. They must rescue Keller from people who believe she is Neeva, and who have troubles of their own.<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_5.18_%22Identity%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 5.18 &quot;Identity&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, EAST PIER, LEVEL FOUR</b>
</p><p>[A woman wearing a medical striped Atlantis uniform looks confusedly around. She hears voices approaching and is startled, ducking into a nearby room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;AUXILIARY LAB, EAST PIER</b>
</p><p>[She stares blankly around at the computer equipment and schematics. Zelenka enters, carrying a tray of food.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh. I didn't know anybody was in here. Huh.</blockquote>
<p>[The woman, Neeva, makes a nervous noncommittal sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Are you looking for, um, Rodney? 'Cause I saw him in the mess hall.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(blankly)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yup. Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You just seem a little&#8230;confused.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to work at a computer, then notices her nervous fidgeting and wary glances. He approaches her.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(concerned)<br />
Are you ill?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No. No, no, no, I just&#8230;I don't&#8230;where am I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You're in one of our auxiliary labs&#8230;East Pier, Level Four?</blockquote>
<p>[She just looks scared and continues to fidget.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(solicitous)<br />
Here. Wh-why don't you sit down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
It's okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, really. I mean, I'll radio Rodney and I'll just&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(quickly)<br />
No, no. You don't need to do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(soothingly)<br />
Better yet, let&#8230;why don't you lie down? Walk with me to the infirmary and&#8230;they'll examine you. They'll just see if there's anything&#8230;.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka takes her gently by the arm and while she nods he starts to lead her away. She grabs a pair of pliers on a shelf as they pass and stabs Zelenka in his lower right abdomen. He gasps in pain and collapses.]
</p><p>[Neeva, gets a glimpse of herself in a mirror on the wall. The reflection is Keller's. She touches her face, studying her altered appearance in confusion before leaving the lab. Zelenka makes a croaking noise as he lies half-unconscious on the floor, bleeding.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Neeva walks around the crowded corridor, trying not to catch anyone's eye.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[She stares around, watching a puddle jumper fly by. She takes the bloody pliers out from where she has it hidden up her sleeve and drops it over the balcony side. She starts to head back in, but her reflection in the glass window stops her. She stares, frightened, at Keller looking back at her. McKay comes up behind her, startling her when he speaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There you are. I've been looking all over for you. What, is your radio not working? I called like a thousand times!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Um&#8230;I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, here&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches for her ear, and she instinctively grabs his arm in a defensive movement.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just want to check your earwig. Here we go.</blockquote>
<p>[She lets him continue, and he gently pulls off her radio earpiece.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There we go. It's probably just a dead battery. Come on, it's schnitzel day. We've got to hurry though, 'cause it's going fast.</blockquote>
<p>[She follows him back out of the balcony.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So what happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, hello? Our lunch date? You were supposed to meet me like, half an hour ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I must've forgotten.</blockquote>
<p>[He stops walking, and she follows suit.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey. What's wrong? You seem distracted. Is something bothering you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No—</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(interrupting)<br />
Did I do something? Oh, I did, didn't I? What did I do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Nothing. I'm just&#8230;I'm not&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The earpiece in McKay's hand activates, the tinny voice audible to them both.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(frantic, over radio)<br />
Doctor Keller? Doctor Keller, please respond!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay purses his lips, piqued, and swings the earpiece before raising the microphone to his mouth.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Just a second.<br />
(handing radio to Neeva)<br />
It's for you. Working fine, apparently.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva struggles for a moment, figuring out how to put the radio back on.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Uh&#8230;hello?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Doctor Keller, we have an emergency! Doctor Zelenka has been seriously injured!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Doctor Zelenka?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(impatiently activating his own radio)<br />
What's wrong with Zelenka? Is he complaining about another one of his so-called migraines? 'Cause if he is, you can send him right down to the&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(interrupting, over radio)<br />
He's been stabbed!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, stabbed? What do you mean stabbed? Like, with a knife stabbed? By who?</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva nervously looks behind her to see if there's a way to escape but an armed German security member is taking a patrol position there.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(over intercom)<br />
I don't know. An S.O. just radioed us. They found him on the floor of his lab. He's unconscious, losing a lot of blood. They're rushing him to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, we're on our way!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rushes off. Neeva nervously follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Marie and others work on Zelenka. McKay and Neeva enter. They're met by Marie.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
His pressure's dropping, sixty over forty. Pulse rapid, skin diaphoretic. The scan shows internal bleeding, laceration of the liver.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
So&#8230;so what? Is he going to die?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
He needs immediate surgery. He's in hypovolemic shock.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva stares at the staff working on the man she stabbed, seeing he's unconscious and pale.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(prompting)<br />
Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Yes. Yes. He needs surgery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
We're prepping the O.R. Doctor McBride will assist you. He's already scrubbing. We'll be all set to go as soon as you're ready.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva starts to hyperventilate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sounding like from a distance)<br />
Jennifer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(loudly)<br />
Jennifer!</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva snaps out of it, looking at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're acting weird. What's wrong with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Nothing. Nothing. I need to get ready.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks away, Marie leading her to the scrub room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD</b>
</p><p>[Marie and the rest of the surgical staff are all in scrubs and ready to start. McKay watches from observation. Neeva nervously comes over to the operating table. Marie hands the scalpel to her. Neeva stares at a monitor recording the surgery, seeing Keller on the video screen where she is standing.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIE<br />
(concerned)<br />
Doctor?</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva takes a shaky breath, then lowers her face mask.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I'm not feeling very well. Take over for me. I'm going to go lay down.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at each other, confused, as Neeva walks away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WOOLSEY'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey sits at his desk, looking at his laptop. Sheppard and McKay enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
How'd it go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They've managed to stop the bleeding, but he's lost a lot of blood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Is he awake yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, he's in a coma.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a light coma. I mean, they figure he should recover, barring any, you know, complications.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
I hear Doctor Keller didn't perform the surgery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, she&#8230;excused herself&#8212;said she wasn't feeling well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What's wrong with her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you got me. I mean she's been acting strange all day&#8212;aloof, distracted. I found her wandering Atlantis looking lost. You know, I got her to the infirmary, but she just stood there like she'd never held a scalpel before.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey stiffens in his chair, alert, then shifts.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Where is she now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's in her quarters, resting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Beckett is due back soon. I'll have him examine her for any possible contagion or, God forbid, another one of those parasitic organisms. Better safe than sorry. Any leads yet as to who might have done this to Doctor Zelenka?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No witnesses. No sign of a struggle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I want a full investigation. Use every resource, no stone unturned. One of our people is lying in a coma&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(quietly)<br />
Light coma.</blockquote>
<p>[He stammers into silence.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
&#8230;and I want to know who's responsible.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;KELLER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Neeva rummages through Keller's personal belongings. She finds a graduation picture of Keller and her father. She stares at it, then at the full length mirror in the room at Keller's reflection of her.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(low, to herself)<br />
What the hell's going on here?</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens behind her, Ronon leaning in the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey. Heard you weren't feeling well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[There is an awkward silence.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Can I come in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So. What's wrong with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I don't know. I'm just&#8230;tired?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(nodding, but suspicious)<br />
Been pushing yourself real hard lately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Yes. Well, uh, you know me. I'm always pushing myself real hard.</blockquote>
<p>[She shoots him a nervous smile. Ronon studies her.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(defensively)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(smiling falsely)<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Anyway, I'll be fine. I just need to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stiffly)<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn to see McKay in the still open doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Am I&#8230;interrupting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters, pleased. Ronon sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good. I mean um&#8230;I just dropped by to let you know that uh&#8230;Beckett is on his way back. He'll be able to fill in for you while you're, um&#8230;ill.</blockquote>
<p>[He continues to shoot glances between Ronon and Neeva as he stands beside Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, we've, uh, sent a puddle jumper for him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(blankly)<br />
A puddle jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Well, he's in some remote desert village. It'll take too long to walk back to the 'gate, so it's easier to, you know, just hitch a ride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(parroting)<br />
A ride on a puddle jumper.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stares at Neeva, almost with hostility.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled at her reaction)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Ronon exchange looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe we should leave. You know, let her get some rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva smiles. Ronon leaves first. McKay lingers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Call me&#8230;if you need anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I will.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves, and the doors close.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Neeva lies on the scanner bed as it runs its test. Beckett stands nearby with McKay and Woolsey. As the scan finishes, Neeva sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Nothing out of the usual. No sign of trauma or any kind of organism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What about her blood work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The same.<br />
(to Neeva)<br />
How long have you been feeling like this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Um&#8230;a day or so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Have you been sleeping all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No. I've been pushing myself real hard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. Well, I'd like to keep you overnight for observation. I'll give you something to help you sleep, and we'll monitor your condition. Then hopefully you'll wake up in the morning refreshed&#8212;back to your old self, okay?</blockquote>
<p>[He smiles at her and pats her on the leg, then steps away.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You're certain you saw nothing at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She's fine&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He lowers his voice as they step into a storage area of the infirmary with McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
&#8230;physically speaking. If there's something wrong with her, I'm afraid it's most likely psychological in nature.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Neeva lies on a bed wearing hospital scrubs. A staff member walks by. When the coast is clear, Neeva sneaks out of bed, pulls open a drawer and grabs her clothes.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Neeva is still pulling on her jacket as she spots a technician working at a junction console.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(with charming smile)<br />
Hello. All these corridors, I keep getting turned around. The puddle jumper is&#8230;where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
The jumper bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Top of the central tower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Right. Yeah. I know that. I just need to, um&#8230;how do I&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Oh. The transporter's at the end of the corridor. it'll take you there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Transporter. Of course. Thank you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
You're welcome.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Neeva exits a transporter directly into the jumper bay, seeing several parked jumpers.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[She enters one parked jumper and sorts through cases sitting on the cargo bay benches.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Ah&#8230;perfect.</blockquote>
<p>[She tucks a pistol into the small of her back and heads to the pilot seat. She sits and starts trying to press the DHD symbols or start the jumper, but the ship stays powered down.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Come on, come on, come on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[She spins to find McKay has walked up behind her.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I&#8230;couldn't sleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, so you&#8230;came up to the jumper bay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(casually)<br />
Yeah&#8230;I thought I'd go for a ride&#8230;heh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In a puddle jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Is there a problem with that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A few. For starters, you don't have the Ancient gene, so you can't fly one, but you already know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Can you fly it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course I can. That's not the point. Look, you should be back in the infirmary.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva quickly stands and gets close to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
But you could take me for a ride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
What, now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(coy)<br />
Yeah, it'll really help me relax.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I thought Beckett gave you pills for that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(with frustrated sigh)<br />
They didn't work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sympathetic)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva stands nose to nose with McKay, running her hands up and down him.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(sultry)<br />
Yeah. Come on. Please? Just you and me&#8230;alone. Oh, you could take me somewhere secluded. We can&#8230;we could make love underneath the stars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Would you like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;yeah! I mean, I'd have to get a blanket though, because the mainland's groundcover is loaded with allergens.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No. Let's just go now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stepping away from her)<br />
Wait. W-w-w-wait. No, no, no, no, no. Look, you look. You should go back to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<p>[She steps into his space and begins touching him again.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(insistently)<br />
Forget about the infirmary. I need to be with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(self-conscious)<br />
Jennifer, please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Come on. I mean, just a quick ride. Don't you want to be with me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, yeah, I don't&#8230;no&#8230;yes! Just&#8230;I&#8230;will you stop! Look, I don't know what is wrong with you, but you are clearly not yourself. I'm taking you back to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches for her arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you can argue all you want, I'm not letting you&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay reaches for her, but she slaps his hand away and pushes him.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(through gritted teeth, angry)<br />
You're not taking me anywhere!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(firmly)<br />
Jennifer&#8230;now I need you to listen to me. As soon as you are cured of whatever it is that is affecting you, you're going to thank me for this. So, let's go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No! Don't you&#8212;!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grabs her arm but she twists out of his grasp and pulls out her gun, pointing it at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(horrified)<br />
What're you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(coldly)<br />
You should've taken me on that ride.</blockquote>
<p>[She primes the pistol, but before she can fire Ronon arrives and shoots her with a stun blast. Ronon and McKay exchange disturbed looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey, Sheppard's team, and Beckett all stare down at Neeva, who is strapped to the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I don't care what the scans say. Either she suffered a serious, mind-altering brain trauma, or some kind of entity has taken control of her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Has she been injured recently?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not that I know of. I mean, she was perfectly fine up until yesterday.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm telling you, her brain scan would've revealed any kind of physical trauma as well as any foreign organism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Unless the organism's good at hiding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Wouldn't be the first time. It took days to figure out Rodney was infected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I still don't think that we should rule out the possibility of a psychological event. We sometimes forget that working in this environment in a whole other galaxy can be emotionally overwhelming. Such acute stress has often been linked to various dissociative disorders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Disorders? She tried to kill me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Ach, Rodney. I don't think she would've pulled the trigger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(insistent)<br />
Hey, I saw the look in her eye. She&#8230;wait a second. What if she had something to do with Zelenka? What if she's the one who stabbed him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(dubious)<br />
Doctor Keller?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />

I'm&#8230;Neeva Casol. All right, let me explain. Back at the artifact vault, I accidentally activated some kind of Ancestral communications device that caused my mind to transfer into this woman's body and hers into mine.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller expression changes from bemusement to understanding.]
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
You expect us to believe that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Yeah, Jannick I do. I expect you to believe that, just as you did on Vara Sol when I brokered that deal with the fish merchant to save your life? And you, Bordal. If you didn't trust me back when you got caught at that brothel, those women would've made sure the thought of procreating never again entered your mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BORDAL<br />
How do you know about that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Because I'm Neeva! There's a link between this woman and me. Her mind is in my body, and mine is in hers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Look, whatever's happening here, I had nothing to do with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
No, she didn't, but if we're going to fix this, we need to move fast. We need to go back to the village, break into the vault, and turn off that device. We need to be really careful, because not only are the villagers out looking for us, but so are the people from Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
W-w-wait a second, they're here?! Who? Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Among others. But they're going to turn us into the villagers if they catch us, so we need no problems from you. Do you understand me?</blockquote>
<p>[She glares at Keller threateningly. Keller nervously nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
All right, we need to find this device&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Jannick brandishes his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
Stop! I don't know what's going on here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I just told you, all right. I am Neeva.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
I've never seen you before!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(frustrated)<br />
Jannick, listen to me. This is not the time to be stupid!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh, I wouldn't make him angry&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
You're going to put down the gun, and you're going to listen to what I say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
No. I'm not. I'm going to take the both of you with me. We're going to attack the ring <i>now</i>. And we'll sort out who's really who on another planet. And if you're lying to me, you're as good as dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva glares as Keller nervously looks from one to the other.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FORREST</b>
</p><p>[The four walk toward the gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
This Doctor McKay&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What about him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
You can do better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
Be quiet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Jannick, I know this is difficult to understand, and I was equally confused by it at the beginning, but you have to&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Gunfire just misses them and they dive for cover near a tree and stump. Jannick and Bordal blindly return fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
How many?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BORDAL<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
I count four!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
We'd be a lot better off if you could give us weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[Bordal rises to shoot, but is downed by a gun blast. Both Neeva and Keller reach for him. Keller sees the wound and checks his pulse.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He's dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva looks stricken by the news. Jannick fires back.]
</p><p>[In the distance, the Atlantis team hears the firefight and runs towards it.]
</p><p>[While Jannick is distracted, Keller runs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
Hey! Come back here! Stop!</blockquote>
<p>[Jannick aims at Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Jannick, no! Don't!</blockquote>
<p>[Neeva jumps up to pull down his arm. She's shot in the gut by one of the soldiers. Jannick too is wounded, but runs away. One soldier runs after Jannick, the other reloads as Neeva writhes in pain. He aims his shotgun, and Neeva wriggles to get away. The soldier is stunned by Ronon's pistol and the team arrives as Neeva collapses.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is she going to be all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, for now, but I need to stop the bleeding. Here, hold her steady, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grasps Neeva by the shoulders as Neeva winces in pain and Beckett begins to treat the wound.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE STORE</b>
</p><p>[The magistrate has joined the woman store owner and they look over some papers. The Atlantis team bursts in, McKay carrying Neeva. Teyla and Beckett shove some items off a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to villagers)<br />
You two, give us a hand here, please.<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
On the table, Ronon.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon lays Neeva on the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
(to magistrate)<br />
These are the people from Atlantis I was telling you about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angrily)<br />
She was shot by one of your men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
I warned you it was dangerous to venture out there.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard glares.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
What, is she dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, but she's badly wounded. Teyla, I'm going to need a hand, here. We need to remove the bullet and stop the bleeding.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And we need access to that communication terminal. We need to shut it down right now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
Why, what's it doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, simply put, it makes a psychic link between two people. So Doctor Keller and this&#8230;."Neeva Casol" have switched places. They're in each other's bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know about Atlantis, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(threateningly)<br />
Then you know you're better off being our friend than our enemy. So why don't you be our "friend", and show us where that terminal is?</blockquote>
<p>[The magistrate looks troubled, but makes a decision.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
This way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon, McKay, and Sheppard follow.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller continues to run through the woods.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE VAULT</b>
</p><p>[The magistrate unlocks the door and leads them in.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worriedly)<br />
It's still on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, obviously. So turn it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there's no switches. But it looks almost identical to the one SG-1 found.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE STORE</b>
</p><p>[Beckett works with surgical equipment to pull out the bullet from Neeva's side.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There's the bullet. Now to stem the bleeding.</blockquote>
<p>[He drops the bullet into a tray Teyla is holding. Teyla looks on worriedly as she holds up an IV bag in her other hand.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller comes to a sudden stop as she sees Jannick appear before her.]
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
I don't know who you are, but you are definitely not Neeva.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No, I'm not. But I'm not your enemy either, and if you'd just let me&#8230;I think I can help&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Jannick raises his gun to Keller's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
You're not helping anyone.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE VAULT</b>
</p><p>[McKay frantically types at some controls on his scanner, which is hooked up to the device.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, hurry up!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Believe me, I'm trying. Look, there's no way to access the control crystal. There doesn't seem to be a way to shut this thing off!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. What if&#8230;what if we blow it up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I don't know. I mean, maybe? I just&#8230;I'm just not sure if the explosion will cause a-a sudden power surge&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell'd the other guys do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, SG-1 dialed the 'gate and tossed the device into the vortex of a forming wormhole. It disintegrated instantly. But, you know, it's too far to carry it back to the 'gate!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
(furious)<br />
You got Bordal killed, and you've almost got me killed. I'm going to return the favor.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE VAULT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, well, we may not have much of a choice, so&#8230;give me a hand with this.</blockquote>
<p>[He moves to pick up the device. McKay goes to help even as he protests.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not sure we've got the time&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hold up&#8230;Move!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon unholsters his gun while speaking. Sheppard and McKay back up, and Ronon fires. The energy blast causes sparks and the control crystal's light darkens.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE STORE</b>
</p><p>[Keller awakens in her own body, lying on the table where Beckett just removed the bullet. She looks around in confusion, but her face brightens in relief as she sees the IV and Teyla standing by her side.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor Keller?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're back!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(relieved)<br />
I'm back.<br />
(pained)<br />
Ow&#8230;ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Shh. You've been shot, love. Don't worry. We removed the bullet. You'll be just fine.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Neeva opens her eyes to find herself staring down the barrel of Jannick's gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
Wait, Jannick. It's me, Neeva. They must've turned off the device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JANNICK<br />
Nice try.</blockquote>
<p>[He cocks his revolver.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEEVA<br />
(desperately)<br />
Jannick, no!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The echo of a shot is heard from the end of the previous scene.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey speaks to an expedition member.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I appreciate that, Dana. Say hello for me.</blockquote>
<p>[Dana nods and walks off. McKay comes through a transporter, carrying a loose bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates. Woolsey joins him as they walk down the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, well, well. What's the occasion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, just&#8230;visiting a friend in the infirmary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That's very thoughtful of you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Major Lorne and his team just returned. They did a full sweep of the planet. No sign of Neeva Casol. She must've managed to escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know about that. According to Jennifer, her accomplice was just about to kill her when we shut down the communication terminal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, either he did kill her and disposed of the body before escaping himself, or she got away from him somehow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I guess we'll never know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, we may. Word has gone out to several planets in the coalition. If Neeva is alive and roaming free, she won't be for long.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways. McKay looks troubled.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett stands by Keller's bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You'll promise you'll take it easy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(patronizing)<br />
Yes, Doctor.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay arrives, flowers and candy in hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(brightly)<br />
Don't worry. I will make sure of it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(pleased)<br />
Hey, you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Hey, you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, thank you, Rodney. Flowers and chocolates. I'm impressed.</blockquote>
<p>[He teasingly holds out his hands for the gifts.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unamused)<br />
Right. No. She's all alone in the infirmary. I just thought I would, you know, brighten the room up a bit?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka clears his throat pointedly from where he lies in the bed next to Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, hey Radek. How're you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(drily)<br />
Better, thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sympathetic)<br />
Again, Radek, I am so sorry for what happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's not you it's your fault. I told you, don't worry. I'm fine.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine. He's all perky and rosy cheeked and ready to go back to work.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett shoots him a glare.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(with annoyed sigh)<br />
I don't know about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He needs to get rest too, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(admonishing)<br />
I agree. His wound was much more serious than mine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Really? You were shot. He was just stabbed.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett heaves an exasperated sigh.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to Zelenka)<br />
Perhaps I should wheel you into another room?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Just until he's gone, please, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. Right.<br />
(to McKay, in farewell)<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett unlocks the wheels on Zelenka's bed and starts to wheel him out.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
<i>Cursing in Czech.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, yes. I completely agree.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
<i>Continues grumbling in Czech.</i></blockquote>
<p>[Keller smiles as she watches them leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Keller)<br />
Chocolates?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits in the chair next to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, I was thinking that, uh, when you were feeling better, we could maybe, um&#8230;you know, go for a ride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
A ride?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, you know, take the puddle jumper, go to the mainland, maybe have a picnic, maybe&#8230;lay out under the stars?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller blinks at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You did&#8230;turn off that communication terminal, right? There's no one else in there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, it's really me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(dubious)<br />
'Cause a puddle jumper ride? And the picnic under the stars? I mean, that's just so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So not me. Right. Okay. No. Bad idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No&#8230;<br />
(she takes his hand)<br />
I think it's a great idea.</blockquote>
<p>[They smile at each other.]
