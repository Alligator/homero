<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>VIDEO&#8212;DAY FIFTEEN</b>
</p><p>[McKay, dressed in a t-shirt and bathrobe, sits on a bench. He looks confused and his voice is slurred. He shifts around with awkward, uncoordinated movements.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
You can go ahead, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't remember where to start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Sure you do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Start with your name, like we've been doing, okay? We'll just go from there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My name&#8230;my name is&#8230;Mister Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
No&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(insistent)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Come on now. You're <i>Doctor</i> McKay, remember?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shakes his head in an exaggerated manner, as if his head is too heavy for him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I'm-I'm not anymore. I'm not&#8230;s-s-mart anymore. Doctors are smart, so I'm "mister" now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen, placating)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I used to be the s-smartest person ever. And-and now&#8230;and now, I'm-I'm not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
That's what we're trying to fix, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, you can't fix me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
You know we're trying our very best&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(becoming upset)<br />
No. You can't. You can't. Can't. Can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
It's okay, Rodney. What's the next thing you're supposed to say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where is&#8230;where did John go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
He just had to go away for a few minutes. He'll be back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
John?</blockquote>
<p>[He starts looking around for Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Rodney. Rodney, I'm your friend. I'm right here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(louder)<br />
Where are you, John? John!</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to get up as the video cuts off.]
</p><p><b>END VIDEOTAPE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[The image of McKay on the video is still paused. Jeannie Miller turns from watching the video to stare in shock at Woolsey and Sheppard. Keller stands nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(upset)<br />
Why the hell didn't you tell my brother was this far gone?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quietly)<br />
It happened pretty fast, Jeannie.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
No, I&#8230;I got a message from him just&#8212;just a couple of weeks ago. He seemed perfectly fine. He'd never been so nice!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nodding slowly)<br />
That&#8230;would've been shortly after he became infected. I didn't recognize the symptoms in time.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller fights to keep her composure.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not your fault, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Frankly, Mrs. Miller, we contacted you as soon as we became aware of the seriousness of his condition. In fact, <i>Daedalus</i> dropped you off at the first available 'gate in Pegasus because we were concerned that you&#8230;wouldn't make it here in time. We thought you deserved a chance&#8230;to say goodbye.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie stares at them in horror.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Jeannie, and Woolsey stare down through the window to where McKay is seated in a wheelchair below. He is in pajamas and bathrobe, staring into space. Keller kneels beside his chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Doctor Keller wanted to take a moment to&#8230;prepare him for your visit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(shakily)<br />
Yeah, I, uh&#8230;I think I need a moment myself. How did-how did this happen to him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quietly)<br />
Um&#8230;there was a little SNAFU on the last mission.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey steps to the control room balcony above the gate room. Sheppard's team is in off-world gear, waiting for the Stargate to finish dialing.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Colonel Sheppard, when you've reached the research camp, please remind Doctor Nichols that his is now&#8230;one hour and fifteen minutes overdue for his scheduled check-in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(deadpan)<br />
Right. Want me to&#8230;smack him around or anything?</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate kawhooshes.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(humorless)<br />
Just the reminder, please.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks away from the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Shouldn't we be concerned for Doctor Nichols's team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. No, the settlement's half-hour away from the 'gate. He's got them checking in every six. I'm sure Nichols is just tired of taking the round trip.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's team starts walking to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Still, it wouldn't hurt to bust his chops a bit. That Nichols is so arrogant.</blockquote>
<p>[The rest of the team shoot McKay knowing looks as they enter the wormhole.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey checks his watch and leans on Banks's station.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Hmm. Amelia, I think I'm going to risk heading down to breakfast before they check in. I just mean that&#8230;it will probably take them some time to get to the camp&#8230;and then more time for Nichols to get back to the 'gate and report. There's really no point in my&#8230;telling you this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(shakes her head)<br />
Not really, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts striding quickly out of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Right. Be back in twenty minutes!</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate starts to activate. A klaxon blares.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
Unscheduled off-world activation!</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey jogs back to her station.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Activate the shield!</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate kawhooshes as the shield encapsulates the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
I'm not receiving an IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio, breathless)<br />
This is Sheppard! Do not lower the shield! The entire tower will be flooded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I have no intention of doing that, Colonel. What's your status?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
It's cold and wet. The Stargate's underwater. The entire valley's flooded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
And it's freezing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We need you to send a jumper through so we can stay warm and dry until the water recedes.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey nods at Banks. She starts typing.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Will do, Colonel. Hold on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Holding on. Sheppard, out.</blockquote>
<p>[A jumper is lowered into the Gate Room, hovering while waiting for the Stargate to shut down so they can redial.]
</p>
<blockquote>JUMPER PILOT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rescue One is standing by.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
What's taking so long? Why isn't the 'gate disengaging?</blockquote>
<p>[Banks shakes her head and shrugs, looking baffled.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FLOODED VALLEY, M44-5Y9, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team are crouched together on top of the Stargate. Only the uppermost rim and chevron sits above water level. The Stargate is still active. They are all wet. McKay is shivering.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the water. The constant pressure's forcing the wormhole to stay active, which means we're going to have to wait the maximum amount of time a Stargate can stay open&#8212;thirty-eight minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we're down to thirty-two. And before you say "I told you so", we had no choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't stop shivering.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're letting all the hot air out of your mouth.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to laugh but it comes out more like a breathless sob.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, everybody. You'll be warm soon enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. I think I got wetter than you did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
I-I don't know. I got a little damp dialing the DHD.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The research camp was further up this valley. I'm a little concerned for Doctor Nichols's team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right.<br />
(keying radio)<br />
Anyone at the research camp, this is Colonel Sheppard. Please respond.</blockquote>
<p>[There is only static.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I repeat, this is Colonel Sheppard. Please respond.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm pretty sure they're all dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(protesting)<br />
We can't know that, Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, the research team was studying the effects of global warming. They set up camp at the foot of a massive glacier up the valley.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think an ice dam broke?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It fits. The Ancients don't put Stargates on a flood plain, and I certainly don't think the tide just came in. It explains why the water's so&#8230;freezing.<br />
(sneezing)<br />
Oh. Aw. Okay. Okay, so now I'm hot <i>and</i> I'm still shivering.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla feels his forehead.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Were you running a fever before we left?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. Maybe. I'm always running something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. I think the water's receded a little. So, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So we're going to be stuck here all night!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In the back of a warm, cozy jumper, all right? All you need to do is hold on for, I don't know, thirty minutes or so.</blockquote>
<p>[They are alone in a large valley. All around them is water and fog, up to the distant mountain ranges and massive glacier.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon carries an unconscious McKay through the wormhole. McKay is covered in a blanket. Sheppard and Teyla are with them. Keller and a medical team await with a gurney, and Ronon sets Rodney on it.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How long has he been unresponsive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Since he fell asleep in the jumper. About nine hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay, let's get him to the infirmary. I want him under a scanner. I want to have a look at you guys, too.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange surprised looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sternly)<br />
By that, I mean now.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves with McKay and the medical team. Woolsey walks with Sheppard out of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I think you've just made a case for my proposal to send a MALP ahead of every single transit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stuff happens, Woolsey. And by "stuff," I mean&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I know what you mean, thank you. Why didn't you return in the jumper I sent you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I ordered the rescue party to continue the search for Nichols's team. There's a chance they're still alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(abashed)<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I got to go get checked out, and then, uh, I'm going to go check on Rodney.</blockquote>
<p>[He jogs away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Keller stand by McKay's bed. He is conscious and alert. Sheppard arrives. still adjusting his sleeve from a blood draw. Another medical staff person finishes taking Ronon's blood pressure nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, how's our boy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No fever. No hypothermia. Nothing on the scan at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(brightly)<br />
How about you guys?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(as he leaves)<br />
Like I said, we're good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But we're not the ones who became unconscious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />									
Yeah, well, I&#8212;I didn't get much sleep the night before. And I did skimp on breakfast, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, Woolsey wants to send out a MALP before every transit now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that's going to get old fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what I said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um, hey, can I go now? I feel a little silly lying here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm keeping you under observation for a little longer. Besides, I ordered you dinner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, then you can observe me eat 'cause I'm famished.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Sheppard smile. Sheppard taps McKay's leg as they wave and start to head out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's official. He's better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See you guys!</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Do you want me to send them in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dully)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They watch as Keller moves to a telephone.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Rodney's all ready for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Well&#8230;what am I supposed to say?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives a weak attempt at a reassuring smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't matter.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ISOLATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Jeannie enters the room. McKay is sitting, staring to the side and forming sound shapes with his mouth. Jeannie stands there a moment, then moves quickly over and grabs a chair to sit in front of him.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(brightly)<br />
Meredith? It's me. It's Jeannie. Here. I'm here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voice slurred and slow)<br />
You're my sister.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(stunned)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Meredith's my&#8230;real name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
It's your first name, that's right. But you never liked it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No. It's&#8230;a girl's name.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie tries to laugh, but it comes out more as tears.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Sometimes, yes. But you go by Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Rodney McKay. Mister Rodney McKay. Rodney McKay. Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks away. Jeannie grasps McKay's hand and fights her tears. McKay doesn't quite look Jeannie in the eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're crying because of me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
No, I'm-I'm crying because I missed you very much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
'Cause you're my sister.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(voice breaking)<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(becoming upset)<br />
I'm&#8230;sick.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie grasps both his arms.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
I know. I know. I'm here now. I&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks confused. Jeannie fights to keep her composure.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Sweetie, I just need to go outside for one second, okay? I will be right back. I promise.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie hurries out of the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Once out of the room, Jeannie is unable to stop her sobs any longer. Ronon blocks her path. She tries to go around him, but he stays in front of her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie weeps. Ronon puts his arms around her comfortingly.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(sobbing)<br />
I just need a second. I just&#8230;don't want him&#8230;to see&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She steps back. Her breath hiccups as she tries to speak.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I know how you feel. I felt the same way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
I'll go back in&#8230;I will. He needs me, and I want to be able to say goodbye, but it's like&#8230;it's like he's already gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie nods, still weeping.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
There's a way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(surprised)<br />
What? How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's a place. I've been there before. He'll be himself again, and you can say goodbye.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie wipes away her tears, appearing confused.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
I don't understand. Then why haven't you already taken him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Because it's dangerous. But I'm willing to risk it if you are.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie considers this.]
</p><p><b>VIDEO&#8212;DAY SIX</b>
</p><p>[McKay sits in front of the camera, looking amused and dressed in his uniform.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
All set?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Remind me to register a complaint with whoever's idea this was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Uh, it was yours, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with great humor)<br />
Oh, ho ho. Well&#8230;complaint duly registered.</blockquote>
<p>[His voice has a barely noticeable slur.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
It was a good idea to get a keep a record of what's happening to you and&#8212;and how fast, but if you'd rather not&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, it's fine. It's fine. Start with my name, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I remembered something. Yay!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My name is Doctor Rodney McKay. I'm the head of the&#8230;department of science something in Atlantis in the, um&#8230;<br />
(sighs, fidgeting, upset)<br />
Oh, for god's sake&#8230;in the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Okay. Not bad. Keep going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking towards Keller)<br />
Jennifer, there's s-something I wanted to, um&#8230;you know, while I remember. While I still can. Something I wanted to say&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>END VIDEOTAPE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Jeannie knocks at the door. Keller quickly pauses the video of McKay she's been watching.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Jeannie, uh&#8230;I wasn't expecting anyone this late.</blockquote>
<p>[She shuts off the monitor screen of McKay's video.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Yeah, I'm kinda one of those people who needs all the information they can get.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller motions Jeannie over to a different computer monitor that shows a three-dimensional image of a brain.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This is his most recent scan. This dark area that looks like a tumor is actually a parasitic organism. Its tendrils spread far beyond any hope of surgical extraction, and it's not responding to treatment. Even stasis barely slowed its progression. There are still a number of drug combinations that&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(confused)<br />
He was infected somehow on his last mission?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, maybe, but&#8230;not necessarily. It was too small to show up on a scan at the time. But in the Pegasus Galaxy, the condition is fairly common among the very old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Right. So, why him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's possible we're all exposed to it and fight it off. Rodney was already suffering from a viral infection when he went on the mission to M44-5Y9, and then all that time in the freezing water&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
So his resistance was low.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
The parasite doesn't so much as kill cells as render them dormant, for reasons I still don't completely understand, but&#8230;the net result is ever-diminishing brain function. As it spreads, he'll lose motor control, regulation of organ function&#8212;</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(acerbic)<br />
Well, you can start with what is this place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's the Shrine of Talus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That means nothing to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's a planet of the Ancestors. We brought you here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you, Mr. Information. Since when did he become Ronon the Explainer? And why am I not in the infirmary, huh? What am I, better?<br />
(eyes widening)<br />
I am better!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sadly)<br />
No, you're not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I am. I can feel it. This is amazing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Mer, we brought you here so we could have a chance to say goodbye to each other. Well, you're only going to feel like this for about a day. That's just how it works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What&#8230;do you remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I remember you not wanting me to say goodbye then! Why now all of a sudden? Look, and why one day? What's with that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is the gift of the Shrine, and from all of us who risked great danger to bring you here. One last chance to be with those you love.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And then what?</blockquote>
<p>[No one speaks; they just look sympathetic.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
I die?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
With honor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And dignity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, screw that. I'll just stay here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It doesn't work that way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One, this is a Wraith-controlled planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
And we're detecting ionizing radiation. In fact, we shouldn't be standing this close to the Shrine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You've got to be kidding me!<br />
(to Keller, accusing)<br />
How could you let them do this to me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Don't blame her, she didn't even want to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, then whose brilliant idea was it?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie juts out her jaw and crosses her arms, looking away.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Mine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(cutting in)<br />
We all thought it was a good thing&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How could this possibly be a good thing? Look, I'd got past the humiliation. I'd said my goodbyes!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Meredith, I'm sorry this happened to you, but I'm not sorry that I got this chance. Please, just&#8230;try to see this as an opportunity and not&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(angrily)<br />
Not torture?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie looks away and huffs. The team look stricken.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(contrite)<br />
Look, I'm sorry. I just&#8230;I thought I was going to be okay, and then now you tell me&#8230;Did you have some kind of itinerary planned?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, actually, we're going to have a big feast first.</blockquote>
<p>[He heads over towards the packs by the waterfall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Last supper, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(lightly)<br />
Well, suits your Messiah complex.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
True.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie brushes his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Please&#8230;don't be mad at me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I guess if I had to choose the people I would spend my last day with, then&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(smiling)<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller goes back to scanning the Shrine pillar. It gives off a beep. McKay and Jeannie watch her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Honestly, I didn't expect it to work. I expected nothing would happen, and that would be that. So&#8230;why did it? You don't believe in magic shrines any more than I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Show him the readings.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller hands McKay her scanner. He takes his own scan.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
That's what I said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustically)<br />
You said "hmm"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
I just meant that I&#8230;thought it was weird too. So what do you think? Antimatter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or a superheavy element the Ancients used to use as an energy source. I've never seen it before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Or created to power whatever this place used to be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, who could tell what that is? It must be thousands of years since&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The scanner beeps rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa! See that spike?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(calling over)<br />
Come on. This is your party. Let's have some fun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, for me, this is fun! Just&#8230;save me some ham. Whoa, there it goes again. It's like some kind intermittent gamma that's&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Keller covers the scanner and his hands with her own and starts leading him to the cave entrance.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Come with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Because I need to find out something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Hopefully, all the way back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p>[As the reach the entrance, McKay doubles over in pain, screaming and clutching his head. Sheppard runs over and helps Keller lead him back into the cave.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(abashed)<br />
Sorry&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie comforts her brother and turns accusingly to Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Why did you do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
To determine whether the parasite would expand rapidly back into his brain when we took him from the radiation source. And I think it did. The reason why his symptoms disappeared when we came here was because it contracted to protect itself.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay continues to rock back and forth, doubled over and whimpering in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, well, what does that mean for us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
That leaving this chamber will rapidly kill him. We can't take him back to Atlantis. So&#8230;we're going to have to find a way for me to operate on him right here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;TALUS WATERFALL, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHRINE OF TALUS</b>
</p><p>[Keller, Sheppard, and Jeannie walk to another section of the cave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you already tried radiation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I did, but we'd never come across this kind before. The-the parasite is radiosensitive to it. That's why the Shrine works. You feel fine for one day until the radiation starts making you feel sick. And then you leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
The farther away you get, the more rapidly the parasite expands back into your brain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And your day is over. I get it. So, if we're here, it's small enough to operate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I'm guessing here, but that's the only thing I can think of that would explain his sudden remission. But&#8230;I-I'm not going to know for certain until I get in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How are you going to manage that with a field kit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't. We would have to bring equipment back from Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well that's a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What if we radio Atlantis and ask them to send a second jumper through with what I need?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
No. We can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I need that equipment, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, the Wraith are never going to fall for the same trick twice. Even if somehow they don't pick up on our radio signal, and even if the second jumper makes it through the gauntlet, they're going to know we're here. We're never going to make it back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie shakes her head, upset.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
If we don't try, he's dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard bites his lip and looks from Keller to Jeannie.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you need?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
To operate? I-I already told you&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. Bare minimum, what do you need?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
More than I have in my medical kit. I mean, I'd need a scanner to find out the location of the parasite. I'd need the proper tools to&#8230;cut his skull open&#8230;and&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. I've got an idea.<br />
(to Jeannie)<br />
Keep-keep him as far away from this thing as he can stand. We'll be back in twenty minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leads Keller out of the cave. Jeannie rejoins Teyla, Ronon, and McKay, who is sitting on the ground, quiet and weak. They help him up.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;TALUS FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Keller run through the forest.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Keller run inside. Sheppard grabs a case from the jumper supplies and rummages through it, pulling out a cordless drill.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh, you can't expect me to operate with those.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I've seen surgical drills. They're not that much different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
F-fine. Assuming we can open him up, I still have no way of knowing where the parasite has contracted to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He moves to the cockpit and pulls a life-signs detector of a side console.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We can use this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
A life-signs detector?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, it's just not designed to do what I need it to do on the correct scale.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, we'll have Jeannie modify it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
No, you don't understand. The radiation is compromising his immune system as we speak. Which means if I don't kill him, the infection he's bound to get by being operated on in a damp cave almost certainly will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, if we don't do something&#8230;he's dead. You said it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHRINE OF TALUS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Absolutely not!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
We're talking about saving your life.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay comes over to where Sheppard now sits and snatches up the drill.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, my brain is not some new deck off the back of your house!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not the one doing the surgery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(spinning to Keller)<br />
Yeah, and as my parting advice, you need to stop letting these guys talk you into doing stupid things!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(reassuring)<br />
I can do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
And I'm fairly sure I can modify the life-signs detector.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
Yeah, with my help&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
So help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, this isn't one of those&#8230;PBS brain surgeries where my&#8230;skull is wide open and we're having a conversation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I have enough anesthetic to put you out. You're not going to feel a thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, it's probably a hammer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Time is of the essence, Rodney. You need to make a decision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Please, Mer. Let us try.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, obviously I'd get around to consenting. It's just you&#8230;you've thrown an awful lot at me all at once.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's life.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs in resignation.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, well let me have a little ham. We'll uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. No food before surgery.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard claps McKay on the arm sympathetically.]
</p><p><b>VIDEO&#8212;DAY FIFTEEN</b>
</p><p>[McKay sits in the chair with a semi-vacant expression. He is in his bathrobe.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voice slurred)<br />
Bye, Jeannie. Sorry I was mean sometimes.</blockquote>
<p>[He waves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Bye. Bye, Teyla. Bye, Ronon Dex.</blockquote>
<p>[He smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Bye, John.</blockquote>
<p>[He stares at someone (likely Keller), offscreen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sadly)<br />
Bye.</blockquote>
<p><b>END VIDEOTAPE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHRINE OF TALUS</b>
</p><p>[McKay lies on the cave floor, unconscious and covered with a blanket, his head on a bed-roll. Keller, wearing surgical gloves, places an antiseptic pad on his forehead. Sheppard, also wearing gloves, assists, holding the pad in place and setting the life-signs detector on McKay's chest. Keller marks spots on McKay's head.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm going to have to cut here&#8230;here&#8230;and here, and drill those points to resect the area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't want to penetrate the dura layers until we get to that stage, so hold him as still as you can.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard holds McKay's head still and braces himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller cuts into McKay's head. She places clamps on either side of the cut and Sheppard holds the clamps in place with his fingers while holding McKay's head. Keller starts the drill and Sheppard looks to Ronon, who stands watch.]
</p><p>[Jeanne can no longer watch. She turns around, holding her head worriedly with one hand. She moves over to Teyla, while looking at her watch.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
I took too long reconfiguring the life-signs detector. I haven't given her enough time to perform the surgery before his immune system is compromised.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller abruptly stops drilling as McKay begins to seize.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Dammit, I went too far. Hold him steady.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(tightly)<br />
I'm trying.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller checks the life-signs detector.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's the parasite. It's moving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe it knows we're going after it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't think so. I-I think it instinctually wants to get away from the radiation source, and we've just shown it the way out.<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Ronon, we're going to need that big gun of yours in about ten seconds.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon unholsters his sidearm. The parasite crawls out of the opening. Keller snatches it with forceps and flings it away. Ronon shoots it. Teyla and Jeannie run over to check, but the parasite is merely a scorch mark in the sandy ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You could have stepped on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She told me to shoot it.</blockquote>
<p>[He lowers his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You did a good job.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller gives a shy smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You too.<br />
(to everyone)<br />
Let's get him home.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay sleeps in one of the beds, his head still bandaged. Jeannie sits at his side drinking coffee. Keller approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Why don't you get some sleep? I'm going to be here all night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
No, it's okay. I'd like to be here when he wakes up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(smiling)<br />
Well, it could be a while. He does love to sleep, our Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
(with wry laugh)<br />
You should've seen him when he was a teenager.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(groggily)<br />
Who can sleep with all the talking?</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie sets her coffee aside and leans over.]
</p>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
Hi!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gives a sleepy sigh and smiles at Jeannie.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JEANNIE<br />
You still, uh, all there?</blockquote>
<p>[She points to her head. McKay winces and shifts.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there was so much to spare.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie and Keller both smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Keller)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're welcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That was scary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
For me, too.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You hungry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(brightening slightly)<br />
Peckish.</blockquote>
<p>[Jeannie laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'll go order you something.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks away. Jeannie straightens McKay's covers absently.]
</p><p><b>VIDEO&#8212;DAY SIX</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking towards Keller)<br />
Jennifer, there's s-something I wanted to, um&#8230;while I remember. While I still can. Something I wanted to say before uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(offscreen)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I, uh&#8230;I love you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Keller smiles sadly at the video.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(on video)<br />
I've loved you for some time now. Okay, where was I?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller looks at the screen, with moist eyes and gives a sad smile before turning off the video.]
