<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Sheppard gather food from the line.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Are you sure you don't want to spend your leave going back to Earth with McKay and the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nah. The SGC doesn't have a ZPM, so two weeks on Earth means, uh, three weeks cooped up in the <i>Daedalus</i>. That's uh, five weeks of missing work. We only get one of those every year and a half, so I'd like to save mine for something more special.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(dubious)<br />
So we're going camping instead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On a beach that's never been surfed or even touched. You know, you gotta get a little more excited about this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(unenthusiastic)<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard spots McKay and Keller sitting at a table together.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, check that out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think he's ever going to make a move?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks up just as Keller laughs at something McKay said.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who cares?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(pensive)<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[He notices Ronon's gone and follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Say&#8230;I know we only get&#8230;fourteen days on Earth a year, and-and&#8230;you miss your dad and all&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
But&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See, one of my old&#8230;guy who was doing his doctorate the same time as me&#8230;he's giving a big secret presentation about some new thing that he's working on and everyone and anyone in the physics community is going to be there, and&#8230;well&#8230;See, the thing is, there's this perception out there that, uh, I'm um&#8230;like, a washout, recluse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, because I do this for a living. I mean, super double tip-top secret stuff. I mean, I haven't published a paper in a decade&amp;emdash;not one that can be read by the general public, and I'm kinda hard to get ahold of, what with living in another galaxy and all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, I know what that's like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly! They think I'm a shut-in. So&#8230;I was thinking&#8230;that, um, if I was to, say, show up with a woman&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A-a beautiful woman&#8230;that, um, they would maybe not think that I was&#8230;like, a complete loser. Like, it would be, like, one day. The first night we were there, and then you could be off to Chippewa Falls. I mean, it could be fun?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(coyly)<br />
Hmm. Well, let's see. Uh, a room <i>full</i> of physicists, um, a long-winded presentation I probably won't understand. Yeah, it doesn't really sound like fun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(hopefully)<br />
Well, there'll be drinks probably, and maybe those little sandwiches? And&#8230;me! I'll be there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(frustrated)<br />
You don't have to fabricate all these reasons on why you<i>need</i> me to be with you. You could just &#8230;ask me out on a date.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I didn't want to&#8230;I mean, I know you&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'll probably say yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you&#8230;you want to go to this thing with me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Sure. I'd love to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'd love&#8212; I mean, that's&#8230;Good! Good. Great. That's&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's a date.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing in relief)<br />
That's a date.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So, what's the presentation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. I&#8230;he doesn't want to tell anyone until we all get there. But, uh, if I know this guy, it'll be, you know, first-class presentation with like, second-rate science. Probably some minor adjustment to someone else's work, but, um, the food'll be good.</blockquote>
<p>[They get up and walk out of the mess hall together.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
And the company.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;KRAMER INNOVATIONS FACILITY, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KRAMER INNOVATIONS LAB</b>
</p><p>[Malcolm checks his data. Kramer enters, holding a paper report.]
</p>
<blockquote>KRAMER<br />
Malcolm, have you read this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KRAMER<br />
Your staff thinks it's reckless to turn this thing on tomorrow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
<i>Some</i> of my staff.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KRAMER<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Malcolm&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOM<br />
They're just getting cold feet, that's all. Do you remember all that stuff that came out before CERN turned on the LHC? You know, miniature black holes, exotic particles, strangelets, the instantaneous destruction of the planet? All unfounded histrionics. We are going to be just fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KRAMER<br />
So you're saying none of these potential catastrophes is going to happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOM<br />
Well, there is always the <i>slight</i> possibility that something <i>might</i> go wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KRAMER<br />
The Cause has a lot riding on this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Don't worry about it. Your precious "cause" will come out of this squeaky clean tomorrow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KRAMER<br />
Some of these worst-case scenarios are terrifying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(cutting him off)<br />
Of course they're terrifying! They're <i>worst-case</i> scenarios. They are the worst possible thing that could ever happen, ever!<br />
(sighing)<br />
Tomorrow's going to come off without a hitch. We've done hundreds of tests. There is <i>zero</i> possibility for failure.</blockquote>
<p>[Kramer doesn't look as sanguine.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(smiling confidently)<br />
Trust me.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;UNITED STATES AIRSPACE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A small private Learjet flies across the countryside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRIVATE JET</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Keller sit across from each other in the cabin of the plane. Keller is in a black cocktail dress, sipping champagne. McKay is in a tuxedo.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This is exciting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chuckling)<br />
Well, it's just a plane.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah, but I've never even flown first-class. I mean, this is&#8230;amazing. Have you tried these strawberries?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When I was ten, I ate a bowl full of strawberries and threw up. I haven't been able to stomach them since.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How does this guy afford all this? I thought he was just a physicist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, he was always able to dupe guys with deep pockets into backing his research, you know? It's amazing what a nice smile and a PowerPoint presentation will get you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, I am impressed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(primly)<br />
Yes. I can see that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, come on. You should be happy for your friend's success.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's more of an acquaintance than a friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Acquaintances don't pick you up in private planes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(scoffing)<br />
He didn't send the jet to be nice; he sent the jet to rub it in my face. Look, I was always one step ahead of this guy during school, and now that we're in the "real world", he wants to show me that, as far as most of the planet is concerned, he's a lot more successful than I am. And what is with the evening attire? We're going to a science talk, for god's sake. Who the hell does he think he is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I-is this is going to be what the whole day is going to be like? Are you going to be in a bad mood?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(chastised)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
'Cause we're back on Earth in a private jet, drinking expensive champagne, and your date's wearing a fancy dress. Most people would be having a good time, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're right. You're right. Hmm?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay picks up a strawberry and takes a bite. As he chews he spots a picture behind Keller of Malcolm with the Dalai Lama. He puts down the strawberry and grimaces in distaste.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;KRAMER INNOVATIONS FACILITY, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;KRAMER REGISTRATION AREA</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Keller step up to the registration desk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
McKay. Doctor Rodney McKay. Doctor Jennifer Keller.</blockquote>
<p>[Security checks their names off a list.]
</p>
<blockquote>SECURITY<br />
Yes, welcome. I'll just need you both to sign this non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.</blockquote>
<p>[He slaps two large reams of paper in front of them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, you're not serious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SECURITY<br />
Is there a problem, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This whole thing is a confidentiality agreement?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SECURITY<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what could he possibly be doing back there that needs to be kept two hundred pages secret?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SECURITY<br />
(firmly)<br />
If you want to go inside, sir, you need to sign the agreement.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller starts to sign hers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dinosaurs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SECURITY<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do they have living dinosaurs back there? Because I'll sign this if he's brought dinosaurs back to life. But short of that, he is out of his mind if he thinks I am going to pretend that whatever discovery he has made is so important and so secret that I have to sign the unabridged works of William Shakespeare here!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shakes her head and hands McKay her pen.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Just sign it. Here you go.</blockquote>
<p>[Abashed, McKay takes the pen and signs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Oh. You're just lucky the lady's here, aren't you?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;RECEPTION AREA</b>
</p><p>[Several people mill around, sipping cocktails and making small talk. Keller and McKay are near the center. McKay has a plate filled with small sandwiches.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Where do you think we are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. Arizona? Nevada? I didn't think people even built secret facilities anymore. It seems so&#8230;1950s.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
Rodney McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller and McKay turn to see Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson approaching them.]
</p>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
I had it on good authority that you were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unamused)<br />
Oh. Ha ha.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
And this would be your&#8230;sister?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, Neil, you know, she's not my sister. This is Jennifer Keller. That's Bill Nye and
(mumbling)<br />
Neil Degrasse Tyson.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shakes hands with them both. Keller stares at Tyson as if remembering something.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
You know, from television.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(blinking)<br />
Yeah. Uh&#8230;of course. Very nice to meet you.</blockquote>
<p>[She smiles and bites her lip.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
(charming)<br />
No, the pleasure's mine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And, she's taken, Neil.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
No, no, I didn't mean it <i>that</i> way. No!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Neil likes to steal things from me, things like women and theoretical physics ideas.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
(to Nye)<br />
Yeah, but who hasn't stolen an idea from the "great" Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(preening)<br />
Oh, so we admit it now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
(to Keller)<br />
See, back in the day, whenever any one of these people came up with a new idea or published an new paper, Dr. McKay here would swear that he was already working on something very similar&#8212;just hadn't gotten around to publishing it yet.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller shoots McKay a sympathetic smile while McKay steams.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
He'd say things like, "I was about to say that very same thing!" Or, "I was just about to have that&#8230;same idea."</blockquote>
<p>[Nye rolls his eyes sarcastically and twirls his finger in miming agreement to Tyson.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, at least I didn't declassify Pluto from planet status. Way to make all the little kids cry, Neil. That make you feel like a big man?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
See, thanks to Dr. Tyson, Pluto is now the first of the Plutoids&#8212;a new class of celestial object. It's cool! Come on, Rodney, it's the 21st century!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
Actually, come to think of it, when was the last time you even published a paper? It was like, the 80s?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(startled)<br />
It&#8230;hasn't been that long.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller frowns as she follows the conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
I think I was listening to that band, <i>A Flock of Seagulls</i>, while I was reading it.</blockquote>
<p>[He chuckles and looks at Keller, who smiles politely and ducks her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
Actually, it might have been pre-Reagan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(drily)<br />
Well, it has been great running into you guys. We should&#8230;maybe get our seats.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Bye.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks away. Keller follows. Nye watches them go with a slow whistle.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
They can't possibly be dating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
I know. Well, Neil, you're married, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Tyson flashes his wedding ring.]
</p>
<blockquote>NYE<br />
Dibs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYSON<br />
(chuckling)<br />
She's all yours.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CARL BINDER MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM</b>
</p><p>[People take their seats in the auditorium.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think maybe this was a bad idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I just&#8230;remembered I don't&#8230;really like these people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Is it that&#8230;you don't like them, or maybe, they don't like you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm, possibly. I mean I&#8230;I used to be a little&#8230;abrasive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, used to be, yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's hard to explain. I mean my&#8230;field is very competitive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(drily)<br />
Yeah, I went to med school for six years. I wouldn't know anything about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh&#8230;right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not everything has to be a competition, Rodney. They know how smart you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not sure they do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Of course they do. You don't have to keep reminding them. It's called being humble. Have you&#8230;heard that word before?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shoots her a look and scoffs.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Look, we're on our first date and I've come to a <i>physics talk</i>, okay? You have to bend a little bit too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Humble, eh? I guess I can try anything once.</blockquote>
<p>[She holds his hand. He smiles at her as the lights lower. New Age music plays as a revolving Earth appears on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(voiceover)<br />
Earth. Our home. Our planet. The very vessel of life. Our world&#8212;unique, irreplaceable. And yet, at times, it seems like we are unrelenting in our quest o drive our ecosystem into catastrophic failure.</blockquote>
<p>[Pictures of pollution evidence appear across the globe.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(continuing, voiceover)<br />
Gone unchecked, global warming <i>will</i> transform this lush world we know today into a lifeless and arid rock.</blockquote>
<p>[The Earth picture transforms into a dried up husk.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(continuing, voiceover)<br />
Friends, the stakes couldn't be higher. The situation, no more dire. It's time&#8230;to act!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Keller exchange looks as the Earth picture dissolves and Malcolm's last name "TUNNEY" appears. Malcolm steps in front of the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Hello. I'm Malcolm Tunney.</blockquote>
<p>[The audience applauds politely.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustically, to Keller)<br />
If he's so worried about global warming, why'd he fly us here in a private jet? That spews out more CO2 than Sweden.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller snickers but shushes him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Thank you very much. You're very kind. As many of you know, I am <i>not</i> an environmental scientist. Nor do I pretend to be one. For instance, I shower regularly.</blockquote>
<p>[Many in the audience laugh.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(looking at man in front row)<br />
No offense, Larry.</blockquote>
<p>[Larry, a large man with a long fuzzy white beard and wearing an unkempt suit, does not respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
I'm just a concerned citizen, one who realizes that the Earth has carried for us so long, maybe it's time that we&#8230;carried her.</blockquote>
<p>[As he speaks the Earth image appears again shrinking to look as if it fits on the palm of his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(low, to Keller)<br />
That ratio would be accurate if his body was the size of his ego.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(grimacing, speaking low)<br />
Yeah. It's a little much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<p>[A flatter map image of the planet appears on the screen and a common symbol/pictogram of men and women scatter across the continents.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Solving a problem like global warming may seem impossibly complex. So many nations, so many corporations, and John Q. Public will have to agree on a dizzying number of issues. So then&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks around to see the audience's reaction. The map image disappears and one male pictogram fills the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(continuing)<br />
&#8230;what can one person do to make a difference? What can I&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[The pictogram transforms into a picture of Malcolm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
&#8230;with my particular and unique skill set, do to help?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(sarcastic, to McKay)<br />
They think <i>you're</i> the arrogant one?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay harrumphs in agreement.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
I've been working on a number of projects over the last decade, and I realized that if I were to combine them, I just may be able to achieve something unexpected. So, ladies and gentlemen, with major funding from my friends at Kramer Innovations, I have been able to device a means to cool our planet in a safe and controlled way.</blockquote>
<p>[The screen image changes to Kramer Innovations' logo.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
This guy wouldn't know cool&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay ignores Keller, leaning forward, intrigued. Keller notices and pays more attention herself. The rest of audience is also murmuring in interest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Now, the science behind this is immensely complex. But&#8230;there will be detailed briefs handed out to you as you leave the lecture hall. But for right now, let me just give you the <i>Cliffs Notes</i>. It begins with a massive heat-sink, one of my own design, which steadily draws heat from the surrounding environment.</blockquote>
<p>[The screen shows a schematic of the heat sink.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER AND MCKAY<br />
(muttering to themselves)<br />
Where does the heat go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
(continuing his lecture)<br />
Where does that heat go, you may ask. Well, my friends, that is the hard part. I give you&#8230;the Tunney Space-Time Matter Bridge.</blockquote>
<p>[The screen shows a heat transfer bridge between two space-time locations.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait&#8230;what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
Now, this isn't just some theoretical math proof. This is a functioning piece of technology&#8212;one that literally moves heat from our space-time and vents it out into another space-time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shocked)<br />
That's my bridge&#8230;you know, my sister and I came up with that.</blockquote>
<p>[A man nearby turns and glares at McKay. Keller clutches McKay's arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Shh.<br />
(to annoyed neighbor)<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
And&#8230;it works. We've been testing the system for a few months now, and it has proved to be remarkably stable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(louder)<br />
That's my idea!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(whispering)<br />
Rodney, now is not the time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALCOLM<br />
For the purposes of the demonstration today, I have surrounded this facility with an electrified plasma grid that will contain the reach of the heat-sink. It will draw heat only from this facility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
Wait, he's going to turn it on with us here? I mean&#8230;that&#8230;this&#8230;this is a bad idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />

You saw a paper about a matter bridge&#8212;a project that was shut down due to the adverse effects of exotic particles. You read it. You realized that if the bridge was used merely as a transfer of energy, say, heat, there would be no exotic particle creation, and thus no adverse effects. So you co-opted the science as your own, made a few changes to make yourself feel better, and got to work, dismissing the original author's warnings about the inherent instability of time-space bridges.

Hey, my contract with SGC is up this year. Maybe it's time for me to move on, time for me to&#8230;do other things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Please. I don't anyone who loves their job more than you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(knowing bluff has been called)<br />
Hmph.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So you think the military's going to let them keep experimenting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think it's highly unlikely. Besides, geoengineering's a dumb pursuit anyway. I mean, no one person's going to solve global warming. We all have to do our part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(deadpan)<br />
Like not take private jets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they were going our way anyway.</blockquote>
<p>[They both smile and chuckle.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(coyly)<br />
You know, it's kind of nice just me and you back here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller raises her eyebrows with an expectant look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(realizing)<br />
Right! Wait, you were legally dead a few hours ago. You were practically frozen. You really want to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, it's either that or you keep telling me how you and only you saved the day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nah&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He changes seats to sit next to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm trying this whole, um, "humble" thing out. It seems to be quite a hit with  the ladies.</blockquote>
<p>[They begin to kiss, Keller untangling herself from her blanket to embrace McKay as the kiss deepens.]
