<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Two men move through some woods, one holding a lantern to find the way. The other, Mirellus, is holding a basket of something.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
I told you we should have started back sooner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Well if we left when you had said, we'd have been returning home empty handed.</blockquote>
<p>[The man gestures for them to stop.]
</p>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Why are we stopping?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
I saw someone&#8230; Hello?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
There's nobody there.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<p>[The see someone crouched in the fog, indistinct.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
Are you all right, friend? Are you lost?</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches for the man, whose head twitches. They both back away and turn to run. Mirellus gets away, but his friend does not follow, and is lost in the fog. Mirellus turns away and comes face-to-face with a man in a gas mask.]
</p><p><b>ONE YEAR LATER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LAB ON PLANET</b>
</p><p>[The all-woman team of Porter, Vega, Mehra, and Teldy explore a dark, wet corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
The signal's getting stronger.</blockquote>
<p>[Vega tosses a glow-stick on the ground to mark their path, then sees that it has landed beside a gas mask.]
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
Hey, what's this?</blockquote>
<p>[She picks it up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
It's really creepy is what it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
(from down the corridor)<br />
We found something.</blockquote>
<p>[Vega and Mehra join the others further down the tunnel. They see something.]
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
I think we'd better contact Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BECKETT'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Beckett is packing a bag of clothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't believe you're leaving. I mean, you know, you're sick, we cure you, you go away for six months to recover, you finally come back and now, what, you're here a week, you're leaving again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm sorry, Rodney, but for the time being I realize that my place isn't here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Of course it is. What are you, kidding me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
As a doctor, I can't just sit by and do nothing while people in this galaxy are suffering &#8212; especially when I know I've had a hand in what's happened to them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
C'mon, you cannot blame yourself, all right? Look, Michael forced you to help him. He was the one disseminating the drug.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, and I'm the one that helped the Hoffans perfect it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel. Just in time to give us a hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Actually, Doc, you're gonna have to delay your travel plans. Just got word from Major Teldy. They've found another one of Michael's labs.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Beckett walk through a heavily wooded forest with no clear paths.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I wish you'd told me we'd be doing so much walking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did I forget to mention that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, you did. You also forgot to mention the fact that we'd be rappelling down the side of a mountain! My legs are seizing up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's what happens when you do nothing for six months of R &amp; R.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Not to mention two months in a stasis pod, thank you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Two months?! Try eight hundred years! That'll give you rubber legs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Colonel!</blockquote>
<p>[Teldy and her team meet them coming the other way. Sheppard seems surprised by the team's make-up. He and Teldy salute each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(introducing Beckett)<br />
Major Teldy, Doctor Beckett. Doctor Beckett, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
This is Sergeant Mehra, Doctor Porter, and of course you've already met Captain Vega.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't realize you, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
That my team was a bunch of girls, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's not what <i>I</i> was gonna say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But, you know, now that you mention it &#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Well, I was told to pick the best and the brightest. Funny how that worked out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Funny.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Shall we?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods. He and Beckett are awkward.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[The team turns around back the way they had come. Beckett and Sheppard fist-bump each other.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CATACOMBS NEAR LAB</b>
</p><p>[They all enter the corridor leading to Michael's lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
We were passing through the area when we picked up a low level energy signature. We were able to triangulate and get a lock on the signal and then follow it down into these catacombs. It's a bit of a walk.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[They arrive sometime later. The room has Wraith-type computer terminals and stasis pods. Everything is in a state of disrepair.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
The signal finally led us to this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Stasis pods. I spent some time in a number of Michael's labs when I was his prisoner, but this is one I'm not familiar with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Well, looks like the cleaning crew hasn't been around in a while.</blockquote>
<p>[Mehra taps on the door of a chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, Sarge!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Sorry, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And can we hold off touching stuff here? Last thing I need is another three tons of rubble falling on my head, all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
It's all right. I've disabled the security protocols.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Oh, yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why the hell didn't McKay think of that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
There was no way for him to have known. But thanks to the information that he gathered from that experience, I'm able to bypass the security protocols this time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what've you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, data related to Michael's experiments in this lab. This could prove to be very valuable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Going through all of this information may take a while, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, aye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
Maybe we should go check out the village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What village?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
We spotted it this morning. It's just a few clicks south of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
The locals might have some information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess that beats sittin' around here watching these guys read.<br />
(to Mehra)<br />
Sergeant, you're with them. Make sure they don't geek out too much, all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega leave, leaving Mehra to watch Beckett and Porter. Beckett and Porter look at a computer terminal.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Nice work, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Very nice.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at Mehra, who turns away as if put off by the flirtation going on.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega head toward the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
You know what I'd love right about now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let me guess&#8230; a beer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
A puddle pumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that could've been arranged had I known we'd be walking for so long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Yeah, well, the area's too heavily forested. There's nowhere to land. Besides, this is good exercise. Firms up your glutes and calves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, great. Couple more hours of this and I can skip my cardio funk workout.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Mehra takes a bit from a power bar while Beckett and Porter work at the computer. Mehra idly taps on a chamber door, the silhouette of a human-shaped being visible behind it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
They alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
They're in stasis. Their physical and chemical processes have been suspended but, yes, they're alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
So, can you wake 'em up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, without the proper understanding of their respective conditions, I'm afraid that might kill them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Hmm. Just gonna keep them on ice until you figure something out, huh? Well, I guess it doesn't matter to them, or their families who've probably written them off. But, boy, that would make for one hell of a reunion, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett looks uncomfortable, and Porter clears her throat while staring pointedly at Mehra.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
I think I'm going to check the perimeter. Holler if you need me.</blockquote>
<p>[She walks out.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You have no need to apologize, and frankly, neither does she. She's right.<br />
Resurrections make for very interesting reunions, especially when the dead man had no idea he was dead to begin with. I'm sorry. How about you, Doctor Porter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Oh, Alison.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Alison. Any interesting experiences you'd like to share? Encountered any dangerous predators? Been cloned lately?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
No. But in all fairness, I am new to the Pegasus galaxy, and I hear that cloning is more of a second-year thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Third, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
(smiling)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[His laptop, connected to the Wraith terminal, beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hang on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It appears to be Michael's earliest version of a human-iratus hybrid.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The rustic village appears deserted and overgrown. Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega walk slowly through.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hello? Anyone here? All right. Let's split up, take a look around. Maintain radio contact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[The move off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Vega enters alone and shines her flashlight around the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teldy explores the area.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE STREET</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard comes out of a building.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Vega, you got anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Nothing on this end. Uh, it looks like the locals cleared out a while ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. The question is why?</blockquote>
<p>[Someone is watching Sheppard as he walks away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Beckett works on his laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Incredible. According to this, these earliest test subjects weren't technically human-iratus hybrids. They're a combination of several other life forms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Maybe that's why he discontinued this line of research. It proved overly ambitious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, no. According to this, the experiment was a success.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
So what does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, it means there's nothing we could do for them, because these things in here&#8230; aren't people any more.</blockquote>
<p>[While they look into a stasis pod, Mehra comes up behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<p>[The startle and turn around, sighing in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Just wanted to let you know it's gonna get dark soon, so are we gonna make this thing an all-nighter or&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, Sergeant.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Something watches Sheppard walk by a doorway. It follows Sheppard out onto the street, to find Sheppard sitting on some stairs and looking back, his P-90 ready.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<p>[The "something" is Mirellus. Teldy and Vega approach from behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
Easy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Who are you? Where do you come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we came through that big round thing. We're explorers. Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
My name is Mirellus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Well, Mirellus, why don't you tell us what happened here? Where is everyone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
It began about a year and a half ago. Locals started disappearing. From the surrounding forest at first and then from within the village itself. Day, night &#8212; they vanished without a trace. There was no reason for what was happening. No explanation except one: this village was cursed. And so we abandoned it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then why are you still here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
I now live in the next village. I spotted you exiting the caves, and I followed you to find out what you were doing here and, if necessary, to warn you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(standing and approaching)<br />
Well, what can you tell us about those caves?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
They are also rumored to be a dangerous place&#8230; although the fact that you survived the visit would suggest otherwise. What did you find there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, do you copy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Don't tell me you're already done, Beckett.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Oh no, far from it. We've downloaded some information into the tablets. We'd like to go over it this evening. Ideally, we'd like to stick around, possibly bed down in the village if there's room for us.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ah, well, I think there's a little room here, yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Great, we'll head your way then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Mirellus)<br />
Sorry about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
I wish you luck if you're planning to stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa, whoa. We're not finished with this conversation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Night is falling, and this isn't a safe place. I must go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, suit yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[Mirellus leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Night is falling. Beckett, Mehra, and Porter head toward the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
So, Sergeant, I hear you served with Stargate Command before transferring over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Yeah, but Pegasus had more of what I was looking for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And what was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Bad guys who need killin'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
The Milky Way just hasn't been the same since the Ori got their butts kicked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, some would argue that the situation's actually improved&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Mehra signals for them to stop.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Thought I heard something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[She scans the area.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
It's probably nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[The move out.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to Porter, on edge)<br />
Geez.</blockquote>
<p>[Something is watching them from the forrest and comes out of cover after they leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Everyone has gathered.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we're going over to the next village to talk to some locals. You guys need anything, want anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Yeah. If you happen to pass a Starbucks, I'll take a grande triple sugar free vanilla latte.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No problem! Sarge&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
I'm babysitting. Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Be back in a couple of hours.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Teldy, and Vega leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[Something moves through the corridors, stopping in front of a pod. Its door slides open, and green gas escapes, obscuring everything.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and Porter work on their tablet computers. Mehra sits against the wall, behind them, reading "The Martian Chronicles".]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
(fatigued)<br />
Oh! I feel like I'm back in college studying for my mid-terms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know what you mean. Where was that, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Cal Tech. Go Beavers!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye! What year did you graduate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
1996.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh! So you're just a youngster!</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Oh! Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Mehra laughs at the scene. They turn to look at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
I just read something funny.</blockquote>
<p>[The turn back from her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
And really obvious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Anyway, what brings you here to the Pegasus galaxy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Well, you can just chalk that up to my sense of adventure. A desire to visit strange, unexplored worlds; meet new and interesting people&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They laugh flirtatiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Okay, I'm gonna go check the perimeter. Be back in twenty&#8230; Unless there's a sock on the doorknob.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves. Beckett and Porter laugh uncomfortably.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She's a character, that one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and his team walk through woods. It is hard to see.]
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
This fog sure rolled in quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Vega, are you sure we're heading' in the right direction?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
More or less.</blockquote>
<p>[Teldy's flashlight goes out. She taps it.]
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Oh, dammit.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's goes out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great. Mine too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Something in the fog's messing with the lights. Makes you wonder what we're walking through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
Or breathing.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard makes the signal to stop.]
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
What's the matter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think I saw something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
okay, I definitely saw something that time.</blockquote>
<p>[A figure rushes by. The three stand with their backs to each other, weapons raised.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Mehra strolls casually, whistling to herself. The looks over at the village well. She picks up a rock, climbs the steps to the well, and drops it in. She listens for the rock to land. The flashlight on her P-90 fades out. She hits it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Damn.</blockquote>
<p>[She looks down to see an old doll lying in the leaves that looks like it was fashioned after a zombie. She picks it up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Creepy!</blockquote>
<p>[She tosses it back to the ground and continues her patrol. Behind her, fog begins to rise from the well.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
It's probably just some animal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Just some animal that seems to be stalking us. What a relief.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Quiet! I heard something.</blockquote>
<p>[Mirellus appears out of the fog, surprising them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, Mirellus!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Demons!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
They're out there in the mist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Demons, right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
They're after me! All of us are in danger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Take it easy.</blockquote>

With all due respect, we're not buying any of this, are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Stay sharp, Vega.</blockquote>
<p>[Vega takes a few steps away from them.]
</p>
<blockquote>VEGA<br />
Well, let's get back to Atlantis before&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Something grabs her from behind and pulls her straight back into the fog. The others rush toward her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Vega! Vega!</blockquote>
<p>[They find her lying on the forest floor. Sheppard checks her pulse.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Crap.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sees a figure moving in the fog. It approaches, then attacks. Sheppard shoots it, and it screams and falls. He and Teldy see more figures moving. He grab Vega's gun.]

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Fall back!</blockquote>
<p>[Teldy, Sheppard, and Mirellus head away.]

So am I, Alison.</blockquote>
<p>[The hear gunfire outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<p>[The rush outside. Beckett activates his radio. Mehra joins them.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel, is everything all right? Colonel, do you read? Colonel?<br />
(to others)<br />
I'm getting nothing on the radio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Get back inside. I'll check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm coming with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Like hell you are!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not gonna let you go out there by yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
(insistent)<br />
The colonel told me to take care of you. That is exactly what I'm doing. You two are staying here, as far away from that gunfire as possible. Now, you get back inside, and you lock that door.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You can't tell me to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
That is an order.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Carson, come on.</blockquote>
<p>[Carson concedes. Mehra leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[They go back inside the building.]

</p><p>[Sheppard, Mirellus, and Teldy make their way to the lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
I'm sorry. I didn't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<p>[The reach the lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Oh my god. The pods have been opened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
It was me. I released them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
When you asked about the caves, I knew you'd found something. I came to see for myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Because my wife was among the missing. When I saw the bodies sealed in those things, I thought that maybe&#8230; I didn't know. I thought that I could save her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Twelve pods. That means there's twelve of those things running around out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Minus the one you took out, that leaves us with eleven.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Beckett? Doctor Porter?</blockquote>
<p>[There is only static.]
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
That must be the mist. I mean, it's messing with our flashlights; probably radios too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's your Wraith language skills?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
I'm guessing about as good as yours are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we need Beckett and Doctor Porter here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Let's go get 'em.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
But the demons are still out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll be back for you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teldy head out. After a moment, Mirellus is too uncomfortable to stay behind.]
</p>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Porter looks out through through the slats boarding the windows.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
It's getting pretty foggy out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I shouldn't have let her go out there by herself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
You were under orders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I should have insisted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
And she probably would have decked you. You don't know Dusty.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear a faint sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Maybe she's back.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett opens the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Sergeant? Sergeant, is that you? Dammit.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett starts to put on his gear.]
</p>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm going out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Dusty told us to stay inside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look, it's probably nothing, but just in case it's someone, I'd like to surprise them instead of the other way around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look, Alison, I'll be fine. You just stay put, okay?</blockquote>
<p>[She nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes out into the fog. His flashlight fails.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Sergeant? Sergeant Mehra?</blockquote>
<p>[He sees a creature. It is making strange clicking sounds like they heard earlier.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Dear Lord!</blockquote>
<p>[He steps backward to escape, but snaps a twig. The creature hears and launches itself after him. Beckett runs, trips, then gets back up. He comes to rest against a rock. He looks all around, pointing his gun, panting in fear. He senses something and quiets. A creature is right there, trying to hear or smell him. Its eye sockets are scarred over. It expels some fog. Not hearing Beckett, it slithers away. Beckett's radio screams static in his ear. He grabs it. The creature descends on him again, this time to attack. Mehra shoots it from behind. Mehra grabs Beckett to get him up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Come on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Geez, Sergeant!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Move it, move it! Go!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Mehra and Beckett rush in.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Where's Alison?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
What were those things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Lower your voice. I think those creatures hunt by sound.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Teldy, and Mirellus burst in.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, God!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Judging from that, I guess you already know what's going on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Where's the Captain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Where's Porter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, that's great All we need now is for the Prom Queen and the kid in the wheelchair to wander off and we're all set.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We have to find her. She has no idea what's out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell <i>is</i> out there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Michael's experiments.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Yeah, I think we figured that one out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's an early version of the hybrid. It's been genetically altered to incorporate the predatory characteristics of several other creatures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
What other creatures?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not sure. All I know for certain is that they're blind and they hunt by sound. And that fog out there is not a natural weather phenomenon. I saw one of them exude the mist from the gills on its neck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
What, like a squid releasing its ink?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Except that's a defensive mechanism. These creatures clearly use the fog as a predatory device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Which I'm guessing explains the gas masks back at the lab.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
God knows what the prolonged exposure to this mist could do to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've got a great idea. Let's not find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
We should wait here until dawn; then it will be safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Those things out there are not nocturnal. Day or night, it doesn't matter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Besides, we can't sit around. We've gotta find Porter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
You can't be serious! You're going out there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Get back to work on that data. Try and figure out a way on how to deal with these things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That might be a problem, Colonel. There's a reason Michael abandoned that research. Even he couldn't control those creatures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE STREETS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[They walk through the fog using large chemical glow-sticks for light.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Sure you're gonna be okay here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
As long as we're quiet, we'll be safer in here than you are out there.</blockquote>
<p>[He stakes a glow-stick in the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. We're going to split up to cover more ground. Back in twenty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[The move off, each patrolling in their own. Sheppard hears the clicking and turns around, but not in time to see the creature. He continues on. Teldy holds her light-stick over the well. A creatures climbs the side of the well and attacks her. She fires her weapon. Nearby Mehra hears the gunfire and rushes to help. Elsewhere, Sheppard descends a staircase and hears stuttered breathing. He comes upon Porter, sitting in a corner in fear.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Shh. Whatever you do, be quiet.</blockquote>
<p>[He helps her up and the head off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
This was a mistake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Keep your voice down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
(loudly)<br />
I told him it was too dangerous!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Shh! Quiet!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Instead of coming back here, we should have gone to the next village. We'd be safe there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Shut it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIRELLUS<br />
Now we could all&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Creatures burst through the door and drag Mirellus out. Beckett raises his gun but has no clear target. He rushes to pull a sliding wooden door across the new hole in the wall. Fog starts seeping under the door, and creatures rattle the door.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Porter meet up with Mehra after they wave their glow-sticks at each other through the fog.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Ali, you okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's head out.</blockquote>
<p>[They move away together. The see another glow-stick moving nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Colonel. It's Major Teldy. She doesn't see us.</blockquote>
<p>[She moves toward the light only to find the light-stick is embedded in the shoulder of a creature. She shoots it. Sheppard approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Mehra)<br />
Take the six.</blockquote>
<p>[The approach and enter the building where they'd left Beckett, finding Teldy there.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Yeah, for a while there, so did I.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the others? Think they made it out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
(bending down to look)<br />
Well, I'm guessing at least one of them didn't. I've got blood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No way to know.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Carson makes his way through the fog.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
One of those things came crawling right up out of the well. It got me thinking.<br />
Those catacombs &#8212; they run for miles in every direction. So I'm guessing that one of them runs right to that well and into the center of town.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
That would explain how Michael could snag his test subjects without being seen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, well, we saw twelve of those pods in the lab. I killed one back in the forest, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
I tagged two &#8212; which, incidentally, puts me in the lead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
All right, well that brings us down to nine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, so now what? Any ideas?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Well, those creatures possess a heightened auditory system that allows them to hunt blind. We could try exploiting it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
I don't know. Maybe luring them into an ambush.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
What the hell do you plan on using as bait?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
(inspired, she holds up a laptop)<br />
This.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard uses his compass and some bullets to represent the plan on a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, here's how it's gonna work. While you three are taking up high ground positions, Teldy and Porter here, Mehra over here. I'm gonna be on the ground setting charges.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
You're gonna blow the well?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, that's the plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Okay, well you'd better use the timer. If the fog is messing with our radios and flashlights, chances are a remote detonator won't work either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Once I get to the well, I'll turn on the computer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTER<br />
Okay. Well, I programmed it to emit an ultrasonic burst, so that'll draw them right to you. But remember, if it gets near the fog&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll put it halfway down. That should keep it out of reach and working long enough to attract all nine. You three, just take up positions, sit tight until you hear a signal, then open up on anything that moves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
And what's the signal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That would be the well blowing sky high.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
And where will you be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, hopefully as far away as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
What if this goes sideways?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't be so negative, Teldy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
I'm serious, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You take up positions, you sit tight and wait for the signal. You don't move. You don't make a noise until the well blows.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Colonel, what if&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think I've made myself clear, Sarge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEHRA<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do we all know what we're doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TELDY<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>

Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[The all grab their gear.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE NEAR WELL, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teldy, Porter, and Mehra take up positions on balconies overlooking the well. Sheppard approaches the well and starts to wench up the bucket, cringing because of the nose the rusty mechanism makes. Once the bucket is raised, he gets his gear from his backpack. He activates the laptop and puts it in the bucket, then lowers the bucket as quietly as possible. He steps back and sets the timer on the C-4 block for five minutes. Before he can throw it in the well, a creature attacks him, knocking the C-4 from his hand. The fight each other.]

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank god. What, did you lose something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, my C-4.</blockquote>
<p>[Unseen, the C-4 timer has clicked down to one and a half minutes. More creatures move in.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
