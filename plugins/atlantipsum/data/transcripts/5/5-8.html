</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies through an incoming active Spacegate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team and Keller are inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I still say we should've brought backup. Another jumper or a marine unit, something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is intended to be a diplomatic mission, Rodney. What kind of message would that send?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, a strong one, hopefully.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(firmly)<br />
Yeah, everybody's going to be fine if they don't <i>panic</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Easier said than done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There they are.</blockquote>
<p>[A hive ship appears through the window.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(gasping)<br />
My God. How big is that thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Never seen a hive in space, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(panicky)<br />
I've never seen one, period. I mean, I've seen video logs, but never in person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(absently)<br />
Well, you never forget your first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They know we're here.</blockquote>
<p>[The console beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Apparently. We're receiving a transmission.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard peeks over to McKay's console.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Docking instructions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
What, no "hello, greetings, weary travelers?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Guess not. So much for the red carpet.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper flies into the hive docking bay.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The team look distinctly nervous and uncomfortable as they land inside the hive ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So, what happens now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, if history has taught us anything, this is the part where we get double-crossed and taken prisoner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That will not happen this time, Rodney. We were invited, remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grumbling)<br />
And that makes a difference?</blockquote>
<p>[There is a pounding on the outer door. Sheppard grimaces.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right on cue.</blockquote>
<p>[They all get up and head to the back. Sheppard hits the button to lower the door and raises his rifle. Three Wraith guards are standing outside, aiming weapons at the team&#8212;a standoff.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This looks a little familiar.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(to his men)<br />
Lower your weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[The soldiers comply.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(to team)<br />
My apologies. You understand. You can't be too careful. Welcome to my ship.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds his hands out in a grand gesture.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Todd leads the team to a room furnished with a long wooden table and several wooden chairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
This is my second-in-command. I've asked him to be a part of these discussions. Please&#8230;sit.</blockquote>
<p>[They cautiously take seats around the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm. Fruit bowl. Nice touch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Well, we picked them up on our travels. I thought it would make our discussions more&#8230;comfortable. I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks nonplussed and drops the fruit he holds.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's just get this over with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
So, I understand you have a proposal. A breakthrough of some kind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nodding to Keller)<br />
This is Doctor Keller. She's our Chief Medical Officer, and she's going to explain everything to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(clears throat nervously)<br />
Well, um&#8230;uh, as you may already know, we recently stumbled across a lab belonging to Michael&#8212;the Wraith that we&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I know who he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh&#8212;of course you do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Word of your success against him spread rapidly among my kind. We are very grateful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Trust me, we didn't do it for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Anyway, we recovered a database from his lab that allowed us to continue his research into&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(sharply interrupting)<br />
For what purpose?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We've come up with a gene therapy that alters Wraith DNA in a small but significant way. In a nutshell, we think we can make it so that you, and any other Wraith we treat, will never need to feed on humans again.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd and his second in command exchange sharp looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
This is absurd.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, actually, it's&#8230;not as big of a change as you might think. Your bodies already contain all the organs necessary to digest food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Here. Try this.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard tosses Todd a piece of fruit.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
If I consume this, it may give me a moment's pleasure, but it will not sustain me.</blockquote>
<p>[He sets the fruit firmly down on the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
But that can change. At least&#8230;in theory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
Why would we want this? Of what benefit is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, think about it. If you put yourself on regular food, you could give up all those tiresome cullings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It would give you a significant advantage over other hives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not to mention, I could stop waiting for the chance to kill you&#8230;in theory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
Our current feeding process gives us strength, our ability to heal, our longevity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, um, we're not entirely sure how this change would affect your, um&#8230;gifts. They may continue, although possibly in a diminished form.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Possibly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's difficult to know from lab tests. We can't be sure until we administer it to, um, live subjects.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, let's not forget that Michael spread the modified Hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more. I mean, no one knows for sure, right? Which means that every time you feed? You're taking a risk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Bottom line is, there's not enough food to go around. That's why you Wraith are at each other's throats, so&#8230;here's your chance.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd considers this.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive ship floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Todd and his second are now gone. The Atlantis team waits in the room. Ronon paces.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This is wrong. We shouldn't be here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know, from where I was sitting, things seemed to go pretty well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(flatly)<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(curious)<br />
You don't seem too happy about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was just expecting a little more resistance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, he hasn't said yes yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but something makes me think he wants to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And why not? It is a reasonable offer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why are we thinking of ways to fix them when we should be thinking of ways to kill them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've been trying to do that for four years. They're still here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(firmly)<br />
The Wraith may not deserve our consideration. But as John pointed out, we're not doing this for them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's something going on here. Something he's not telling us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
What a surprise.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla stand as footsteps approach. Ronon turns and primes his weapon as Todd arrives. Ronon lowers his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I'm sorry. Am I disturbing you?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives a falsely bright smile and gestures a welcome.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I have&#8230;considered your offer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I believe your idea has merit&#8230;if you can make the treatment work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It'll work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Of course, converting a single hive would be pointless. It would make little difference to the humans of this galaxy and would make us pariahs amongst our own kind.</blockquote>
<p>[While Todd speaks, Ronon lounges in a chair in an exaggeratedly casual gesture. He never takes his eyes off the Wraith, nor his hand off his gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a minute. I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
I do, but I may have&#8230;exaggerated my position within the alliance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He doesn't have the clout.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(sneering)<br />
Then he's no good to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
There's only one you need to convince. Among all the queens in the alliance, one sits above the rest. We call her&#8230;the Primary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The uber-queen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Convince her, and the rest will fall into line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then convince her!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
She will only speak with another queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And your queen was killed last year in the skies above Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Regrettably, yes. But the Primary does not know this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(incredulous)<br />
You&#8230;you bluffed your way into the alliance and convinced them you still have a queen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
They would not have accepted me otherwise. Up to now, I've been able to maintain this subterfuge, but a face-to-face meeting&#8230;that would be difficult. In fact, there is only one person who could help me.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks pointedly at Teyla, who stares back at him in surprise.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard are in his quarters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is crazy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Believe me, this is not a decision I am taking lightly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do you realize what he's asking you to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor Keller assures me that the procedure is completely reversible and will have no lasting ill effects.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not talking about the procedure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(quietly)<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, even if this works, even if all the Wraith stop feeding, you think they're gonna become nice and friendly overnight? No. They're going to have a massive technological advantage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You're suggesting they will enslave the people of this galaxy rather than feed on them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've seen the same thing happen in our galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You didn't voice this objection before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nobody was asking <i>you</i> to risk your life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My Wraith DNA makes me the only possible candidate. Anyone else would be detected by the queen immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's fine. But-but my question is, why now? The Wraith are busy killing each other. Why don't we just sit back and watch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Eventually, one faction will emerge victorious, and then everything will go back to the way it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But maybe not for a while, so we can afford to wait.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And if Todd's alliance is destroyed? We may never have another opportunity like this again. I admit, this may not solve the Wraith problem once and for all. But there are people alive today who will be culled in the coming weeks and months. And if I can save even some of them&#8230;I have to try. If not for myself, then for my son.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(over intercom)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is Sheppard, go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BANKS<br />
(into radio)<br />
Mr. Woolsey wanted me to inform you sir&#8230;he's here.</blockquote>
<p>[Banks looks down to the Stargate, where Todd, escorted by an Atlantis team, arrives through the active wormhole.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits up on a surgical bed, dressed in a hospital gown. Keller is in scrubs beside her. Other infirmary staff prepare equipment.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You sure you're ready for this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(nodding)<br />
As ready as I'll ever be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I'm sorry. I&#8230;I feel like you're being pressured into this because of my research.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am not being pressured into anything. And your research may save thousands, even millions of lives. Remember that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Todd and his guard escort approach the infirmary. Ronon blocks his path, glowering menacingly at Todd.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Can I help you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Just remember&#8230;if anything happens to her, there won't be anywhere in the galaxy you can hide.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Ah. Is that all?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sneers in challenge, but steps aside.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd continues on his way.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY SURGICAL WARD</b>
</p><p>[Todd enters. Teyla lies on the table, still conscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
How is my patient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
She's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Very well. Let's get started.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
Don't worry. He's just here as a technical advisor. I'm going to be performing the surgery.<br />
(to staff)<br />
All right, we're ready.</blockquote>
<p>[The anesthesiologist injects a syringe into her line. Teyla glances towards the observation room and breathes deeply. The surgery continues. Todd giving advice as they work and study monitors. Sheppard, McKay, and Ronon watch worriedly. McKay has to turn away. Todd nods, as does Keller as they work on Teyla.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits on a bench. McKay and Ronon pace.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When are we going to get to see her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Give it some time. Just relax.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't. I've had, like, three cups of coffee. I'm completely wired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(deadpan)<br />
Really? I hadn't noticed.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens, and Keller steps out. She is in her usual Atlantis uniform now.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
All right. You can see her now.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[The trio follow Keller to Teyla's bed. They stare at her, all looking disturbed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How do I look?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla speaks in a Wraith reverberating tone. Her face is mottled green with slits in the cheekbones. Her eyes are reptilian and yellow. Her hair is black. She looks like a Wraith.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Todd's hive ship floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;QUEEN'S THRONE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Now, assume your throne.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla unsteadily moves to the throne. She sits in it carefully, as if it might bite, then shifts in it, trying to get comfortable.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(angrily)<br />
Are you trying to get us both killed?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(puzzled)<br />
I do not understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
At the first sign of deception, the Primary will not hesitate to <i>slit our throats</i>!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(standing)<br />
You said she would sense my Wraith DNA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
(disgusted)<br />
It is not your "DNA" that concerns me. It is your manner. Your bearing. You project apprehension.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, given the circumstances&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
It may be understandable, but it is not acceptable! Above all, you must never show weakness. Now&#8230;again!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla juts out her chin in challenge.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The rest of Teyla's team waits in the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How long is this going to take anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Until Todd's satisfied she can pass as a Wraith queen. You know, personally, I'm not inclined to rush this thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's already too convincing if you ask me. Creeps me out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(squirming)<br />
She's still Teyla&#8230;underneath all that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe that's the problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I'm not any crazier about this than you guys. But the fact is, Todd's putting his life on the line, too. I don't think he'd go in there with her if he didn't think she could pull this off.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Resting. You'll be pleased to know we've received word back from the Primary's hive. We've been instructed to meet with them at their current location.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, what's the plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Once we arrive, we make contact with the ship and make our way over. Then Teyla will put forward my proposal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, your proposal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Believe me, the less the Primary knows about my dealings with the humans of Atlantis, the better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(cautiously)<br />
If she doesn't know it's coming from us, what are the chances she's going to buy it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Our alliance has recently been dealt a number of setbacks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(grinning)<br />
You're getting your asses kicked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Indeed. Although the Primary would never admit it out loud. But the one thing stronger than her pride is her instinct for survival.</blockquote>
<p>[He steps closer to Ronon, intimidating.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Todd's ship drops out of hyperspace. The Primary's hive ship already waits there.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The second-in-command is at the bridge controls. Teyla stands, looking nervous. Todd walks over, studying her bearing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Don't be nervous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(trying to sound haughty)<br />
I am not.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd studies Teyla for moment, then nods for the communication to be engaged. The Primary queen appears on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRIMARY<br />
(on video)<br />
So&#8230;at long last we meet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Indeed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRIMARY<br />
Many among my crew were beginning to think you didn't exist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You must point them out to me, so that I may remove all doubt from their minds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRIMARY<br />
(chuckling)<br />
That will no longer be necessary. Make your way to my ship.<br />
(hissing)<br />
And do not keep me waiting again.</blockquote>
<p>[The video-link shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
She likes you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(dubious)<br />
You think so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
It was as warm a reception as we could expect.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla rejoins the rest of her team.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How'd it go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Apparently, quite well. They are preparing a shuttle to take me over to the other hive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, we can pull the plug anytime you want. You just give us the word.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. We've come this far. I intend to go through with this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we'll be right here. If anything goes wrong&#8230;<br />
(clicks his tongue)<br />
&#8230;we'll get you out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(reassuring)<br />
But nothing's going to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(warning)<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(meekly)<br />
Which it won't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Hey&#8230;just be careful over there.</blockquote>

Rodney&#8230;quiet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(haughtily, to guards)<br />
Leave us.</blockquote>
<p>[The guards leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sounding more like herself, but still with Wraith voice)<br />
John, Ronon, Rodney, it is good to see you. But you should not have come for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why? What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will explain later. But you must not attempt to escape. You are in no danger. I'm now queen of this hive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait&#8230;what?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is a long story.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, we got a jumper here, we can leave right now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No! I must solidify my position first. It is the only chance we have to ensure the alliance will accept the treatment. Otherwise, this will all have been for nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[They consider this.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. We'll let it play out&#8230;for now.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sighs in relief, nods, and leaves. No one notices the bald wraith hidden behind the corner, who has watched the entire exchange.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRIMARY THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla exits a transporter and approaches her throne. The Bald Wraith appears out of the shadows.]
</p>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
My queen&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(startled)<br />
What are you doing here? Who authorized you to wait in my quarters?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
(smiling)<br />
I let myself in. I needed to see you in private.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(rattled)<br />
I do not wish to speak right now. Come back later.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
I'm afraid I can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am your queen, I command you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
You are not my queen!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How dare you speak to me like this! Remove yourself from my sight immediately!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
I saw you talking with the prisoners from Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And? I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
Oh, you may&#8212;though it is odd that you refer to them as prisoners. I overheard what you said to them. You knew them, and they know you. And I asked myself: "how is such a thing possible?" I suspected you right from the moment you set foot aboard my ship.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla has been looking more and more fearful. She tries to bolt, but the Wraith blocks her path.]
</p>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
And against my better judgment, I allowed you to remain on board&#8230;<br />
(draws his sword)<br />
&#8230;while you committed treachery after treachery! It was my duty to defend this ship, and I failed.</blockquote>
<p>[He swings his sword, but Teyla ducks, stabbing him in the side with her dagger. The Wraith backhands her with a powerful swing, knocking her off her feet and into the throne, where she knocks her head against the back of it. She is still stunned while the Wraith pulls out the dagger and drags her off the throne, throwing her onto the floor. He crouches behind her and holds the sword blade to her throat.]
</p>
<blockquote>BALD WRAITH<br />
I'm afraid your reign is over&#8230;my queen!</blockquote>
<p>[He is struck several times in the back by the Wraith stunner weapon wielded by Todd. Teyla scrambles away as Todd approaches. He bends down and breaks the Bald Wraith's neck, then stands.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
He'll not be bothering you any further.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(breathlessly)<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd grins and nods.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRIMARY SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Todd and Teyla walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
My hive arrived moments ago. I've arranged for Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, and Doctor McKay to be transferred there immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good. When do I join them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
As soon as this is all over.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PRIMARY THRONE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits on the throne, speaking imperiously to several columns of Wraith gathered there.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
&#8230;and thus I will be taking my leave of you and returning to my former hive. I am leaving behind my trusted commander.<br />
(gesturing to Todd)<br />
Let me be clear, you will still fall under my protection, but in my absence, you will heed his every order as if it were my own. When he speaks, it is as though I am speaking through him. Is that understood?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
Yes, my queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good. Then it is time.<br />
(to Todd)<br />
Escort me to my transport.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd bows.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
The queen departs.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith position themselves as an honor guard, making way for Teyla, who stalks out, Todd following.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRIMARY HIVE CORRIDOR</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Well done. I believe you've managed to allay all suspicions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />									
Just remember why we did this&#8212;to disseminate Doctor Keller's treatment to as many Wraith as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Of course. Although I think it might be wise to let matters settle for a time first.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stops and turns to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(suspiciously)<br />
How much time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Not long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You're not planning on going back on our agreement, are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
No, no. I'm just saying that to press such a radical agenda so soon after the change in leadership&#8230;well, it may invite unwelcome questions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Very well&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But bear in mind that as far as this crew is concerned, I am still their queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Oh, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will be watching you. And should you step out of line, I will not hesitate to make a reappearance&#8230;and have you removed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Permanently.</blockquote>
<p>[Todd curls his hands into fists impotently as he watches Teyla leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Keller approach Teyla's bedside. Sheppard looks concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What have you done to her, Doc?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla rolls her eyes. She looks like herself again.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Very funny.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Better. Still some soreness, but for the most part, it's gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Good. Well, I have rounds, but I'll come and check on you later. Make sure he doesn't give you a hard time.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla chuckles while Sheppard tries to look innocent as Keller leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure you're feeling okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No lingering desires to feed on anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Only on solid food. The blended concoctions given to me by Doctor Keller are not very satisfying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it's only been two weeks. Give it some time. Look, um&#8230;I haven't had the chance to tell you that what you did, uh, took&#8230;you know, a lot of guts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm just glad it worked out for the best.<br />
(takes a deep breath)<br />
Has there been any further word from Todd?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not really. We're supposed to meet with him in a few weeks about this whole gene therapy thing. Word has it, he's, uh, solidified his position as a "leader" of the alliance.</blockquote>
<p>[He makes air quotes on saying "leader." Teyla looks away, deep in thought.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you not find it strange that as a result of all of this, Todd now personally has control of that entire alliance?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think that was his plan all along, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The thought had crossed my mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Regardless, I think we're better off than we were before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. I suppose you're right.</blockquote>
<p>[She doesn't look confident.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get some rest. I'll come back and check on you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. Teyla studies what had been her feeding hand and looks deep in thought.]
