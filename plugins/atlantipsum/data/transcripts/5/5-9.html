<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[McKay primps in front of a mirror&#8212;fixing his hair and checking whether he looks better with his t-shirt sleeve rolled up or not.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(reciting as memory exercise)<br />
Neuraminidase inhibitor. Neuraminidase inhibitor. Neuraminidase inhibitor.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens. McKay straightens his sleeve quickly as Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(guiltily)<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hear you're going off-world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm, uh, assisting with a, uh, medical follow-up on M33-985, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
With Keller.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On your day off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, I can't go off-world in my free time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no, go ahead. I just think it's odd you're volunteering for goodwill missions on your&#8230;day off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf. It's a whole new, uh, you know, kinder, gentler Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at him suspiciously and nods; he leaves contemplating something.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay strides into the Gate Room, carrying only his jacket, which is casually over one shoulder. His face falls as he sees Ronon standing by Keller, who's packing a computer into her bag. She stands and turns, spotting McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(smiling)<br />
Oh, there you are! You all set?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay puts on his jacket.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with false brightness, to Ronon)<br />
You&#8230;coming too, are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah. Ronon offered to help out, too. So I just thought, you know, the more the merrier, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is there a problem?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, just, I was&#8212;I was just&#8230;no, it's nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Okay&#8230;uh, go ahead and dial, Chuck!</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate starts to dial out. Both Ronon and McKay reach for Keller's other bag and pick it up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. I got this. I'm good. I got it. I got it. I'm good.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon does not release his hold, and has a firmer grasp on it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You want it? You-you take that.. I got&#8230;my own stuff, that I'll bring.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, M33-985, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, Keller, and McKay walk into the medieval era village.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
So the people we're seeing today&#8212;as long as you avoid any physical contact, you should be fine. The contagion doesn't seem to be airborne.</blockquote>
<p>[Someone watches the trio from foliage near the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's wrong with these people again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh, it's a disease similar to one on Earth called influenza. It's been spreading throughout the village. Not too severe a strain, but&#8230;enough to put a scare into them.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ERRAN'S HOME</b>
</p><p>[Keller uses her stethoscope to check a boy's lungs while he lies in bed. His mother, Erran, hovers nearby. McKay and Ronon stand in the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He's caught it, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
Will he be all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(nodding)<br />
His fever's mild. So, plenty of rest, lots of fluids, and he should be fine. I'm also going to prescribe some medicine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(casually)<br />
Oh, a, uh, neuraminidase inhibitor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(impressed)<br />
Very good. Um&#8230;can I have a look at you too, Erran? Just to be on the safe side.</blockquote>
<p>[Erran glances self-consciously back at Ronon and McKay. Keller follows her gaze.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Uh, do you guys mind giving us some privacy? I think there's a tavern close by. Why don't you go get some lunch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
Oh&#8230;you want to&#8230;sure.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and McKay awkwardly take their leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;TAVERN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay sit at an outside table. Ronon is devouring his stew with gusto. McKay stares at his bowl with distaste.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's the matter? You don't like it?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay clears his throat and gingerly picks out a bone from his stew&#8212;setting it in the center of the table. Ronon shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You know, you don't have to be here. I'm sure you got plenty of stuff to do back on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oddly enough, I don't, actually. But, if you need to get back, then um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, I'm good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Mm-hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon picks up McKay's bone, then bites off the end of the bone and sucks the marrow between spoonfuls of stew.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OUTSIDE ERRAN'S HOME, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay go to Erran's doorstep and knock.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
You think we've given them enough time? I mean, I don't want to interrupt if they're in the middle of medical&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon knocks.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
&#8230;stuff.</blockquote>
<p>[Erran opens the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hi. Um&#8230;is Doctor Keller done?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
She's not with you? She finished with us, then left. Said she was going to join you at the tavern.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon exchanges looks with McKay, then walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh right. Very good. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay follows Ronon.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, M33-985, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay search the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Jennifer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(calling loudly)<br />
Jennifer!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Jennifer, it's Rodney. Do you read me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Jennifer!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Doctor Keller, please respond!<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Well, either her radio isn't working or she's turned it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She wouldn't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
Then what happened to her?</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, M33-985, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay rendezvous at the center of the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Checked up and down the street. No one's seen her. It's like she just vanished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That doesn't make any sense. I mean, she wouldn't take off without telling us where she's going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not unless someone took her against her will. Maybe you should go back to the 'gate, radio Atlantis for help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe you're right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'll stay here and check the entire village.</blockquote>
<p>[They part ways.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, M33-985, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller awakens to find herself leaning against a tree. A tall man crouches a short distance away. He has his back to her and rummaging through her pack. She notices her hands are tied in front of her. She tests the bindings then reaches for her missing headset. The man notices her movements and walks over. She shifts defensively.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(tightly)<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
If you'd stop struggling, I wouldn't have to stun you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What do you want from me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
And stop asking questions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I just want to know why you kidnapped me. How did you take me from the village? I don't even remember&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk pulls his sidearm, a Wraith stunner. Keller purses her lips and looks away, fighting back her fear. She looks back silently when he doesn't fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
Good. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon walks through another part of the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(into radio)<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yeah, go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I got some footprints outside the village.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches from Ronon's location to where McKay is heading towards the Stargate.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jennifer's?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Standard Atlantis tread. There's someone with her. Bigger prints, like my size. Looks like there was a struggle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Oh&#8230;dammit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Weird thing is, it's like they just appeared out of nowhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean "nowhere"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I mean there's nothing at all between here and the village, and then they just appear. Like they dropped out of the sky. Wait a sec&#8230; Got a single set of tracks heading into the woods.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to follow them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A single set?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not Keller's, the other guy's.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So what happened to Keller's?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon crouches by the tracks.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ah, these prints are deeper. My guess is he's carrying her. Probably knocked her unconscious, or&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
Oh, god.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stands and starts to follow the tracks.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm going to check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe we should wait. All right, I'm almost to the 'gate. I-I-I'll radio ahead, get a-a team here. Do a proper search.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That sounds good. You do that. Meantime, I'm going after her.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gives an exasperated sigh and double-times it towards the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I'm here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(smiling)<br />
I got two sets of tracks again. She's still alive.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M33-985 STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay has reached the Stargate. He gives a relieved sigh.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, great! That's great! All right, I'm at the 'gate. I'll get the search teams mobilized, join you shortly.</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate begins to activate from an incoming wormhole. McKay hides in the nearby foliage. Four Wraith exit the Stargate, splitting up. McKay starts to back away, but breaks a bit of wood as he moves. One of the Wraith hears him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, crap!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts running. The Wraith hisses and gives chase.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We got Wraith!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How many?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon turns back and starts to run towards McKay's position.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Four of them just came through the 'gate, and one of them's about to kill me!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gives a primal scream and shoots blindly behind him at the Wraith. The Wraith shoots his stunner, but misses. McKay is starting to falter, but continues to run. He takes refuge behind a trunk when he reaches a small clearing. The Wraith pauses at the clearing, trying to decide where to go. McKay, from his hiding place, hears the Wraith moving away. McKay risks peeking out from behind the stump, only to find the Wraith standing in wait on the other side.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh shi&#8212;!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay makes a break for it, barely missing being stunned. The Wraith tackles him to the ground. The Wraith stands over him. McKay shoots a whole magazine at the Wraith, but it keeps coming, pulling him up and pinning him against a tree. It raises its hand to feed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shoots the Wraith from behind with his stunner. The Wraith falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(breathless and relieved)<br />
Oh, finally! Oh&#8230;what took you so long!?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(drily)<br />
Oh, you're welcome.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay groans. Ronon looks at the Wraith more closely.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's a hunter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wraith hunter. They chase runners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I thought runners were extremely rare, like, only a few in the galaxy!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, so a few years we run into you, and now another one? I mean wha-what are the odds of that?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks around.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Where'd the other Wraith go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. They-they spread out into the forest.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon starts to run.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are you go&#8212;? Where are you going? Hey wait!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay, still breathless, follows.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, KELLER' S POSITION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
This is as far as we go on the trail.</blockquote>
<p>[He abruptly spins Keller to set her down against a tree trunk.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh! Where are you taking me?</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk sets Keller's packs near her. He opens one and starts pulling out more rope.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
At least tell me your name.</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk ties Keller's legs together.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
There'll be time to talk when we get there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(frustrated)<br />
Where?</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk starts making careful tracks up the trail.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<p>[He continues to make tracks. Keller hears foliage rustling nearby. She perks, alert.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(whispering)<br />
Ronon?</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith appears on the other side of the foliage. Keller stares petrified. She looks from the Wraith to her captor, making a quick decision as the Wraith fires its stunner.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Watch out!</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk taps his armband and disappears as the Wraith fires. Kiryk ends up behind the Wraith and unsheathes a sword. The Wraith turns just before Kiryk decapitates him. Keller watches in horror as Kiryk cleans his blade on the Wraith's clothes.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon is already speaking with Erran as McKay catches up.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to get your people to a safe place as fast as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
Why? What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We spotted Wraith in the area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
Wraith? Coming here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(out of breath)<br />
Hopefully not. It's just a few of them. We think they're looking for someone else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
But we don't want to take any chances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, have you seen anyone different in the village recently? Any-any newcomers? Anyone that looks&#8230;uh&#8230;uh&#8230;like that?</blockquote>
<p>[He points to Ronon, who shoots him a glare.]
</p>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We don't have time for this. Is there a place your people can hide?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
There are dozens of caverns surrounding the village. Our ancestors used them during the last culling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Good. Come on. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[They head out together.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller is again led along by the arm by Kiryk. She looks at the armband.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
What is that thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
Take too long to explain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Too long? We've been walking for hours now. Can I at least rest for a bit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(whining)<br />
Just a few minutes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
A few minutes to allow your team to gain ground on us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(quickly)<br />
What team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
You're from Atlantis. You're a doctor. There were two men traveling with you.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller stares at Kiryk for a moment, then breaks free and makes a run for it. She goes several yards through the forest before Kiryk appears in front of her, aiming his stunner. She stops short and gasps in alarm. He stuns her, and she falls unconscious.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST NEAR CAVERNS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay supervise the evacuation of the villagers.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Watch your step. Just keep going. It's just past that gully, you're almost there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's it. That's it. Mind your step, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[The large woman with short hair glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>LARGE WOMAN<br />
(insulted)<br />
Sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ma-ma'am, sorry. I&#8212;you have-have a&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She's already moved past. He turns to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That is clearly a mustache!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon glares at McKay. Erran is at the end of the procession.]
</p>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
That's the last of them. The village is empty now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Good. Go with them. Make sure they stay in the caverns. And&#8230;keep them quiet. Make sure no one makes a sound unless you hear from me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ERRAN<br />
All right. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[She follows the villagers.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Hey, maybe we should go back to the 'gate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, go ahead. I'm going to keep tracking Keller.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wha&#8212;I do not think it is wise for us to split up right now. We have no idea where the Wraith are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It takes too long to go back. That runner took her. We let him get too far ahead, we'll never find them. Look, if you want to go to the 'gate, go ahead. I'm leaving.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts off.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ronon? Ronon! I&#8212;oh, dammit! Would you just&#8230;Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay chases after him.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller awakens on the forest floor, still tied up. She winces as she tries to get up. Kiryk stands over her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
You done trying to escape?</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods in defeat.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
More Wraith close by. We need to keep moving.</blockquote>
<p>[He lifts her up easily with one arm, then leads her by the elbow through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You're not from the village, are you? I've never noticed you, and I pretty much met everyone. Are you even from this planet? You're the one who brought the Wraith here. They're after you, why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
I'm a runner. You know about runners?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
One of the men I'm traveling with&#8230;he used to be one.</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk stops short.]
</p>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
Used to be? That's impossible. Runners don't stop being runners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Yeah? Well, this one did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
Yeah? Well, how?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(earnestly)<br />
Take me to him, and we'll tell you.</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk stares at her, not trusting her.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I promise. Look, we don't have to be enemies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
Nice try.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads her away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay catches up to Ronon crouched down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! If you&#8212;<br />
(sees Ronon concentrating)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This is where Keller's tracks start up again. Look&#8212;smaller, shallower&#8230;Atlantis tread. These prints are bigger and deeper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The runner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Keller's tracks are uneven. She's either hurt or bound. Probably both.</blockquote>

Oh, you know, I think you'd be surprised, you know?

Yep. Large rodent. Big teeth. Uses them to chop down trees and build dams. Very industrious. I was with them for a few months before they asked me to leave, but, uh, I got the manual.

<p>[Ronon and McKay take off down the trail again.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;TOP OF CLIFF, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kiryk carries Celise over his shoulder. Both he and Keller are moving slowly.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(out of breath)<br />
Could sure use that teleportation device now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
There's a path down not too far from here. Stay here. I'll check to make sure it's still safe.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves Celise with Keller. She fusses with the child's blankets. Kiryk moves to a shallower slope and looks down. Ronon tackles him from behind. They fight hand-to-hand. Keller looks up, hearing the commotion.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Ronon? Ronon, wait!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay comes up behind Keller.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jennifer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(upset)<br />
Make him stop!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Why?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Kiryk continue to fight.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(screaming, frantic)<br />
Ronon, please STOP!<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Help me. Grab her!</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves Celise with McKay and runs to the battle. She reaches them just as Ronon's pulled his gun, and Kiryk's unsheathed his sword. They hold their respective weapons at each other's throats.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Stop!</blockquote>
<p>[Keller grabs onto both of them.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Listen, he just wanted me to help the little girl. She's sick! She's dying! We need to get her back to Atlantis! Ronon! Please?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sneers, then lowers his gun. After another moment, Kiryk lowers his blade.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jennifer, the-the&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He points to Celise's leg. There is heavy bleeding through the bandages. Keller immediately goes to the child.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Her sutures have torn. I need to re-stitch her before we can move her.</blockquote>
<p>[They can hear darts flying nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You've got Wraith looking for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Listen, you stand a better chance fighting them together than fighting each other&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Both men glare at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
I mean, obviously the odds of actually winning are still ridiculously low, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Not helping.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mumbling)<br />
I gotta go&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He points to where the packs were left and shuffles away.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He's right. This place is going to be swarming with Wraith. It's better off if we work together.</blockquote>
<p>[He steps away from Kiryk, leaving him clear access to his stunner, which had fallen during the battle. Kiryk holsters his gun.]
</p><p>[Keller quickly finishes re-stitching and re-bandaging the wound.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
All right, she's ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts picking up the packs and Kiryk picks up Celise. Ronon spots Wraith running towards them.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wraith!</blockquote>
<p>[He immediately starts fighting one who's come on him quickly. Another one rushes at McKay who fires his hand gun but cannot stop the Wraith's approach.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, crap!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith pins him against a rock and sets up to feed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
RONON!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon is fighting off two Wraith hand-to-hand and cannot help. Keller hits McKay's Wraith with a stick, distracting him from McKay as prey and uses the stick to block further attacks. McKay fumbles to reload his gun as Kiryk helps Ronon fight the other Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Shoot him!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I will!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay finally has his pistol ready and fires several times. The Wraith falls. Kiryk is able to kill one Wraith with his sword just as Ronon knocks the other one to the ground. Ronon holds out his hand, and Kiryk throws his sword to Ronon. Ronon plunges the blade into the Wraith and twists it. They look around, but there are no more enemies. Celise has slept through it all.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nonplussed, to Keller)<br />
Where'd you learn to fight like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
(awkwardly)<br />
Uh&#8230;been taking a few sparring lessons.</blockquote>
<p>[She gestures to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(flatly)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[More darts are heard overhead. Ronon pulls out Kiryk's sword.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We need to move.</blockquote>
<p>[The group walk through the woods.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I tried to stabilize her, but she needs stronger medication.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know, you could've just asked for her assistance as opposed to&#8230;kidnapping her!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He knows, Rodney. Here, I got you something.</blockquote>
<p>[She pulls out Kiryk's armband from her pack.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
It's a kind of teleportation device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teleportation? Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Well, it was, anyway. I kind of broke it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls out a small screwdriver and starts playing with the device as he walks. Up ahead, Ronon walks with Kiryk, who carries Celise.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is she family?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
I brought the Wraith to her village. She's the sole survivor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(empathetic)<br />
It's not easy&#8230;living with that.</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk shoots him a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't worry. We're going to get you out of this&#8230;both of you.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;RISE OVER STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The group reach an elevated area overlooking the Stargate. They see Wraith guarding the Stargate. Kiryk sits Celise down. She's awake, but groggy.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I count six Wraith on the ground.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
Six that we can see. Probably more in the surrounding woods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Want to make a run for it? Shoot our way through?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
The ships will be alerted as soon as the shooting starts. We'll be culled before we can even dial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're just going to have to take our chances.</blockquote>
<p>[The armband beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Hey!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
You fixed it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know about "fixed", it's more of a "patch" really. It's incredibly complicated technology. I'm not sure if it'll actually&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk grabs the armband out of McKay's hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey! What're you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
I'm going to improve our chances.</blockquote>
<p>[He places the armband on his forearm, where it fuses itself. The light turns green.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Don't go down there by yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KIRYK<br />
I'll be fine.<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Get ready to attack that clearing.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon stands watch.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, just-just-just, wait a second. All right? Look, I'm not sure if I've actually fixed it. You'll need to test it before you actually.</blockquote>
<p>[Kiryk presses the button and disappears.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. I guess I did fix it.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A Wraith soldier patrols the wood near the Stargate. Kiryk materializes and kills the Wraith before it realizes he's there. He disappears, then reappears near the DHD, taking out the guard there and using his gun to down two more.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;RISE ABOVE STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They see Kiryk fighting.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's at the 'gate!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Stay with them!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon runs to join Kiryk. McKay draws his sidearm.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kiryk is pinned down at the DHD in a firefight. He dials the Stargate between shots.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;RISE ABOVE STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
He's dialing the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kiryk dials the last chevron, activating the Stargate. More Wraith reinforcements run towards the Stargate as Kiryk shoots cover fire and escapes through it. The Wraith give chase, including two darts. Ronon arrives just as the wormhole shuts down.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;RISE ABOVE STARGATE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keller and McKay share sorrowful looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
We've got to get a move on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. Well, we'll take her to the 'gate, then I'll go back, tell people it's safe to return to the village.</blockquote>
<p>[Keller nods.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon stares regretfully at the inactive Stargate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Celise sits up in an infirmary bed, playing a duck hunter video game on a handheld computer. McKay hovers by her side.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, no, no. As-as they fly up, you want to-want to use that button there to shoot them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CELISE<br />
(scandalized)<br />
Shoot the ducks?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're not real ducks, obviously. They're just, you know, for pretend&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He looks to Keller for help. She's studying Celise's monitors.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Maybe you should show her a different game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Here.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes the computer to pull up a different game. Sheppard and Ronon arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, how's our little patient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
Oh, much better. She's a heck of a fighter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Celise, pointing to McKay)<br />
Is he bothering you? Because, I can have him removed, forcibly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CELISE<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, he's kidding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I talked to one of the families on 985, the woman's home we visited? She'd love to have Celise come and live with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CELISE<br />
Will I see Kiryk again?</blockquote>
<p>[The others exchange awkward looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELLER<br />
I don't know, sweetheart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're still looking for him. Keeping our eyes and ears open.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(smiling)<br />
Hey, I brought you something. I think you dropped this in the woods.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds out Celise's doll. Her eyes light up and she takes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>CELISE<br />
My doll!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Keller exchange smiles. McKay watches their interaction with discouraged interest.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS WORKOUT ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon twirls a staff around in a loose kada movement. McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, here's the thing. I-I've been thinking, and, uh&#8230;I need to know your intentions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(puzzled)<br />
Intentions?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
With Jennifer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't have any intentions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Oh. Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to go, suppressing a smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(under his breath)<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wait.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns back.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What do you mean by "intentions"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, are you interested in her in a&#8230;romantic&#8230;fashion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good!</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to go. Ronon leans on his staff.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wait.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay spins back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(angry)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Maybe I do&#8230;have&#8230;intentions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grumbling softly)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Do you have intentions?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well of course I do. That's why I was asking you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(shrugging)<br />
So what are we going to do about it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon smiles and starts shifting his staff.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not going to fight you for her, if that's what you're thinking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not going to step aside either! So&#8230;we're just going to have to&#8230;let her decide.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon is still smirking.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with bravado)<br />
Okay. So, may the best man win.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay steps forward and holds out his hand to shake. Ronon, still smiling, takes it. McKay swallows, uncertain.]
