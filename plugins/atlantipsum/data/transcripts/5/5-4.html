</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay leave the briefing room amongst other Atlantis personnel, including Lorne and Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm telling you, she's hiding him from me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's not hiding him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yeah? Every time I go to see him, she tells me that he's "just settled down."</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you blame her? You dropped him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I did not drop him, he jumped!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Jumped?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, he wiggled out of my arms. Look, I said I was sorry. Besides, how much damage could I possibly have done? He fell like, maybe two feet. Stuff like that happens all the time. I mean, I was dropped, like, a dozen times when I was kid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that explains a lot. Why do you even care? You don't even like kids!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the principle of the thing. Everyone else gets to hold him, why shouldn't I?</blockquote>
<p>[The have arrived at the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Colonel? We got a new contact. Looks like a ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
It's in orbit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, how come we didn't detect it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
I don't know. We didn't even detect a hyperspace window. It just appeared out of nowhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(studying his display)<br />
Hang on a second, we're getting IFF. It's the <i>Daedalus</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The <i>Daedalus</i>? How can that be? They're on their way back to Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(puzzled)<br />
Well, they were&#8230;or they were supposed to be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Chuck)<br />
Open up a channel.</blockquote>
<p>[Chuck punches some controls and points to Sheppard who keys his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, this is Atlantis. Please come in&#8230; <i>Daedalus</i>, please respond.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
They're not going to answer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because I'm not reading any life signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you telling me, Rodney? This thing flew here by itself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know how they got here, but there's no one on board. At least, no one alive.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A jumper flies from Atlantis towards the <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team is in the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel, we just got confirmation from Stargate Command. The <i>Daedalus</i> is in the Milky Way, on course and on schedule. They expect to reach Earth within two days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So, that's not the <i>Daedalus</i>, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well&#8230;not unless it can be in two places at once.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps the <i>Apollo</i>, or one of your other ships&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
They wouldn't be sending <i>Daedalus</i> IFF, plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or why we're not picking up life sign readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I'm taking us in for a closer look.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon leans forward to look with Sheppard and McKay.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper flies underneath the 304. The ship is badly damaged, with scorch marks covering its hull.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wow, do you see that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, some scorch marks. You think weapon's fire?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm. Well, wherever she's been, she's been through some tough times.</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm in the jumper beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(perplexed)<br />
I'm picking up an energy reading. It's coming from the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is it dangerous?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think so, but I have no idea what's causing it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you get the bay doors open?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If the ship's command systems are as familiar as the rest it, it shouldn't be a problem.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> HANGAR BAY</b>
</p><p>[The outer doors open and the jumper flies close to the entrance.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No F-302s&#8230;but&#8230;there's a jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You sure there's no one else inside?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
As far as I can tell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we're going in.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper flies into the hangar bay.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> HANGAR BAY</b>
</p><p>[The team exits the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why is it so cold in here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The ship's operating on emergency power. Some of the systems are barely registering.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(drily)<br />
Except for the whole "weird energy thing."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you do something about it? It's freezing in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(piqued)<br />
Oh sure, I just have to get to engineering.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You and Ronon are together. Teyla, you and I are going to check out the bridge. Radio me if you find anything.</blockquote>
<p>[They split up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard enter cautiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No bodies in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins Teyla, and they both look at the plaque on the wall for the <i>Daedalus</i>]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's the <i>Daedalus</i> all right.</blockquote>
<p>[The lights suddenly turn on.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
McKay, is that you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Of course it was me. Who else would it be?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smugly)<br />
you think we've got a ghost on board or something?</blockquote>
<p>[Behind McKay, Ronon causes a large metallic clatter, scaring him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Will you please not touch anything?!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shrugs innocently.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
What's our status?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The rest of the conversation switches between the two locations.]</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've restored basic power to most of the ship. It should be warming up any second now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. Check on that energy reading. Try to figure out what it is, all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(exasperated)<br />
I'm on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel&#8230;ship's log, last entry.</blockquote>
<p>[She types on a few controls. A woman appears on the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>SOBEL<br />
Preparations are almost complete. We've beamed down the last of our supplies and any equipment we think might be useful. I'll be taking the last of the F-302s down myself. Of course, we haven't had time to do a proper survey of the planet's surface, but it seems habitable enough. Plenty of fresh water. Arable soil. Not that different from our own. I realize our chance of rescue is slim. But it's become obvious that we no longer have a choice. This is Colonel Sobel, commander of the <i>Daedalus</i>, signing off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you recognize her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've never seen her before in my life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, it appears as if they abandoned ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. The question is: why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'll check previous entries.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts typing on the controls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Man, this ship has been through the wringer. No hyperdrive. Subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair. The shields are virtually depleted.</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm begins to beep.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What is it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at displays)<br />
It's the energy reading. It's spiking.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Something's happening. The energy reading. It's going off the charts!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Do something! Turn it off.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know how. Look, it's not coming from any of the main systems!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, this is Atlantis. We're picking up some kind of power surge coming from the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we noticed it, and we're trying to check it out ourselves.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
The levels are still rising.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel, should we send another jumper to assist?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Stand by.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard feel the ship rumbling around them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and McKay look around at the shaking walls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, that's our cue to leave. Everyone back in the jumper.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to leave. Sheppard and Teyla aren't out of the room before they're blinded by a bright light.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Gah!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> is surrounded by a bright light, then disappears in a blink.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
McKay, what the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
I have no idea, but the energy reading's gone back down the way it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Atlantis, you reading anything unusual? Atlantis, come in.</blockquote>
<p>[There is no response. Sheppard reaches over and opens the channel on the commander's chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Atlantis, do you read?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Colonel Sheppard, do you read? <i>Daedalus</i>, this is Atlantis, please respond.<br />
(to Zelenka)<br />
What the hell's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I don't know. One moment they were there, and the next minute, they were gone.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p><p>[The conversation switches between and the bridge and engineering.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney, I'm having problems with communications. I can't reach Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is distracted by a display.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a second. That can't be right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla approach the front window.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I just did a sensor sweep, and there's nothing down there but ocean!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe they cloaked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they wouldn't have done that without telling us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I don't know. Maybe there's a Wraith ship in the area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(insistently)<br />
I'm not reading anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are we certain it's the same planet? Perhaps the energy burst shifted our position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. According to our instruments, we haven't moved at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you want me to believe, Rodney? That Atlantis just disappeared?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I-I don't know. Just, give me a second. I'll figure it out, all right? In the meantime, I've managed to localize the source of the energy reading. It's coming from a hold on Deck Nine.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon heads out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, keep trying to reach Atlantis. We'll check it out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DECK NINE CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, Teyla, and Sheppard have met up and head towards the hold.]
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches from McKay's spot in engineering to the rest of the team on Deck Nine.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sheppard, I think I've got something. It's the residual radiation from the flash. It-it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window. But different enough that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think we're looking at a new kind of drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I thought you said we didn't go anywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We didn't. At least, according to the ship's navigational systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, a&#8230;malfunctioning drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe, just&#8230;hang on.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reaches the door to the chamber and opens it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team enters and fans out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh my god! Sheppard!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stand by, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you don't understand. I know what it is! Look, the residual radiation&#8212;it, it's exactly what we recorded when my double arrived on Atlantis from an alternate reality. I can't believe I didn't see this before!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon gestures to the far end of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sheppard, hey.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla come over.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(continuing)<br />
It's a drive all right. But it didn't move us through space. I think it's moved us into a parallel universe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stunned)<br />
That would explain a lot of things.</blockquote>
<p>[He, Teyla, and Ronon stare at alternate versions of themselves and McKay lying dead on the floor.]
</p><p>[Later, Ronon finishes putting a thermal blanket over the dead alternate McKay. The others are already covered. McKay is with the team now.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh, how long have they been dead for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The place was like a meat locker. They could've been preserved like this for months.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(disturbed)<br />
They look just like us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's because they are us. The alternate reality versions of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I feel like someone just walked over my grave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Take it easy, everything's fine.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay studies a computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is very bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This tablet belonged to the other McKay. They weren't part of the original crew. They came here just like us! Look, a ship appeared in orbit over their Atlantis. They came to check it out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That would explain the other jumper in the bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(very worried)<br />
The ship jumped in another reality, and they were stuck. They-they couldn't get back. Look, eventually, their supplies ran out, and they&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, all right, mystery solved. Let's move on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
Don't you realize what this means? They were <i>us</i>, and they failed!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(firmly)<br />
Well, they're not us! We're still alive! Let's go!</blockquote>
<p>[He leads them down the corridor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They reenter the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The answer's in here somewhere. Can you, uh, power up the systems?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;yeah, just hold on.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens a junction box.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He starts hitting some switches and the lights turn on, the equipment powering up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, that's a start.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon notices a sealed door with several warning signs.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's behind here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. That's a good question.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks over to the control panel and hits some keys. The door opens. A large cylindrical device is revealed. It spins slowly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you figure out how to control it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(piqued)<br />
Offhand, I'd say no. That's what the other McKay was trying to do, and he had&#8230;weeks!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fine. I'll start with his research. It'll&#8230;at least give us a head start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, that's better. We're going to look for supplies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wha-you don't think the other us would've already tried that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sternly)<br />
Get to work.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SUPPLY ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon scavenges through containers. Teyla enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Did you find anything?</blockquote>
<p>[He holds up a drill.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not unless you know a way to cook this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps we should consider going down to the planet to collect supplies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Nah, Sheppard says it's too risky. The drive could kick in and the ship could take off without us. Then we'd be stuck here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The others that we found&#8230;do you think their lives were very similar to ours?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who cares?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How can you say that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We've seen our doubles before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Eh, Replicator manufactured copies. These were real people with real lives! I can't help but wondering who might still be waiting for her back on <i>her</i> Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Do you mean, did she also have a son?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The thought had crossed my mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Look&#8230;.I, uh, I've heard McKay talk about this stuff before. And, supposedly, there's a million different realities out there, with every possible variation, which also means there's a million different Torrens. You going to worry about every one of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(considering)<br />
No. It's difficult enough worrying about one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'll bet it is. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[They leave.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ALTERNATE REALITY DRIVE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters, and notices the shielding door is closed again as McKay studies the computers.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why is the blast door closed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello, residual radiation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, right. Have you made any progress?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As a matter of fact, yes, we have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Me and the other McKay, who unsurprisingly, is a genius. Not only that, but it looks like the drive was created by yet another McKay from the original reality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, admittedly, there are problems, but it is still a monumental achievement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, so-so&#8230;what do we do? Can we just throw the thing in reverse?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than that. The first problem is navigation. They've developed a coordinate system to, uh, identify the various realities and allowed them to get back. But, uh, obviously that didn't work.</blockquote>

Obviously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing)<br />
That's not what bothers me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, it kind of bothers me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's power generation. I mean, jumping from one reality to another requires massive amounts of power. We're talking ZPM levels here. Obviously they didn't have one of those rattling around, so they&#8230;created a capacitor that's constantly drawing power from subspace.</blockquote>

Think of it like a-a tap pouring water into a bucket. When the bucket is full, the drive engages. Except this particular tap has no valve.</blockquote>

Exactly. Which leads me to believe they were tampering with it in a vain attempt to generate more power.</blockquote>

Not necessarily. Look, we know that the ship carries its momentum in real space from one reality to the next. Now, we may not have sub-light engines, but we do have maneuvering thrusters.

Hmm? Ah, it's not good. The main systems are completely fried. I'm going to have to do a full bypass.</blockquote>

Can I be of assistance?</blockquote>

Ahem. Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(calmly)<br />
Perhaps a separate diagnostic of the auxiliary system would be useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

I wanted to thank you, Rodney.</blockquote>

For what?</blockquote>

For not giving up.</blockquote>

Oh, I know what this is. It's your first mission back. Look, I am not about to let it be your last, okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla graces McKay with a wan smile. An alarm beeps. McKay rushes over.]

Oh, no, that's what I was afraid of.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>ALTERNATE SHEPPARD<br />

Well, the thing is&#8230;uh, we do have a few questions. See, the <i>Daedalus</i> we know was destroyed two years ago in a battle with the Replicators.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sorry to hear that, but&#8230;this isn't exactly our <i>Daedalus</i>. We're just&#8230;borrowing it for a while.</blockquote>

(slowly, over radio)<br />
Okay, I have no idea what that means.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

All right, <i>Daedalus</i>, good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

Thank you, Colonel, and one last thing. It's been a pleasure. You're obviously a man of great integrity, and a dedicated commander, and a very skilled pilot.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>ALTERNATE SHEPPARD<br />

<p>[McKay opens the door to the hangar bay. An alien lies in wait on the other side. It fires, striking McKay in the right arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah! Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />

<p>[Teyla pushes McKay out of the way as Ronon and Sheppard return fire. Teyla protects McKay with her own body.]

<blockquote>RONON<br />

<p>[He shoots another volley of fire. Ronon fires as well, finally downing the alien. Sheppard and Ronon approach, still shooting at the body to be sure.]

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not waiting around to find out.</blockquote>
<p>[The alien's hand falls away from his chest, revealing a grenade counting down.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Move, move move!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ronon barely get back out the door before the grenade goes off. The explosion forces an automatic closure of the hangar bay door as Ronon and Sheppard skid across the floor. An alarm sounds at a panel. The wounded McKay checks it out.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The explosion's caused a hull breach. Whole sections have been depressurized including the hangar bay. We just lost the jumpers!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Our stop is coming up, Rodney. It's time to get off this train!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked)<br />
Look, there's no way off!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Once we jump into our own reality, Atlantis will detect us, and they will send help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We broke orbit to get away from the fighters, remember? Look, we carry our momentum and relative position in space from one reality to the next, which means, by the time we next jump, we're gonna be, like, half a million kilometers out. They're never going to get to us in time!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We got C-4. I say we wait 'till we get back, and then blow the drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That could work, or it could tear a hole in the space-time continuum, not only killing us, but destroying the entire solar system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we better think of something fast.</blockquote>

Half a dozen, tops. Then it'll be completely inert.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. I hate to think of somebody else getting trapped inside that thing like we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, you know, I've been thinking about that. Now, true, the navigation system was flawed to start, but, um, the basic principles of the drive are fundamentally sound&#8212;</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Uh, it's pretty bad, but, you know, it's better, thanks.</blockquote>
