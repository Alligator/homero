<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey briefs Sheppard's team.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
As you may have already heard, we have received an invitation&#8230;or more precisely, your team has received an invitation to represent Atlantis at a meeting of leaders from various human populations throughout the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's this? A Pegasus version of the United Nations?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Mmm, nothing quite so formal. At the moment, it's more of a loose coalition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is there any advanced technology in this "coalition"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
No. But the IOA believes it could be an important first step toward interplanetary government. A&#8230;"federation", if you will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(drily)<br />
The Federation had ships. Look, what do we hope to gain from this? I mean, the only reason these people even know about each other is because they happened to inherit the 'gate system from the Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just because they lack advancement does not mean they cannot benefit from cooperation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She's right. It's about time people in this galaxy got together and stood up for themselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Against the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The Wraith are at war with each other, which is why the people trying to form this coalition feel the time is right. And they want <i>us</i> to be part of it.</blockquote>
<p><b>WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;STONE CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team are led into a sparsely furnished stone chamber lit by candles with no windows. McKay groans at the accommodations.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
The council liaison will be with you in a moment.</blockquote>
<p>[She shuts the heavy metal door behind her as she leaves. Sheppard sits on the wooden table and sniffs a fruit.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Wow. They're really, uh, rolling out the red carpet for us, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sure they're just trying to keep the details of this meeting secret.</blockquote>
<p>[Smokey gas starts to hiss into the room from a vent.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, guys? Not good!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Teyla try to cover their mouths with their clothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon blasts at the door to no effect. The room quickly fills with the gas. McKay, closest to the fumes, is the first to fall. Teyla soon after. Ronon and Sheppard try and pull the door open, but both succumb and collapse.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JAIL CELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team are lying on the floor. They awaken, groaning, to find themselves in a different room. The walls are stone and metal bars block the door.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We're not in the same room. We've been moved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the hell happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a good question.</blockquote>
<p>[Two men approach the barred door.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to men)<br />
What is the meaning of this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MYRUS<br />
It will all be explained shortly. The council wishes to speak to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[Myrus looks around at the team, trying to distinguish Sheppard from the group. Sheppard bites his lip.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is brought into a large curtained room. He's forced to step onto a wide wooden pedestal. Two men and a woman sit at a long table at the end of the room, facing the pedestal.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
I am Kelore of Latira. This is Shiana of the tribes of Santhal and Dimas of the free peoples of Riva. We speak on behalf of the Coalition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, if you wanted to keep this location secret, you could have just blindfolded me. I wouldn't have&#8230;peeked. I swear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, you stand before this council as a representative of the Atlantis Expedition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
And as such, it falls to you to answer the charges.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nonplussed)<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
You will be given ample opportunity to present your defense. And when all evidence is heard, we will decide the outcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell are you talking about? What is this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
The Atlantis Expedition has been accused of crimes against the peoples of this galaxy. This is your trial.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Woolsey jogs down the steps to greet Lorne's team as they return through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Major, what happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We're still trying to figure that out, sir. One thing's for sure, they're not in the village any more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
They wouldn't have gone anywhere else without notifying us first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Not voluntarily, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Take as many men as you need. Search the entire area. And keep questioning the villagers. Somebody there knows something.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne's team leaves Woolsey looking angry and frustrated.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This was supposed to be a meet-and-greet. Just cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, maybe a little dancing&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Subterfuge was necessary. You possess technology and military power beyond the scope of most of the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
Which is why you have been brought to a secure council. Only the members of this council and key personnel know the 'gate address.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
So don't waste your time entertaining any hopes of rescue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(exasperated)<br />
What is exactly that you think we did?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
According to our calculations, the Atlantis Expedition is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of over two million people in this galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've got to be kidding me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
Tell us about your first encounter with the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh. Okay. I see where this is going.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard folds his arms across his chest defensively.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
When you arrived here, the Wraith were in hibernation, were they not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not all of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I mean, they attacked us.</blockquote>
<p><i>EXCERPTS FROM 1.01 "THE RISING PART 1"</i>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[As Ford and others look on, darts fly through the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOS FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard walk through the forest. Teyla suddenly pauses, listening for the darts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith!</blockquote>
<p>[They run to the camp.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOS SETTLEMENT, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Darts fly over the camp.]
</p>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
Take that thing down!</blockquote>
<p>[A service member fires a bazooka and shoots down the dart.]
</p>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
That's one.</blockquote>
<p>[He and the man next to him are swept up in a culling beam.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATHOS CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard run flat out. A culling beam chases behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Get down!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard dives to the forest floor. Teyla is taken by the beam. Sheppard turns to face the danger, and sees nothing nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<p><i>END EXCERPTS</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
That was a scouting party. Not a culling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I didn't know that. All I know is they took our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
And you went after them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
You should have left them to their fate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, I'm sure that's what you would've done, but that's not how we operate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we went in, we rescued as many people as we could, then&#8230;we got out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
But not before encountering a queen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(reluctantly)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p><i>EXCERPT FROM 1.02 "THE RISING PART 2"</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is held down by the throat. The queen picks up the Ancient device in his pocket.]
</p>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
How did this come to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't remember.</blockquote>
<p>[The queen hisses and moves to feed. Ford appears and shoots the guard holding Sheppard down. The queen looks startled as Sheppard rolls out of the way.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Light it up!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Explosions rock the hive ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard impales the queen with the Wraith guard's large pointed device.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(hoarsely)<br />
That has to kill you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pulls the weapon out. The queen falls.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sir, let's go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
(rasping)<br />
You don't know what you have done. We are merely the caretakers for those that sleep. When I die, the others will awaken&#8230;all of them.</blockquote>
<p>[The queen dies. Sheppard drops the weapon and picks up his Ancient life signs detector.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What's she talking about? How many are left?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard checks the device. More and more life signs appear. Ford and Sheppard look up. Chambers across the ceiling light up, each one holding a Wraith.]
</p><p><i>END EXCERPTS</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
So you admit it. You woke the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
Look, sooner or later, they were going to wake up on their own anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
But not for generations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
You see, Colonel, most of the human populations of this galaxy have not yet fully recovered from the last round of cullings. As a result of this early awakening, several worlds have been driven to the point of extinction, their survivors scattered, their civilizations lost forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're out there fighting the Wraith day after day, putting our asses on the line!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
But the fact remains many who have been killed would be alive today if you had never come here. Isn't that true?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's it. I'm not playing this game anymore.</blockquote>
<p>[He spins to leave. Two guards step forward, blocking his path.]
</p>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
This is just the first of many charges. If you refuse to participate, it will be taken as an admission of guilt on all counts. And we will have no choice but to proceed to sentencing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you going to do? Put everybody in Atlantis in jail?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Obviously, that's not possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(triumphant)<br />
Hmph.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
However, we can refuse cooperation. That means no more trade, no more relations of any kind. Atlantis will be completely isolated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(caustically)<br />
No relations with the likes of you? Hm. I think we can handle that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
The Coalition grows in strength and influence every day. Soon enough, all of your current trading partners will have no choice but to join, and therefore, to abide by the ruling of this council.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
As for you and your team, an example must be made. Justice demands it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Justice? Is that what you're calling this?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
A suitable uninhabited planet has been chosen. If you're found guilty, you'll be sent there without any hope of return for the rest of your natural lives.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;JAIL CELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard has been brought back to his teammates.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Apparently, the, uh, planet they picked for us has just enough food for us to survive, so, technically, uh, it's not an execution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, and, uh, they took the DHD, so whoever comes through the 'gate&#8212;they're not coming back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
The <i>Daedalus</i> can find us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If they had the address, but-but, I mean, short of that, they'd need to search every solar system in the galaxy for a habitable planet, which would take all of like, what, like a million years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. Let's not panic. I've been to the chamber a couple times now, and&#8230;I'm beginning to get a sense of the layout.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The architecture is definitely different from that of the village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, we're on another planet. Judging by the fact there's no natural light or windows, I'm guessing an underground bunker.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
The guards?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, half a dozen or so. We're going to have to see if they change in shifts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't suppose there's any chance you could just convince them that we're not guilty. 'Cause we're not, right?</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at him doubtfully.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Aw, come on. There is no way the Pegasus Galaxy would be better off if we'd never come here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. But since your arrival, there have been setbacks. Lives have been lost. But there is hope now where once there was none.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, as much as I'd like to tell these guys where to put their little trial? We're just gonna have to play along for a while until we figure out how to get out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Lorne's team escort Myrus through the Stargate. A stern looking Woolsey stands waiting to greet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Mr. Woolsey, this is Myrus. He claims to be a representative for the new Coalition of Planets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Does he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MYRUS<br />
(hesitantly)<br />
Are you the leader of Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MYRUS<br />
Then we need to speak.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is back before the council.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what's next on the agenda? Did we, uh, step on the rose bushes on our last trip to Vedeena?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Perhaps you've heard of a plague that's recently swept through several worlds&#8212;a sickness that arrives suddenly, runs its course in a matter of days, and typically kills one out of every three men, women, and children wherever it strikes&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
There are those who believe it is not a sickness at all, but a deliberate poisoning. The work of one individual.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know who you're talking about. His name is Michael.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
It is said that he is neither human nor Wraith, but some kind of half-breed. Can you explain to us how such a thing is possible?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes a deep breath.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One of our people was conducting research. They were trying to come up with a way to solve the Wraith problem once and for all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>KELORE<br />
You found a way to convert Wraith into humans?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't ask me the medical questions. I'm not a doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
And this Michael was one of your test subjects?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
As a matter of fact, he was the first.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Blood pressure's fine. Pulse normal. You're bouncing back quite nicely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
Bouncing back from what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hello, Michael. Do you remember me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(bemused)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm Doctor Elizabeth Weir. This is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You serve under my command.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Your name is Lieutenant Michael Kenmore. You're in a private room off the infirmary here in Atlantis. Is that familiar to you?</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

We tried to convince him he was one of us, but he knew something was wrong. And then&#8230;he found proof.</blockquote>
<p>[Michael steals dvds from Beckett's lab.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MICHAEL'S ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Michael places dvds into his laptop computer. On the monitor, Beckett works with Michael writhing on the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />

<p>[Michael replaces the dvd with the Day Seven footage. Michael struggles against restraints.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(on video)<br />

<p>[Michael changes it out for the Day One footage. On it, Sheppard and Ronon hold a writhing Michael down on the bed. Their bodies block a clear look at Michael.]
</p>
<blockquote>MICHAEL<br />
(on video)<br />
You will die for this! Argh! Others will come for me. They will destroy you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(on video)<br />
Blah Blah Blah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(on video)<br />
They gotta find us first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're gonna need a name. How does Mike sound?</blockquote>
<p>[THe Wraith screams. Beckett rushes in. Michael shows the frozen video to Beckett.]

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
After that, he escaped. He went back and forth between Wraith and human a couple more times until&#8230;finally he settled somewhere in between.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
So once again, you admit your guilt. You unleashed this&#8230;thing on the galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We didn't just let him out the front door and forget about him. We've been chasing him ever since. Couple months ago, we managed to catch up with him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'm saying&#8230;now that I know what the game is, I can play it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[A guard leads Woolsey in. Kelore stands alone inside the room near the defendant stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Kelore, thank you for agreeing to meet me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
(to guard)<br />
Wait outside.</blockquote>
<p>[The guard leaves the two alone.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
It cost me rather a fine pocket watch that used to belong to my father to get him to bring me here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
You shouldn't have bothered. There's nothing I can do for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, maybe I'm just feeling generous tonight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
Speak plainly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
You're backing the wrong horse. We know you're connected with the Genii.</blockquote>
<p>[Kelore takes a deep breath and steps out of the shadows of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
I don't know what you're talking about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
We also know they're looking to become the military muscle behind the Coalition. We think we'd make a better choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
You? Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
Well, I didn't realize you had those kinds of ambitions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
We've been content to keep to ourselves up until now. But if it's a choice between getting pushed out of the game and taking a more active part&#8230;well, that's no choice at all, is it? Of course, for appearances sake, we can't be too aggressive. So we'll need someone on the inside to help push our agenda&#8230; Someone to whom we'll be very, very grateful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
(sighing)<br />
And how do I know you haven't made this offer to the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I think we both know Dimas will only be swayed by reason, and Shiana's going to vote against us no matter what. That leaves you.</blockquote>
<p>[Kelore stares blandly back at Woolsey.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Later, Woolsey is brought before the full council by the guards. He takes his spot on the pedestal.]
</p>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Mr. Woolsey, are you ready to face the final charge?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
The people of Atlantis stand accused of conspiring with the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(bemused)<br />
Conspiring?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KELORE<br />
We have reports that Atlantis has negotiated with the Wraith and performed military operations with them. It is said you have formed an alliance with one Wraith in particular.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Todd.</blockquote>
<p>[Dimas looks surprised at this admission and the label.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
That's&#8230;what we call him. This Wraith was imprisoned with Colonel Sheppard&#8230;by the Genii. The Wraith was allowed to feed on him. But, despite, this, Colonel Sheppard realized their best chance of escape was to work together.</blockquote>
<p><i>EXCERPT FROM 3.07 "COMMON GROUND"</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII CELLS</b>
</p><p>[The guards approach to get Sheppard and Todd the Wraith. They pull Sheppard to his feet and drag him out. Other guards pull the Wraith out and begin to attach the restraints. The feeding arm is sheathed. Sheppard pretends to collapse, catching the men off-guard, and slamming them both into the bars. The Wraith backhands one of his guards and uses the chain restraining him to choke the other, slamming the feeding arm lock against the wall until it releases. He starts feeding on the guard he chokes.]
</p><p>[Sheppard gains the upper hand on his two stunned guards. Meanwhile the other guard with the Wraith pulls his sidearm and shoots several rounds into the Wraith. The feeding Wraith screams in pain. Sheppard notices and grabs the knife on the belt of the guard he's fighting and throws it at the shooter. The Wraith continues to feed on the guard. Sheppard knocks his guard out and rummages at the guy's belt. The Wraith approaches and notices Sheppard now has a sidearm. Sheppard glances at the Wraith, then throws him keys. The Wraith frees his other hand. Sheppard grabs the other guard's sidearm and warily hands it over to the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which way?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TODD<br />
This way.</blockquote>
<p><i>END EXCERPT</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
(incredulous)<br />
And you continue to have dealings with this Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
We have&#8230;occasional contact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
(scoffing)<br />
You trust him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Of course not. But he has proven to be useful at times.</blockquote>
<p><i>EXCERPTS FROM 4.11 "BE ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED"</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
(voiceover)<br />
He helped us hold off the Replicator fleet long enough for Doctor McKay to enact a plan to destroy them.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The battle continues. Both a Replicator ship and a Wraith ship are damaged.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
Heavy damage in interior section.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> comes between the two ships and destroys the Replicator ship damaging the Wraith ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
Our shields can't take much more of this, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Hopefully, they won't have to. Get ready to transfer power from the beam weapons to the&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He's distracted from the view out the window.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Nanites start swarming from all the Replicator ships towards the surface of the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>APOLLO</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MARKS<br />
What the hell&#8230;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIS<br />
Son of a bitch. He actually did it.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ASURAS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The nanites swarm to the Replicator blob, which is becoming denser and denser.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ASURAS CORE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The room shakes violently.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um&#8230;we need to get out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(to marines)<br />
All right, let's go. Come on!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon leads McKay to the beam out point. They're beamed away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The team is beamed directly onto the bridge. McKay heads to Carter's station.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CARTER<br />
We should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point immediately. The planet's become unstable.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The ships leave the drifting Replicator ships and start heading into hyperspace. Below them, the planet begins to break apart. After they are gone, Asuras explodes, destroying the remaining Replicator ships.]
</p><p><i>END EXCERPTS</i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COUNCIL TRIBUNAL CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The fact is, we would never have defeated the Replicators without his help. I think it's safe to say they would have continued their policy of attacking human worlds. And by now, <i>everyone</i> in this galaxy&#8230;would be dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Kelore and Dimas appear moved by this information. Shiana purses her lips.]
</p>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Very well. As that was the final charge, we will recess to deliberate.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to rise.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
I'd like to make one final statement, if I may.</blockquote>
<p>[They remain seated and look to Dimas, who nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
The Wraith are in disarray, but that won't last forever. Sooner or later, one faction will win out over the others. And when that happens, they will turn their attention to this Coalition with a ruthless vengeance, the likes of which you've never seen. If you don't want us there when that day comes fighting by your side, then by all means, vote us guilty.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey stares mostly at Kelore during this speech.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
I need no deliberation. I say we get this over with now.</blockquote>
<p>[Dimas looks to Kelore, who nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey sighs and steels himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHIANA<br />
I vote guilty on all charges.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DIMAS<br />
I vote not guilty on all charges. It falls to you, Kelore. Yours is the deciding vote.</blockquote>
<p>[Kelore stares at Woolsey.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JAIL CELL</b>
</p><p>[Guards lead Woolsey back to the cell, leaving it open behind him. Sheppard's team approach Woolsey in anticipation.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well? What's the word?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Not guilty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sighing in relief)<br />
Oh, thank god.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
We're free to go.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ronon exchange relieved smiles. Sheppard reaches out and shakes Woolsey's hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I never doubted you for a second.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey smiles.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stands on the balcony. The door opens and Sheppard sees Woolsey approach. Woolsey is dressed in a dark suit and carries two glasses of liquor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ooh, nice suit!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Being back in the courtroom made me miss my old uniform.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're kidding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Not the job, just the uniform.</blockquote>
<p>[They both sip their drinks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, that's nice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, it seemed appropriate.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a cigar out of his pocket and hands it to Sheppard. Sheppard looks surprised, but Woolsey takes one for himself as well.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, uh, you going to tell me how you managed to pull this one off?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Woolsey snip the ends off their cigars.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Well, I'd say it was a combination of things: my legal skills, my eloquence, the indisputable logic of my arguments&#8230;and the bribe I offered Kelore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm.</blockquote>
<p>[Woolsey pulls out a lighter and lights Sheppard's and his own cigars.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
On top of that, I had to commit Atlantis to a much larger day-to-day participation in the politics of the Pegasus Galaxy. Can't wait to explain that in my report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Well, what's the point in being out here if we're not going to try to make a difference, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Let's hope the IOA agrees with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll worry about that later. For now, congratulations.</blockquote>
<p>[They clink glasses in a toast.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOOLSEY<br />
Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>[They both drink as they look out onto the lit cityscape.]
