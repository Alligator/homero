<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[Scenes from 1.07 "Poisoning the Well", 4.18 "The Kindred Part 1", and 5.08 "The Queen" are shown.]
</p><p><b>END EXCERPTS</b>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[A village of wooden and metal buildings sits at the foot of some hills. It appears to be at the level of early industrial development. Work carries on in the blacksmith's shop as Elson monitors progress. Several people go about their business in the village.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CLINIC</b>
</p><p>[Beckett uses his stethoscope to check a girl's breathing.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Once more.</blockquote>
<p>[The girl inhales and exhales. Beckett lowers the stethoscope and sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(deadpan)<br />
Bad news, I'm afraid. You'll have to go back to school tomorrow.</blockquote>
<p>[The girl giggles and Beckett pretends to snatch her nose, smiling. Beckett stands and moves over to Novo, who is standing nearby with a clipboard. They walk over to another man holding his side.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Maintain the amoxicillin for three more days; that should do the trick. Now, what do we have over here? All these bandages need to be changed. Do you mind going back to the store room and getting some more bandages, please?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
Yes, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Nola leaves. Beckett pats the man on the shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Besides that, you're looking good, my friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mail call.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett spins to find Sheppard and his team entering the home, carrying supplies.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel! What are you all doing here?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla grin.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we heard you needed supplies, so we thought we'd come by and see how you were doing.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon and Beckett good-naturedly pretend to spar. McKay is in the rear, carrying a large duffel bag and looking dour.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustically)<br />
"A hop, skip, and a jump from the 'gate?" That's what you call that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(grinning)<br />
Nice to see you too, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How are you, Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well. Thanks. I take it these are the antibiotics I ordered?</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a yellow case from Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doctor Keller gave you a whole whack of them. So they should last for a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(sighing)<br />
Ah, God. I wish that were true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, I've been dealing with a number of infections from the Hoffan plague survivors. I can barely keep on top of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Survivors of the Hoffan plague? Here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is not one of the planets that Michael targeted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, but many of these people actually come from another planet, Balar. They managed to survive the plague, and just when they started getting the pieces back together, the Wraith showed up; tried to wipe them out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(grimacing)<br />
Mm. We heard rumors about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the Wraith aren't too pleased to have whole populations out there that are immune to their feeding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Just a handful of the Balarans survived. The locals were kind enough to take them in.</blockquote>
<p>[Novo returns with the bandages.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Novo! These are my friends from Atlantis. Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon, and Doctor Rodney McKay. This is Novo. She's been helping me here in the clinic.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shoots Novo a winning smile and nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pleasure to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
You as well. I've heard a lot about you.<br />
(to Beckett, indicating McKay)<br />
Is he the one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The one what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
From all the funny stories.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's fixed smile falters. Sheppard and Teyla look amused.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(eyes widening)<br />
Right! Yeah, well, I hope you all can stay here for dinner. I mean, uh, the canteen's not fancy, but they do serve up one heckuva stew, made from a goat-like creature. Delicious!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Goat-like?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think it's a great idea. Gives us a chance to catch up and relive all those&#8230;"funny stories."</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and the team walk through the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So&#8230;how's life in the wilds of Pegasus? You got to be missing Atlantis by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Surprisingly, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, come on. The hot baths, Playstation&#8230;deodorant?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay wrinkles his nose as they pass close by a villager.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know it seems a wee bit rough, but it's not. Really. I mean, wherever I go, people are kind to me. I never want for a meal or a place to sleep. And to be honest with you, I'm really starting to feel like I'm making a difference.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shrugs. In the distance, a woman screams. Ronon and Sheppard push Beckett and McKay out of the way as they race towards the noise.]
</p><p>[A patrol of Wraith come marching into the village. Sheppard turns the corner then immediately dives back into hiding, holding back the others who try and see what he's spotted.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispering)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low)<br />
Wraith.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[The villagers stare as the Wraith arrive in the main square. Sheppard's team remain in hiding, watching and waiting.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(whispering)<br />
I count nine of them. We can take 'em.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(low, but firm)<br />
No. There's too many civilians.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I does not appear to be an ordinary culling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How do you figure that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, for one thing, there are no darts. And they do not seem to be attacking the villagers.</blockquote>
<p>[The soldiers part to reveal a lead Wraith standing in their midst.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Who among you speaks for the rest?</blockquote>
<p>[Elson exchanges looks with another villager.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
(calling out)<br />
I am Elson&#8230;leader of this village. What do you want with us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
You have recently taken in a group of refugees from another planet. They are survivors of a plague. It is important that you turn them over to me immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
The reasons why do not concern you. Provided you cooperate, you have my word we will leave peacefully.</blockquote>
<p>[Elson looks to Jervis and Renni.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
And if we don't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
(stepping forward)<br />
That would be a very unwise decision. Our hive will be here before the night is through. If you have not complied by then, I will give the word, and your entire village will be destroyed.<br />
(louder)<br />
Turn over these outsiders, and your lives will be spared. Resist, and you will all die together. The choice is yours.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith and his soldiers leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CLINIC DINING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team, Novo, and Beckett sit around a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
I don't understand. They've already destroyed our homeworld. Why would they hunt the rest of us down as well?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
You didn't tell them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Not the whole story.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Novo, remember when I told you that, as a plague survivor, you'd be immune to the Wraith feeding?</blockquote>
<p>[Novo nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, there's a bit more to it than that. Any Wraith who tries to feed on you or anyone like you will, as a result, die instantly.</blockquote>
<p>[Novo stares at him in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You're poison to them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
Then we're as good as dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not necessarily.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
They won't tolerate our presence anywhere&#8212;not if what you say is true!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just because they found you on this world does not mean that there is nowhere you can hide.</blockquote>
<p>[Sefaris enters with some others.]
</p>
<blockquote>SEFARIS<br />
Novo? Did you hear?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
Yes. This is Sefaris. He's also from Balar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SEFARIS<br />
The councillors are meeting to discuss whether or not to heed the Wraith's request.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(standing)<br />
What? Where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SEFARIS<br />
The mine office. I tried to get in, but they turned me away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon, Teyla, scope out the 'gate. 
(to McKay and Beckett)<br />
You two stay here, watch these people.<br />
(to Sefaris)<br />
Can you show me where this mine office is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SEFARIS<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel, what are you going to say to them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going to give them another way out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINE OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard speaks to Elson and the other councillors.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
You're telling us that, as a result of this plague, the Balarans are now deadly to the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pretty much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
So&#8230;the Wraith would never risk culling this village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mmm, that's true, but that's also why they'd be willing to wipe you guys out completely. A village that can't be culled's no good to them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Did they know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Did the Balarans know they were bringing this curse upon us when they came here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, they had no idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
It's not their fault, Jervis!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Maybe not, but that doesn't matter. The Wraith won't rest until every last plague survivor in this galaxy is dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Except the Wraith have no idea who they are unless people like you point them out.</blockquote>
<p>[Jervis bristles.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
I'm not happy about this either, Colonel. But what other choice do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well&#8230;we may be able to move all your people&#8230;to a different planet where they'll be safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
You mean leave our homes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I know it's not ideal, but the only other choice is to turn in a bunch of innocent people. And I know you guys aren't going to do that, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Well, as the Wraith said, they're outsiders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Jervis, we agreed to let them come here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
I didn't agree. Besides, they weren't a threat at the time. Now that's changed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
(crying)<br />
But they've become like family. Novo lives under my roof. She eats at my table. My daughter adores her! What am I supposed to tell her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
You'd prefer we all be killed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(breathless, over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Excuse me.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns away and checks his earpiece is secured.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon are hidden in foliage.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon and I are at the 'gate. It does not appear to be heavily guarded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's the same guys from the village. I recognize the commander.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINING OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are the odds of you two getting by them?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Pretty good.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla shoots a glare at Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Slim, actually. But much better if you and Rodney join us.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MINING OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, all right. Hold your position until we can get there.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns off his radio and heads back to the councillors.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELDON<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How many people are in this village?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELDON<br />
Uh, six-seven hundred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we'll be tight for time, but we can manage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELDON<br />
What are you suggesting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We take the Wraith out, get everybody through the' gate before the hive ship comes. You should be safe in Atlantis until we can relocate you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Unacceptable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
The Balarans don't deserve this. They did nothing but survive a sickness. It could just as easily have happened to us. If we turn these people over, we are no better than the Wraith ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, even if you cooperate with the Wraith, there's no guarantee they're going to keep their word. They may kill all of you for being an inconvenience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELDON<br />
All right. What do you want us to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Be ready to move. Take only what you can carry.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CLINIC</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go, Rodney. We're going to hit the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We are?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'll come with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not a chance, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I don't have time to argue. Besides, you've gotta get these people ready for transport. Once the 'gate's secure, we're going to have to move fast.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard heads out, McKay following.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(calling after them)<br />
Okay, but be careful.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right, if we're going to attack, we gotta do it from over there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Agreed.</blockquote>
<p>[They move through the foliage to another position. Before they reach it, Ronon spots something and signals Teyla to get down. They hide in the foliage and watch more Wraith soldiers march by. The Wraith commander with them pauses, Teyla raises her weapon. The Wraith continues on.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay head out of the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
As soon as we take the 'gate, we should call in some jumpers. It'll make evacuating the village a lot faster.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not to mention we can use the extra firepower in case the hive gets here before we're done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, let's hope it doesn't come to that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(breathless, over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yeah, go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We have a problem. More of the Wraith have begun arriving back. They must have been out on patrol.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
How many? Can we still get out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
For the time being, we're stuck here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay exchange worried looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINING OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay have rejoined the villagers.]
</p>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
You said you could get us out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, there are more Wraith than we thought. The 'gate's too heavily guarded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
(frightened)<br />
So we're trapped?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For the moment. I haven't given up hope. I just need time to develop a new strategy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
What strategy do you propose we use to defeat an army of Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(snappish)<br />
Well, I don't know. I haven't thought of it yet! Look, worst-case scenario, my team and I don't show up, the people back on Atlantis will dial the 'gate and contact us by radio. I can order backup.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELDON<br />
Will that happen before the hive ship arrives?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(conceding)<br />
Probably not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
We can't wait that long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For all we know, the Wraith could be lying about the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
And why would they do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angrily)<br />
I'm just saying, we need to stall as long as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
This is madness. Elson, we have to think of the safety of our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, I'm thinking about the safety of your people. All your people!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
(ignoring Sheppard)<br />
We can't rely on their help! We have to make our own decisions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
I need time to think about this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
The time for that is past, Elson. We have to act! And if you're not prepared to do so, then <i>I</i> will.</blockquote>
<p>[He storms out.]
</p>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
Jervis!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's he going to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CLINIC</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard arrives with Elson. Beckett and McKay are the only ones there aside from the seriously illy Balarans.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Novo and the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We sent them home. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(gesturing to the infirm)<br />
Can these people walk?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, if need be, but&#8230;I thought we couldn't get them through the 'gate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we can't for the time being. But&#8230;I don't think they're safe here either.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;BLACKSMITH SHOP, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Jervis meets some workers at the blacksmith's shop.]
</p>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Grab your weapons! Come with me.</blockquote>
<p>[Someone tosses Jervis a shotgun. Others are armed with flintlocks, scythes, pitchforks, and other weapons. They start storming the village, grabbing Balarans, whether they be men, women, or children, and herding them together. Jervis heads to Renni's house. She blocks their path.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
No, no! Please, please don't kill me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Get out of my way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RENNI<br />
She's not here, Jervis.</blockquote>
<p>[Jervis pushes her aside and bursts in. No one is there.]
</p>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Where is she?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Novo and Sefaris hide in the village outskirts as Jervis's men walk past.]
</p>
<blockquote>SEFARIS<br />
What are we going to do, Novo?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVO<br />
We have to get out of the village.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to leave but find their way barred by some of Jervis's men. They turn to run the other way, but are blocked in and surrounded.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CLINIC</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon arrive. The others are packing.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What the hell's going on out there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Some of the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, let's go stop them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
First things first. We've got to move these people. Grab some gear.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ronon start to help. The door bangs open and Jervis and some of his men enter with their guns. Sheppard's team raise their own weapons in a standoff.]
</p>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
We don't want any trouble, just hand over the Balarans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Don't make things difficult, Colonel. You had your chance to save the village; now it's my turn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(scornfully)<br />
Saving the village? That's what you call this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
This isn't your affair! It's up to us to decide how to deal with the situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
(calm but stern)<br />

Well, I have nothing to say to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
You were right all along. I should have listened to you.</blockquote>
<p>[Jervis looks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
The Atlanteans have no idea what they're doing. They claim to have a plan, but in reality, they're just putting all our lives at risk.</blockquote>
<p>[Jervis stands and walks over to the bars.]
</p>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Well&#8230;it's a little late now, isn't it?</blockquote>
<p>[Elson holds up the keys.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
Is it? If you went to the Wraith at the 'gate right now, do you think you could get them to honor the original deal?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
It's possible. But&#8230;I'd have to deliver all of the remaining outsiders at once.</blockquote>
<p>[Elson stiffens and swallows.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
They're in the mine. Hiding in the main chamber.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
(shrewdly)<br />
Are the other councillors on board with this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
The less they know about it, the better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
And you? Can you reconcile this with your conscience?</blockquote>
<p>[Elson appears to swallow in distaste.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
Leave that to me. You just make that deal.</blockquote>
<p>[Elson leaves the keys on the bars and heads away. Jervis picks up the keys and considers this information.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith second in command strides to the commander's quarters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p>[The guard opens the door to reveal the commander dead inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;COMMANDER'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[The second enters and looks at his dead leader.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
Search the ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR JUNCTION</b>
</p><p>[Beckett backs up close to McKay's console.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How long's this going to take, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do I rush you while you're performing complicated surgery?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, it's been known to happen.</blockquote>
<p>[The panel beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, I'm in. Now, just need a few minutes to disable the&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Wraith soldiers arrive and start to fire on them. McKay and Beckett duck behind the console for cover.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, geez! I think they found us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You figure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you're going to have to hold them off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(dubious)<br />
Am I, now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, come on, Carson. You can do this, all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right&#8230;on-on three.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How about on one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RODNEY<br />
Right. And&#8230;one!</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett rises and starts firing on the soldiers as McKay stands and tries to type at the console.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How's it coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Almost there.</blockquote>
<p>[He types frantically. Beckett is able to down a few Wraith, but more arrive all the time.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I can't hold them off forever, Rodney. We have to go, now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, that's it! I got it! Let's go!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Beckett run back the way they came, the Wraith in pursuit.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The dart bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You know how to fly a dart?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I've flown jumpers before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've been to Tokyo before. It doesn't mean I can speak Japanese.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, how hard can it be?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pauses at another junction, looking at different choices.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Do you even know where you're going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I pulled up a schematic of the ship on that console.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What? While we were being fired upon?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP DART BAY</b>
</p><p>[They reach the dart bay. McKay seals the door shut from the inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, that's sealed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How long do you think it'll hold them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not very.</blockquote>
<p>[They stare, overwhelmed at the scale of the large dart bay, which reaches up out of sight. McKay snaps out of his reverie first and heads to a dart.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, come on.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay hops into the cockpit. Beckett climbs in after him, trying to squeeze into the one-person unit.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What are you doing?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm getting in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we can't both fit in here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're damn right, I can. Now, shove over!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay grunts and tries to squeeze himself smaller. He looks very uncomfortable. Beckett is barely in the seat, his knees up against his chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
You comfy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(drily)<br />
Peachy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grunting under his breath)<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay waits, pressing a button on the joystick to no effect.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What are you waiting for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it should just start up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, it didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(exasperated)<br />
Yeah, I know that. But it doesn't make any sense. I mean, a canopy should form over our head. Maybe there's some kind of a weight limit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(insulted)<br />
What's that supposed to mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, because there's two of us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, maybe you need a key or something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not a Volkswagen, Carson! Okay, look, these are obviously the flight controls. That makes <i>that</i> propulsion, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How did you come up with that brilliant conclusion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It was just common sense!<br />
(he tries to force a control, and growls)<br />
Oh, come on!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(rolling his eyes)<br />
Right. Common sense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, well what do you want from me? It's not like there's labels!</blockquote>
<p>[They hear blasts outside the sealed door.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, not good!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're telling me. We need a new plan, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know. I'm thinking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, whatever you do, think fast, because if those Wraith come through that door, we're both dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Wraith continue to try to blast the door open.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP DART BAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, we need to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where? I mean, we're trapped in here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, then we need to find a place to hide. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs McKay's jacket and tries to tug him with him. McKay suddenly looks inspired, and Beckett notices his expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have another idea. It's a long shot, but it might work&#8230;but you're going to have to get off me.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett scrambles to get out of the dart cockpit.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MINE</b>
</p><p>[Jervis and his men lead a Wraith patrol through the mine tunnel.]
</p>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
Once you've taken these people, you're going to leave the village, right? For good?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
This place is of no concern to us. All we want is the Balarans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
There's a large chamber up ahead. That's where they're hiding.</blockquote>
<p>[They reach the large chamber of the mine. It is empty except for Jervis's team and the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Where are they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JERVIS<br />
(stammering)<br />
I don't understand. He said they were here! I&#8230;they should be right here!</blockquote>
<p>[They look around in confusion. The Wraith spots something lit on the ground. He picks it up and shows it to Jervis. It is a block of C-4 with a detonator activated on it.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
What is this?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PASTURE OVER MINE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The pasture sinks in the implosion that destroys the mine. Ronon, Teyla Sheppard, and Elson and Balarans watch from a distance the smoke rise, Sheppard closing closing the safety cover on the detonator control for the explosives.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Think we killed enough Wraith to make a difference?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Guess we'll find out.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes a deep breath and bites his lip, glancing back at Elson.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nice work.</blockquote>
<p>[Elson glances at Sheppard, his expression deeply grieved.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The second in command arrives on the bridge. A Wraith technician works his console.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
We have received word of an explosion on the planet that's killed several of warriors. The humans continue to attack our troops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
They're trying to escape. Target the area around the portal and open fire.</blockquote>
<p>[The technician types some commands.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
Weapons aren't responding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
What?!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon, and some of the natives are engaged in a firefight with Wraith near the Stargate. Several Wraith have been killed. Finally the last one is downed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
Dial the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p>[She runs to the DHD. Sheppard runs back to the foliage where Elson and the Balarans wait out the battle; he loads a new magazine into his weapon as he moves.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
This is the first group. There are more coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, we've got to move fast. They're not going to take this lying down. Let's go!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leads the way. Elson stays put and points the refugees to follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELSON<br />
All right. Come on, let's go. Stay low. Stay low.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla dials the Stargate, then watches warily for more Wraith.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE SHIP BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
We've lost contact with the troops at the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
What about the two human prisoners?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH TECHNICIAN<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
They're nowhere to be seen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH SECOND<br />
They couldn't have just disappeared&#8230; It doesn't matter. We can't let the villagers escape. Launch the darts.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE AREA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[All the villagers move in a hurried but orderly procession towards the Stargate. Teyla spots darts approaching. She raises her rifle.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go, go, go! Move!</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers run as the darts approach. Teyla and Sheppard open fire. Ronon fires his blaster at the darts while pushing the stragglers towards the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, crap!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard dives into a roll, barely missing being caught in a culling beam. Teyla fires as it flies overhead, then spots some women coming from the woods. She hurries towards them. Ronon sees more darts closing in from another position.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sheppard! We've got more coming!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla urges the women forward, covering their rear.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Go, go, go! You're almost there!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sees a dart nearing Teyla's position.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<p>[He rushes forward. Teyla pauses to shoot. The culling beam activates, but instead of pulling Teyla up, it dematerializes McKay and Beckett in front of her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(stunned)<br />
Rodney! Carson!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh my god, it worked!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, you're a genius.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What'd you do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
I reprogrammed the culling beam to dematerialize us, then to discharge only from that point on. I mean, once the Wraith lost their weapons, I knew it was just a matter of time before they launched the darts.</blockquote>
<p>[While McKay speaks, Teyla pushes them towards the Stargate. The last of the villagers runs into the Stargate, Teyla, McKay, and Beckett follow. Ronon and Sheppard cover their rear, shooting until everyone's safe. ]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Ronon enter the Stargate just before a culling beam reaches them. The wormhole shuts down.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett works at a computer. McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There you are! I've been calling you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh! I'm sorry. What's up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lorne's team just found a suitable planet for the villagers. They're going to move them out this afternoon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, I heard. I'm going with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Oh. Right. Of course. Um, well&#8230;you want to uh&#8230;grab some lunch? I mean, we didn't get any chance to socialize this time around, unless you count, you know, running through the halls of the hive ship as&#8230;social time.</blockquote>
<p>[He shoots Beckett a wry smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, you're right. Look, Rodney, I'd love to, but I really need to get through this.</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures to the computer screens. McKay moves around the table to look at them too.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Doctor Keller's research on the serum that keeps my cells from deteriorating. I think there might be something in here to help the plague survivors, since I'm not getting the infections that they are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you don't have do this now! I'll download the data to a drive. You can just, you know, take it with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Actually, you can't. Mr. Woolsey doesn't want it leaving the base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(grimacing)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Sorry, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(failing not to sound hurt)<br />
Well, I don't care. No, I was just, you know, trying to stop you from whining about never seeing me. All right.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to leave. Beckett sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, wait.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pauses and turns back.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Now that I think of it, I am a wee bit peckish. Besides, I can't solve all the galaxy's problems in one day, can I?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay points to himself and shrugs with false humility.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Shut it. Right, let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett shuts his laptop and grabs his jacket, joining McKay as they walk out of the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
So? Interested in anyone these days?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stammering)<br />
Me? No. I-um, I don't have time for that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(grinning, sly)<br />
You're a terrible liar, Doctor McKay. Tell me, tell me, tell me.</blockquote>
