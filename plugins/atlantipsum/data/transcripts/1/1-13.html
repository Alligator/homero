<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR IN LOWER LEVELS OF ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Zelenka, Ford, and Hays explore the area using flashlight. The floors are wet, indicating they are on a lower level.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
7,549.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, please. Prime. 4,021.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Ah, nice try. Not prime. Okay, Lieutenant Ford, 599.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't care if it's a prime number or not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, come on. Yes or no?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's incredible. Ten for ten.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He is terrible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So I suck at prime/not prime. Somehow I'm going to sleep tonight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
At this point, it's gone way beyond you not knowing your prime numbers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a true/false game. Statistically, just by guessing, you should be getting at least half of these right. Look, 993.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Prime.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, come on. That's an easy one. Are you hearing this, Hays?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAYS<br />
Not really. I guess I've been too busy doing my job.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've already been through this section of Atlantis, Dr. Killjoy. It's structurally sound.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(starting to laugh)<br />
Lieutenant Ford, would you mind being a subject of research paper on statistical improbabilities?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
This this some sort of payback for guys like me beating up guys like you in high school, right?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS EAST PIER</b>
</p><p>[Technicians and scientists pack up their equipment. McKay and his team arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
So, Rodney, what's it like out there in the suburbs today?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Essentially, with the exception of the upper-level storage room, which the lovely and talented Dumais informs me is in no immediate danger, this pier is in relatively good shape.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir is in the control room, working on a tablet computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Even after all the flooding from the storm?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS EAST PIER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, it's dark, it's damp, and it smells terrible, but from an engineering standpoint, we're good.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Head back.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS EAST PIER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Heading back.<br />
(speaking up to assembled scientists)<br />
All right, you clowns, listen up. I don't often get a chance to say this, so savor it: Good work, boys and girls. Let's go home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(looking at his tablet computer)<br />
Wait, wait, wait. We're missing Johnson and Wagner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Wagner, Johnson, what's your position?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JOHNSON<br />
(over radio, frantic)<br />
We need backup! They're coming at us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Where are they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(consulting tablet)<br />
Down this corridor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're on our way!</blockquote>
<p>[They all rush out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR EAST PIER</b>
</p><p>[Wagner lies on the floor. Johnson, a female, sits huddled nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Johnson. Johnson, are you okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford checks Wagner.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
McKay, he's dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Johnson, what happened here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JOHNSON<br />
(crying)<br />
They got him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who got him?</blockquote>
<p>[Terrified, she stands up, pushing herself against the wall, looking at something over McKay's shoulder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Calm down. There's nothing here.</blockquote>
<p>[She strikes out with her hands as if batting something away.]
</p>
<blockquote>JOHNSON<br />
Can't you see them? They're everywhere!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Beckett, I need a medical team down here, STAT.</blockquote>
<p>[She falls back to the floor, Zelenka and another scientist trying to help her. She grabs her head in pain and screams, then falls silents. She is bleeding from her nose and mouth. Zelenka checks her pulse, then shakes his head.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's no use. She's gone.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and the others react with shock.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MEDICAL LAB</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and other medical personnel are working.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
McKay, this is Dr. Beckett. What exactly is the nature of the emergency?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR NEAR EAST PIER</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between Beckett and McKay's positions over the radio.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's too late. They're gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Who's gone? How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Wagner and Johnson. I need a containment team here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
A containment team? Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
People don't just see things and drop dead, Lieutenant. We've spent the last hour surveying unexplored areas of the city. I think Wagner and Johnson were exposed to something&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And if they were infected, there's a very good chance that we were too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I recommend a level-four quarantine until we know what we're dealing with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Agreed.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Carson, you hear all that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Aye. We'll get into our HAZMAT gear and head down. Sit tight. I'll make sure Dr. Weir is briefed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Thank you very much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(to other medical personnel)<br />
Okay, you heard the man. Follow me, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR NEAR EAST PIER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>PETERSON<br />
So wait, what? We're just going to stay here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's the plan. Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PETERSON<br />
May I say it's a terrible one?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you may not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PETERSON<br />
I think we should get the hell out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
If it is an airborne agent, we may already be infected. Heading back to the city would only endanger the rest of the population.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PETERSON<br />
But what if we're not infected yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no way of knowing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PETERSON<br />
But I feel fine. I feel perfectly fine!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
End of discussion. Peterson, we're staying here. Actually, wait a second.<br />
(snapping his fingers in realization of something)<br />
Everyone, follow me.</blockquote>
<p>[They follow McKay out. Peterson hesitates, but two soldiers smile at him menacingly and he leaves as well.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Grodin briefs Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
They've begun to institute a level-four quarantine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It can't really be a biological infection, can it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
I have no idea what it is&#8230; But I agree we should play it safe and initiate self-regulated quarantine in all populated sections of the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's pretty severe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
We've known for some time that the Ancients suffered from a plague. If McKay and his team have somehow stumbled upon it and become infected, we'll need to take every precaution to prevent an outbreak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right. We will suspend any and all gate activity and keep everyone where they are, again, just until we have a clearer picture of exactly what it is that killed Wagner and Johnson.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TRAINING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard spar with bantos rods. Teyla appears to have the upper hand after each encounter. In the third, she hits him in the arm and then the rear several times, finally pushing him to his knees with her bantos rods against his neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(as she hits him)<br />
Ahh! Ooh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You have not been practicing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, I have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If this was really a fight&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If this was really a fight, I would have shot you by now.</blockquote>
<p>[Annoyed, she lets him go and pushes him away. They walk over to gather their gear from a bench.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, no matter how many hours I put into this, you're still going to kick my ass.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is not for the winning that we practice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what's the point?</blockquote>
<p>[The are approaching the door when they hear Weir's voice over the intercom.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
May I have everyone's attention, please. We have run into a questionable medical situation, and at Dr. Beckett's suggestion, we have decided to put the city into a self-regulated quarantine. For at least the next couple of hours, I need everyone to stay where they are and report anyone moving freely through the halls. I hope you’ll understand. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell is this?<br />
(checking his back for his radio)<br />
Did you bring your radio?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla starts to look for hers.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR NEAR EAST PIER</b>
</p><p>[The entire groups moves through the corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Isn't this the same section Wagner and Johnson were exploring?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So we're retracing their steps?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's right. Don't worry. My motivations are based entirely on self-preservation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PETERSON<br />
Wait, wait, wait. Ford's right. Doesn't this increase our chances of getting infected?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. Let me spell this out for you, okay? If there is a bacterial agent and it is not airborne, then it should be relatively safe for us to look around as long as we take the proper precautions. However&#8230;if it is an airborne agent, then there's a very good chance we've already been infected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, shouldn't we wait for Dr. Beckett to decide that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Those men were only down there for 12 hours. Even if they were infected right away, that's an alarmingly short incubation period. Now, if anyone else is infected, as in, oh, I don't know, maybe us? Seconds are going to count, Lieutenant. All right, light.<br />
(taking a flashlight)<br />
Let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[They move along. McKay finds an open door into a room with some lighted tables.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everybody, stay here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford steps away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You just told me to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everybody except Ford stay here. You think I'm going in there by myself? Uh-uh.</blockquote>
<p>[They go inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[Many components in the room are broken, and there are pieces of glass on the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't touch anything.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay realizes he is looking at long, broken tubes sitting inside a fixture. Some still have a white substance in them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is not good.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;TRAINING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard paces, using Teyla's radio to speak to Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm ranking military officer here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, I'm aware of that, Major. You were off radio, and we had to act quickly. Now, this is all protocol that was put into place long before this expedition even began. Bates is here with me, and we agreed this was the best plan of action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right. All right. Teyla and I are coming up to join you.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between Sheppard and Weir's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're in a self-regulated quarantine, Major. Everyone stays where they are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
They're nearly a mile away on the east pier. Do you really think I'm in any sort of danger walking from here to the control room?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
At this point, we don't know where they contracted the virus. This is a medical situation, John. Only authorized personnel in hazmat suits are allowed to roam freely. Those rules apply to everyone, including you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, then get someone to bring me a hazmat suit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Everyone in hazmat is busy configuring the lab to deal with a possible outbreak. Now, if an opportunity arises, I will send someone to come get you, but in the meantime, radio contact will have to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right. Just&#8230;keep us in the loop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Will do.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[The rest of the group has entered.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Any number of these smashed and open containers could have released the virus that killed Johnson and Wagner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
And how would something like that survive for all these years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DUMAIS<br />
Viruses can remain dormant for long periods.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm hoping the answer will be found in the database. Okay, I think that we have to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka approaches McKay, who is working at a laptop connected to the lap equipment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Doesn't appear to be networked in with the rest of the Ancient systems. In fact, if you look, it only contains information about the experiments that took place in this room.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Weir, it's McKay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir walks with Bates.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead, Rodney.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Where's Beckett?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between Sheppard and Weir's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
On his way. It takes some time to load a whole medical team into suits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, we seem to have stumbled across something that I find&#8230;a little troubling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
That's not what I wanted to hear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I think we may have found an Ancient viral lab. Wagner and Johnson must have been exposed here. Now, it'd take weeks to sift through all this data, and there's no way of knowing whether the Ancients were just studying the viruses or actively creating them. Either way, the storm has done quite a number on this place, and I've got&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Dumais stiffens and begins to shake, as if terrified and seeing something.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dumais. Dumais? Dumais!</blockquote>
<p>[She approaches another scientist and starts scraping at his shirt.]
</p>
<blockquote>DUMAIS<br />
It's all over you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dumais! Dumais.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DUMAIS<br />
They're all over you. They're all over you!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dumais! Get her off. Dumais!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls her away. She screams. Nearby Peterson sees a vision of a smoky skeletal creature. He sneaks out of the lab. Dumais falls to the floor and bleeds from her ears and nose. Zelenka confirms she has not pulse.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shouting, into radio)<br />
Tell Beckett to pick up the pace. I've just lost another member of my team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Where's Peterson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Peterson.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR NEAR EAST PIER</b>
</p><p>[Peterson walks briskly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Bates looks at life-signs on a large display.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, okay, I think we have him. He's trying to make his way back. It should be okay. Grodin is locking all the doors in the hallway and killing power to the entire section.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
You need to send someone to stop him.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between McKay and Weir's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's under control, Rodney&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
No, Elizabeth, it's not under control. He knows almost as much about Ancient technology as I do. At the very most, what you're doing will just slow him down.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Peterson uses a knife to jimmy a door control so that the doors slide open. He squeezes through.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The computer monitor shows Peterson moving through a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Where does that hallway lead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Straight here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Peterson works on another door control.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Peterson, this is Elizabeth Weir. Can you hear me? I can't imagine how frightening this whole ordeal must be, but Dr. Beckett has reached the rest of your team and begun to treat them. Now, I think the best thing for you to do is to head back. If Beckett gives you a clean bill of health, we'll make sure you get back to the city as soon as possible.</blockquote>
<p>[Peterson gets the door open.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The screen shows Peterson moving closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you sure he can hear me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Positive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can you do anything to make it harder to get through those doors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
I can try.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and his team, in hazmat suits, examine the personnel. Beckett takes McKay's blood pressure.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, you seem perfectly fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, Dumais seemed fine right up to the point where she wasn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've had them set up a small field station down the corridor. We've already started the autopsies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Any ideas?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
From what we can tell, you're all in good shape so I wouldn't jump to any&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Stop trying to convince me I'm fine, Carson. I think we all know better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I was just trying to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are we done here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes off the pressure cuff.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm going to see what I can get from the database. Let me know what the autopsy shows up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, and tell your pathologists to start with their heads.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay steps away, then appears to see a hallucination for a moment. Zelenka notices. McKay shrugs it off anxiously and goes back to work on his laptop.]

That's not good enough. Someone has to go out there and stop him. Teyla and I are ready.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Peterson obviously isn't thinking straight, and he's endangering the entire population of the city.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What are you going to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, as small as they are, the nanovirus is still effectively just a machine run by a computer. The best way to knock out a computer is with an electromagnetic pulse. Thankfully, that's something we can do.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Personnel shut all the laptops in the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're about through shutting down all the electronic gear we brought from Earth. We're still locked out of the Ancient controls, though. There's no way to power them down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, it's not going to be necessary. The Ancient technology works differently than ours. An EM pulse shouldn't have any long-lasting effect on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
We're ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're all set, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Okay&#8230;here we go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Wait. How are we going to know if it works?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, Sheppard's dialing up the most powerful pulse the generator can manage. It probably won't make it all the way down here, but it should affect most of the central tower. I imagine once it wipes out the virus, the city should return control of it to you and end the lockdown.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It won't make it here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If the pulse works, it'll simply be a matter of walking you down to my lab, sitting you down in front of the EMP, and repeating the process.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[The generator is active and spinning up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

It's working. When I should hit the discharge button?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Okay, there should be a red overload light.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yeah, I see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Wait till it comes on, give it a good ten-count, and then discharge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, incredulous)<br />
A ten-count?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between McKay and Sheppard's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Don't worry. I've probably been around more EMPs than anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

This is going to be&#8212; I'm going to be fine, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, that's a yes. You'll be fine&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The red button lights up. Sheppard counts to ten and pushes the discharge button. After a moment the generator starts spinning down.]

Doubtful. Are you still locked out of the Ancient mainframe?</blockquote>

Twenty-nine minutes.</blockquote>

Okay. Okay. They're everywhere!</blockquote>

Well, maybe we shouldn't have overloaded it so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Look, it's fixable. It's fixable. We just need to use a little trial and error.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Look, even if we get this thing working who's to say the pulse is going to get any bigger? Ford and Zelenka have twenty minutes before their arteries rupture&#8230;Are you sure an EMP will kill this thing?</blockquote>

Yes.</blockquote>

<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

Even if we were able to get the EMP generator back online, the chances are slim that we would ever be able to get it powerful enough.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Can we bring the infected to the generator?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
(into radio)<br />
We can't. The city won't let infected personnel through any of the doors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
The major is right. The only way to create an EMP strong enough to wipe these little guys out is&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
To detonate a nuclear explosion in the atmosphere, yes. I heard the first time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I know it sounds severe, but if the major was able to overload a naquadah generator twenty miles above the city, we'd be perfectly safe from a radiological standpoint, and the ensuing blast would be capable of creating a devastating electromagnetic shock wave. Definitely enough to knock this virus out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
(into radio)<br />
Hopefully without destroying all our own computer equipment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's worth the risk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But you are not the one who decides what is and what is not a military situation. Now, both General O'Neill and Colonel Sumner warned me that you don't respect the proper chain of command.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I honestly don't know. Whoever they were, let's just hope that they're not still around.</blockquote>
