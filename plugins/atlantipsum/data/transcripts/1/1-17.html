</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we knew they were coming. At least now we know when.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It means there's still time, Rodney. There's no reason to panic&#8230;yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where there is time, there's hope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Agreed. So, recommendations?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Other than panic?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Other than panic, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I realize this might not be cool, but we should consider M7G-677.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
As a possible evacuation site?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No, ma'am. I'm suggesting we take their ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Their only means of protection from the Wraith? A planet populated mostly by children?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He raises a valid point. We've already established that the ZPM is nearly depleted, but it could be of some limited use to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You asked for suggestions. It's a matter of survival.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I see. Well, we're not quite there yet, and as long as I'm in charge, we will never be there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I agree, Dr. Weir. If this is to be our end, it is best we face it with both dignity and honor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
To that end, I actually have an idea&#8230;in addition to panic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's hear it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's really a long shot, but I think it's most likely worth the effort. Of course, it'll mostly be my effort, so&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think we can send a message back to Earth through the Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I thought we didn't have enough power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not to send a person, no. We'd never be able to maintain the wormhole long enough&#8230; But I think if we were able to tie together all of our power generating capabilities, we might&#8212;and I emphasize might&#8212;be able to establish a wormhole long enough to send a message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How much time are we talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, approximately 1.3 seconds, give or take.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's not much time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Time enough to say S.O.S.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't be so analog. 1.3 seconds is more than enough time to send a message if it's in the form of a high compression data burst. Now, I helped refine the encoding for the U.S. Air Force a few years back. Colonel Carter should be able to decipher it on the other side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're suggesting this now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because it probably won't work, and there's a very good chance it could overload our naquadah generators in the process.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, then we can't take the risk. No power, we won't have a chance in hell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There are three Wraith hive ships on the way, Major. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Besides, I've spent the last few days working out ways of minimizing the risk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Assuming it's possible, how much information could we send?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everything. I mean, mission reports from all the senior staff, a ton of stuff on Atlantis, things we've learned in Pegasus&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
All that. One second?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
1.3.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You jest, but if I can finesse the compression ratios, you'll be looking for things to add.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Doing it.</blockquote>
<p>[The leave the briefing room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stops Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Elizabeth, you realize that if Stargate Command was able to send help&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know. They would have. But still, we have a responsibility to report what we've learned here, about Atlantis about the Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Exactly. We have to warn Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Even if it's the last thing we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Especially if it's the last thing we do.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka briefs the situation at a large screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They don't seem threatening as dots on a screen, do they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which is why we need to do recon and see what we're up against first hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I've been tracking their progress. The Wraith ships apparently go in and out of hyperspace periodically, either because their hyperspace technology is limited, or&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or they're stopping to feed along the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(indicating on screen)<br />
The point is, the pattern is predictable. I can guess with some certainty that they'll be making stops here, here, and here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Even so, those ships are light years away. How do you expect to reach them by puddle jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We fly to a Stargate on a route that Zelenka thinks they're going to drop out of hyperspace and we watch them pass by.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, I have my moments. Teyla and I were just deciding which planet to go to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(indicating on screen)<br />
I am familiar with the people of this world. Their Stargate is in the open and so accessible by ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you think you can remain undetected by the Wraith as they go by your position?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stealth mode. They won't even know we're there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, go, get what intel you can, and get back before Rodney sends his message. I need the both of you here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Won't even stop at the duty free.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate opens. The Jumper Bay opens, and a Jumper descends into the Gate room.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into comms)<br />
In the off chance you get the idea to take the Wraith ships on yourself, Major, I am hereby ordering you not to.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comms)<br />
Believe me, you don't have to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over comms)<br />
Still&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into comms)<br />
Don't take on an alien armada singlehandedly. Understood.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper goes through the Gate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FIELD ON ORIN'S PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Villagers work in the dirt with wooden tools. A young boy runs up to an older man.]
</p>
<blockquote>ORIN'S SON<br />
Father, Teyla's here!</blockquote>
<p>[They see Teyla and Sheppard walking toward them accompanied by other villagers.]
</p>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
(happily)<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Orin&#8230;it has been many days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
Too many. Look at you. You're so different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Much has changed since my last visit. This is Major John Sheppard. And Orin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pleased to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
The harvest is still months away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, I know. We have not come to trade, but to deliver a warning. We have reason to believe the Wraith may be on their way.</blockquote>
<p>[Orin is alarmed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We don't know that for a fact but we're about to go and find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
Yes. It seems they're awakening everywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You should tell your people to take precautions in case they do come.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
I will, but you know as well as I do, Teyla, that the Wraith will track us down wherever we go. There will be no escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about through the Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
The cullings are taking place on many worlds. None are safe. Even we have taken in refugees.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts his arm around the young boy who called him Father.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If they do come, stay far from the Stargate. Take your family to the far tree line there and wait for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
One family, Major. That is all I ask.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry, Orin, I can't make that promise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It will be the very least we can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If there's time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then we must hurry.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>ORIN<br />
Children, we must prepare.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, we have our city specs, mission reports, and tactical assessments all ready to go. What else?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I've included a ton of data that we've been able to decipher from the Ancient database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Really? That is incredible!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the algorithm I've devised is extraordinarily efficient&#8230; Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It must be in order to fit all that data into 1.3 seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
.3 seconds, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We have a whole extra second to fill?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm, a whole extra one, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Is it enough to include personal messages?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;sure. I mean, several hours of video. Much more if it was strictly audio.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think it'd do wonders for morale. Especially now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I could tell my grandma what I've been up to all this time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, if your grandmother had security clearance, yes, you could. But for now, you can tell her that you're well and that you miss her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is all very charming, but I have work to do. Shouldn't I, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Ford)<br />
Lieutenant&#8230; Maybe you'd like to handle this. Give everybody a few minutes on camera to send a personal message to their loved ones.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'd love to, ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Off you go.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone gets up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Weir)<br />
As soon as Zelenka and I can get Jumper Four's engines tied into the grid, we should be able to do low power dry run.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good. Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You don't want to send a message to anyone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know what? Maybe with all my spare time, I'll just record a message myself&#8230; Hmm? You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good, good.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE ORIN'S PLANET</b>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This wasn't supposed to be a rescue mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Orin was a good friend of my father.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And I agreed to warn him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If someone close to your family, a dear friend, was in danger of being taken by the Wraith, would you have not done the same?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not if it jeopardized the mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So in fighting the Wraith, we are to give up that which makes us different from them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I agreed to stop and pick him up if there was time, but only if there was time. I'd like to be saving everyone in the damn galaxy if we could.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
One man and his children are not every person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I agreed to help if there was time. You can only fight the battles you can win.</blockquote>
<p>[In front of the, a hyperspace window opens, and two Wraith hive ships emerge. They fly over the Jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa.</blockquote>

</p><p>[More cruisers drop out of hyperspace and move slowly toward the planet.]

</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Okay, recording. Plenty of battery. So why am I not seeing anything? Oh&#8230;stupid.</blockquote>
<p>[He removes the lens cap and sits in front of the camera.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Okay. Hi, Grandma, Grandpa. It's me, Aiden, obviously. I'm talking to you from a place far, far from home. I'm good, though. You don't have to worry. Life here is pretty routine.</blockquote>
<p>[He flashes back to various violent occurrences he's witnessed.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'm hoping that I'll be able to get home sometime soon. But, you know, if I'm stuck here a while, I want you to know that I'm good. I'm doing things, I'm seeing things I never thought I'd see.</blockquote>
<p>[He flashes back to Dart attacks and other events.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I wish I could tell you all about it. Who knows? One day, maybe I'll be able to, but I want you both to know&#8230;<br />
(tapping his heart)<br />
that you're right here. Always. All the time.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard is piloting the Jumper down the surface.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry, Teyla. Even flying full out, we're just ahead of the armada. I can't risk putting down for Orin or his family.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll take us out of stealth mode for the pass through. Dial the gate.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla starts to dial the DHD for the planet-side Stargate, which is dead ahead. The Stargate activates early.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hang on. Incoming wormhole.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have heard stories of the Wraith dialing in to prevent their victims from using the Stargate as a means of escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So we're stuck here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Once the ship is rendered invisible again, we will be perfectly safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm worried about getting the intel about the Wraith fleet back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They will keep dialing in through the night at the very least. But if we wait in the location I told Orin and his family to meet us, then&#8212;</blockquote>

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I must warn you, I'm not very good at this sort of thing.</blockquote>

Well, don't worry. The only people to see it is going to be your family.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, and you, and the U.S. military.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, give it a shot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What shall I say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Uh&#8230;"I miss you. I wish you were here."</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I wish who was here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't know. Who do you wish was here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Nobody. I wish I wasn't bloody here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Doc, I've got a lot of people I've got to get to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, uh&#8230;I suppose I could say hello to my mother.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Good. There you go. All right, you ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Okay, go. Hello, Mum. I hope this message finds you well. I trust your petunias are in full bloom by now. Oh, and I do hope you're keeping up with the ointment I gave you. If you've adhered to the regime, the fungus should have cleared up by now.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford looks disgusted.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Dude. Fungus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
On her toenails. I thought you said no one would watch this except my family.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah, but&#8212;but fungus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What, then, shall I talk about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't know. It's your mother. Tell her you love her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, no, I can't do that. I go all emotional.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She's very delicate, my mother. As sweet a soul as you'll ever meet. As pure as the driven snow. If I get upset, then she'll get upset, and I can't have that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It's not like we're live, Doc. I mean, if you don't like what we put on tape the first time, we can always do it again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We can?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh. Well, I suppose I could do that, then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
All right&#8230; Here we go.</blockquote>

<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Not long ago, you would have blithely left him behind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the situation has changed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(tearing up)<br />
Earlier today, Lieutenant Ford suggested we steal from a community of children.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's because they have a ZPM, and we could bring them back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Only to face death in Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, Ford and I are military. We've spent a lot of our lives training how to survive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have spent my life surviving the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Part of that training is knowing who you can save and who you can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And that decision is yours alone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I said that I'd wait for your friend if there was time. Now there's time. What else do you want from me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Too much, I fear.</blockquote>

He died in the defense of others, and his sacrifice may have saved many lives&#8230; &#8230;And her keen curiosity are just some of the qualities that your daughter displayed during her duties as scientist on my team. She and several of her colleagues died suddenly just a few weeks ago. I am not at liberty to reveal the cause of her death, but I can tell you that during her time here, Dr. Dumais was a part of something very profound. She saw and did things she never would have dreamed of before&#8230; You can be proud of your son, knowing that he died bravely, while defending others. I confess, I didn't know him as well as I could have, but I do know he was well liked and very well respected among his peers, and I was told of how often he spoke of his family.
