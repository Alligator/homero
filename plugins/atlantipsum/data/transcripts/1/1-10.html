<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I haven't been to the mainland in awhile. How's everybody settling in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Halling believes the first crops will have a good yield.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They still miss home?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is still talk of returning, even though I've told them the Wraith have scorched Athos bare in revenge for our resistance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe in time, this place will start to begin to feel like home.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla notices something ahead.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you see that?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sees it. A huge cloud formation to the right, on the horizon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That can't be a storm. It stretches across the whole horizon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have never seen something like that from so high.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've seen a lot of things from this altitude, but nothing like that.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Atlantis base, this is Jumper One. We're going to change our heading to investigate a storm.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Major, this is Weir. We didn't copy that. You're breaking up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
I said there's a&#8230; &#8230;and it's headed right&#8230; &#8230;little weather forecasting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Did he just say "weather forecasting?"</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper is flying above the storm, which has a huge, hurricane-like pattern.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do all storms look like this from above?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. This must cover twenty percent of the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is it headed towards the mainland?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tracking right toward the settlement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And after that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(worried)<br />
Straight to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay briefs the team, Zelenka, and Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This planet is basically the same size as Earth. Now, hurricanes on Earth never get as big as this bad boy because once they hit the shore, the brakes get put on. But without as much land mass to slow it down here, it's just gaining momentum.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, both of them are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Both of them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We saw only one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It only looked like one. Now, according to the ancient database, every twenty or thirty years, the sea gets unseasonably warm. Now, that, for reasons too boring to get into, means that hurricanes are much more likely to occur.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, like El Nino the ocean is&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Like I said, too boring to go into.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, basically, if you have a situation where there are a bunch of hurricanes out there, the likelihood of two colliding is greatly increased. That's what's happening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's more like a merger than a collision. They are intersecting and combining their power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And? It's headed right towards us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You just said the Ancients experienced these storms every twenty to thirty years. Atlantis must have some sort of precautions put in place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In the past, the Ancients have been protected by the shield, or submerged deep enough in the water not be affected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay strike those options. What else have we got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Nothing. It is a real threat; the high winds alone will wreak havoc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, guys, I mean, this city's been around for a long time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
A storm surge is inevitable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not to mention the fact that by moving over a land mass just before hitting us, the likelihood of tornadoes and electrical activity is greatly increased.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir wipes her brow in dismay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is Atlantis. I mean, we've got to be able to handle that&#8230;Right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The people who built this city knew they had a force field capable of holding back anything mother nature, or, for that matter, the Wraith could throw at them. Without that protection, Atlantis is remarkably fragile.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Even our conservative calculations project widespread structural damage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Flooding could sink the city entirely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How could something as big as Atlantis just sink?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sure the passengers on the <i>Titanic</i> were asking themselves the same question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, let's not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, what you're saying is if Teyla and I hadn't discovered this, we&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We would be in even bigger trouble. All right, what's the plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
By my calculations, we have just under twelve hours until the storm hits, so, uh&#8230; We plan to have a plan&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
By then.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir is incredulous; everyone else concerned.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Sheppard enter, talking.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We start investigating evacuation plans, both on the mainland, and off-world somewhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know McKay will come up with something. He's just setting himself up to be a hero.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, well, maybe Rodney is, but Dr. Zelenka, he seemed genuinely concerned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, my orders are to come up with a friendly planet that wouldn't mind putting us up for the night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Exactly. Take Ford, see what you can work out.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves; she sits at her desk and sighs, about to open her laptop.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;MAINLAND ON ATLANTIS PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Athosians are working to build tents using primitive tools; there is at least one Atlantis-built tent.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(approaching Teyla, holding a rope and bag of supplies)<br />
I don't really have the right boots for this. I was just meant to come out here and inoculate some wee babies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We need all the hands we can spare before it comes. This storm could not only destroy our crops, our settlement could be washed away. If just a few of us were to remain&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Crops can be replaced and homes rebuilt. People can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Which is why we must do what we can now.</blockquote>
<p>[She throws him a coil of rope.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE TRAVEL</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONFERENCE ROOM ON MANARA</b>
</p><p>[Ford and Sheppard speak to the leader of the Manarians.]
</p>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
The entire population of Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
At most, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Only for a day. Two at most.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
We are happy to trade with you for a share of our crops&#8230; But this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know it's a lot to ask, but&#8230; I'm asking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
What do you offer in return?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess we'd owe you one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
One what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A favor.</blockquote>
<p>[Smeadon looks at one of his men in confusion.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, we're in trouble. If you're our friend, you'll help. If not, tell me now so I can ask somebody else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
But who else would take in so many? I want something of value in return.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, you do, do you? You know, we can go find any uninhabited planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
(slyly)<br />
They're usually uninhabited for good reason, Major and you know that as well as I do, or you would not be here. Still, I'm sure you could find another world to take you in&#8230; You're just so short on time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One day you're going to run across a problem and you're going to need our help. Isn't that right, Lieutenant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, sir. We've got lots of ships and weapons we can&#8230;help with.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts his gun on the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
You're telling me we can either be your friends or&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I much prefer friends. That is of value to me.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One night, two tops. We'll bring our own blankets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
(smugly)<br />
Very well. You may send your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This won't be forgotten. I'll go back and tell everybody the good news. I'll send word once we know more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
I look forward to it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ford leave.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Zelenka, and other scientists work hurriedly on laptops.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, no, no, I've already thought of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
He may be onto something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've already thought of it! It doesn't&#8212; Yes, the naquadah generators could be used to power select sections of the city, but when you subtract the areas that need to be secured just to protect themselves, it doesn't leave much power to shield anything else, and the city breaks apart because of the tidal stresses.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, we could relocate some of them, put them closer together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(loudly sarcastic)<br />
You're right. If only we had a magical tool that could slow down time. I foolishly left mine on Earth. Did you bring yours?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You know&#8230;you're not pleasant when you're like this, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm always like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
My point exactly.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ford enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I've got a green light from Smeadon and the Manarians. I'm not sure how pleased he'll be if we get stuck there, though. That's not going to happen, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course it's not. We can always gate off to another planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Comforting. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Are we sure there's no part of the mainland we could go to?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Everywhere that we have explored is in the path of the storm. My people are evacuating even now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Still, Ford's right. The mainland's the size of North America. You're telling me the entire continent's going to get hit? 'Cause I'd rather not owe Smeadon any favors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If we lose Atlantis, we'll be stuck on the mainland without any access to the Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay will come up with something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I will try, but despite what you all may think, I am not Superman.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Was anyone seriously thinking that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Never.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fine. My point is the storm will affect over seventy percent of the mainland and Atlantis isn't safe either. If you want everyone to live, you gate them off-world.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MANARAN CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Smeadon pulls a device from a drawer. It is a communications device.]
</p>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
(into device)<br />
Relay station two, prepare to receive transmission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VOICE<br />
(over device)<br />
R.S.2 awaiting transmission. Over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SMEADON<br />
I need you to relay a message to Cowen, of the Genii. Tell him we have something to trade.</blockquote>
<p>[He smiles slyly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;MAINLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ford stands outside a Puddle Jumper. Teyla users Athosians into the ship. Another ship sits nearby, also being loaded.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
This could be going faster.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Our people are hunters, Lieutenant. Many returning from great distances. Others do not want to leave the settlement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
They know how serious this is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Even I would have a hard time believing in the strength of this coming storm if I did not see it from space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah, well, do what you can to speed things up.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka work.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
In the Czech Republic, we don't have to deal with hurricanes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We don't get that many in Canada either. Once something called "Hazel."</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Hazel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Forty years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
That's interesting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was once almost struck by lightning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(becoming inspired)<br />
Lightning?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay realizes the same thing and stands.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GATE CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka rush in to speak to Weir. McKay nudges Zelenka aside so he can explain first.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That would&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Power. And what does a mega-storm from hell have lots of?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In the form of?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You want to build a windmill?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Electricity!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Atlantis is designed to withstand substantial lightning strikes. There are lightning rods all over the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All those rods are channeled into four main grounding stations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, in turn, those grounding stations discharge electricity back into the ocean, keeping Atlantis safe from massive electric shocks due to lightning strikes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now, many of the hallways are lined with a superconductive material that allows a safe, low-voltage transfer of power throughout the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah. Which, of course means&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm getting there, I'm getting there. Let's say the grounding stations weren't around. Every time lightning struck the city, those halls would become supercharged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So wait, you want&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If we were able to disable the grounding stations&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Which we think we can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Every time lightning struck the city, Atlantis would experience a momentary massive power surge. Now, that energy&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
If it's channeled correctly, though&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, of course if channeled correctly&#8212; could conceivably be used to charge up the shield generator. Now, the more severe the storm, the more energy is produced and the longer we can keep the shield running.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's an ingenious plan, really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm compelled to agree.</blockquote>
<p>[Before Weir even has a chance to react, they start talking excitedly to each other.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The only downside is we have no way of storing all that energy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, once the storm stops and the lightning stops striking&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, we have no way of charging up the generator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then we're back to square one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So the city would survive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'd give us better than ninety percent&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Seventy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eighty percent chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, so we should still evacuate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, but not just because of Zelemka's pessimism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Zelenka. If the plan works, the city will become highly charged with electricity. Really, the only safe place to be once the lightning begins to strike is in the control room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm. We need to evacuate everyone off-world until the storm passes and execute the plan with the smallest team possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, good. Get on it.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn to leave, still talking.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. To the grounding stations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, I think we should go to the power distribution centers first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, good point, good call. Okay. I tend to get ahead of myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah. Okay, so&#8230;</blockquote>

Commander Kolya&#8230; Chief Cowen needs to see you immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
I'm not to be disturbed while training.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII PRIVATE<br />

</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Still haven't turned up yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm afraid not. They are on a hunting mission. No one has been able to get them word about the evacuation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How many again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Three. Two boys and a young woman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Why don't we just take our jumper and go find them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They are hunting in dense vegetation. Even if we were able to locate them, we would be unable to land.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Jumper Three is loaded and ready to go. Maybe you should just&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just go. I will stay behind and give the hunters more time.</blockquote>

I'll stay with you.</blockquote>

Okay, I get the point. We'll wait.</blockquote>

<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
They're not ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Of course they are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You commissioned me to train a group of men who, on their most treacherous day, guarded this facility or performed some sort of reconnaissance mission. They are not yet a strike force.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
This is the rarest of opportunities. Within the next hour, there will be less than ten people on Atlantis, most of them only scientists. Now, surely you can accomplish our goals and get out before the storm hits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
If all goes well. But we don't train assuming all will go well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You wanted my opinion. I gave it to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
(calm by intent)<br />
And I value that opinion&#8230; But the Atlantians are in possession of materials that are vital to our goal of defeating the Wraith. We need them. I need them. Ready your strike force.</blockquote>

I'm finally at the point where I don't mind the taste of it.</blockquote>

I was raised on this brew. It burned away whatever taste sense I had. So, you think you can teach our farmers a thing or two?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DORAN<br />

Let's hope he doesn't put up much of a fight.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sees the other soldiers on the life-signs detector. He makes his way around the device and then to the wall where he has some cover. He has his rifle raised.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SOLDIER<br />
(over radio)<br />
He's stopped. He's not at the control panel anymore. He's looking around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Hold your fire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Those control panels are pretty fragile. You might not want to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[A Genii soldier grabs McKay on his injured arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard works his way out of sight of the two soldiers. They move forward to find him. He shoots one multiple times. The other pursues him, and he dives over the railing onto the balcony. He shoots the second soldier, killing him. He takes his radio from the soldier's wrist. He sees that the control switch has been hit and is ruined. He speaks into the radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Let me tell you what you did wrong here, Kolya.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay gasps in relief to hear Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
A), you lost two of your men. B), You damaged the switch before I could separate the grounding rods, which I'm sure you're gonna get an earful from McKay for&#8230; and, C), you lost all of what little credibility you had with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Do you have any idea how big a setback that is? I may not even be able to activate the shield. I can't possibly&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[A soldier grabs his arm again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Get off me!</blockquote>
<p><i>[The scene switches between Sheppard and Kolya's locations.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You killed two of my men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I guess we're even.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
I don't like even.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm not finished yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Neither am I. Say goodbye to Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya points his gun at Weir. McKay is stricken, and Weir tries to steel herself.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, shouting in anger)<br />
This city has a self-destruct button. If you hurt her, I'll activate it. Nobody'll get Atlantis!</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Even if it exists, Major, you need at least two senior personnel to activate it&#8230; And I'm about to take one of them out of the equation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio, shouting for a response)<br />
Kolya? Kolya! I'll give you a ship! I'll fly it out of here for you myself! Kolya!</blockquote>
<p>[Darkness falls as the storm approaches.]
