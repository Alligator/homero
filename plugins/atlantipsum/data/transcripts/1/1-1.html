<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies through the air heading towards the city ship of Atlantis.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OUTPOST CHAIR ROOM, SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[An Ancient man and woman exchange wordless, emotional gazes as the jumper approaches the dock. She watches him depart with a wistful gaze, then stares out the window towards the cityscape of Atlantis.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Atlantis lifts off from the ground and flies into space.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, PRESENT DAY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The international research outpost is set up over the the Ancient outpost chair room deep below.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANTARCTIC OUPOST</b>
</p><p>[An elevator containing Dr. Weir lowers into the Ancient outpost. Several personnel are milling around, conducting experiments. Grodin studies an inactive drone weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
(over loudspeaker)<br />
This is Operations. General O'Neill is inbound, 20 minutes out.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir approaches Grodin.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Peter.</blockquote>
<p>[She watches him a moment, then heads toward the chair room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett stands up from the chair, arguing with McKay as Weir arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You see? Nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson, get back here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I could sit in that chair all bloody day long, and nothing will happen. It's a waste of time.<br />
(passing Weir)<br />
Excuse me, Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(arguing to Weir)<br />
He's not even trying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He's the one who discovered the gene this technology responds to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, he said he wished he never had it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(surprised)<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know. Can you believe that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(teasing)<br />
We could always test you a third time, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(unamused)<br />
That's very funny.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We have only found a handful of people who are genetically compatible with the Ancient technology, and despite your heroic efforts to interface ours with theirs, we need every one of them to sit in this chair,including Dr. Beckett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What am I supposed to do? He's afraid of the thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This chair controls the most powerful weapons known to humankind. <i>I'm</i> afraid of the thing. But every time someone sits in it, we learn something new about the Ancients who built this outpost. Dr. Beckett should be proud he's genetically advanced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not more advanced. It is a random characteristic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(shrewdly)<br />
This really bothers you, this whole gene thing, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
Oh, clearly, I am overcome with envy.</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel rushes in.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Ah, just the people I need to see.</blockquote>
<p>[He immediately turns and rushes away. McKay and Weir exchange looks. Daniel doubles back and beckons them.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Come with me.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST LAB</b>
</p><p>[They follow Daniel into another room filled with computer monitors showing gate addresses and paper star charts. Daniel stands by a whiteboard covered with Stargate chevrons.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
We've gotten closer and closer to finding the location of the Lost City, but it turns out we've been looking in the wrong place all along. Now, we thought we had a stargate address&#8212;six symbols representing coordinates in space that determined the location of the planet the Ancients went to after they left Antarctica. Now, recently, we determined a seventh symbol.</blockquote>
<p>[He draws the symbol for Earth.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The point of origin, Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
That's not it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then your address must be incorrect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Not incorrect. Incomplete.</blockquote>
<p>[He draws another symbol on the chart between the sixth symbol and the one for Earth.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(intrigued)<br />
What are you saying, Dr. Jackson?</blockquote>
<p>[Daniel labels the new symbol and Earth's with the numbers 7 and 8.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
It's an eight-symbol address. What we're looking for may be further away than we ever imagined, but it's not out of reach.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(nodding)<br />
Atlantis. I think we can go there.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A helicopter flies across the Antarctic landscape.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HELICOPTER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits at the controls. O'Neill sits next to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Apache, Blackhawk, Cobra, Osprey&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
It's a lot of training for the Antarctic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It was the one continent I never set foot on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
It's one of my least favorite continents.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I kind of like it here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(incredulous)<br />
You like it here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, sir. Be there in about ten minutes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST CHAIR ROOM AREA</b>
</p><p>[McKay herds Beckett back towards the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look, we've been through this. I'm not your man.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Keep moving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm a doctor. A medical doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's nothing to be afraid of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You don't understand. I break things like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(insistent)<br />
This device has survived for millions of years intact. It will survive you. Now, sit down, close your eyes, and concentrate.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sighs in resignation and sits in the chair. After a split second he shrugs, frustrated, and starts to get up.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Again, nothing.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay signals for him to stay seated.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, this time just try to imagine an image of where we are in the solar system.</blockquote>
<p>[Skeptical, Beckett closes his eyes and concentrates.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I think I feel something.<br />
(opening his eyes)<br />
It could be lunch-related.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Shut up. And concentrate.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett grimaces, but complies, closing his eyes again in concentration. The chair lights up and shoves backward. Beckett opens his eyes, mouth agape in surprise.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST OUTER CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[The drone Grodin has been studying suddenly activates, catching Grodin by surprise.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Beckett stare in shock and horror as the drone in the outer room starts flying around the room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST OUTER CHAMBER</b>
</p><p>[People everywhere dive out of the way as the drone ping-pongs out of control throughout the chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>WOMAN<br />
Watch out!</blockquote>
<p>[The drone finds the opening of the elevator shaft and flies up it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What did I do?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANTARCTICA OUTPOST ELEVATOR SHAFT</b>
</p><p>[The cage elevator rising to the surface contains Weir, Daniel, and two women. They see the lit drone streak past them, causing the elevator to tremble.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Get us back down there!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The drone bursts through the outpost roof and starts flying at high speed through the sky.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HELICOPTER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
(over radio) All inbound craft, we have a rogue drone that could seek a target on its own. Land immediately and shut down your engines. This is not a drill. I repeat&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's too late. Hang on.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard barely avoids the drone that streaks around the helicopter twice, locking onto the helicopter as a target.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Break right.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard dodges the drone again by flying higher and to the left.]
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
I said, right!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm getting to that, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST</b>
</p><p>[Daniel immediately runs toward the chair room. Weir pauses a moment, taking in the devastation before running after Daniel.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT ANTARCTIC CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir runs up to Beckett her arms outstretched in bewilderment.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I told you I was the wrong person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It doesn't matter now. Just do something!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(soothingly)<br />
Okay, Carson, concentrate on shutting that weapon down before it hurts someone.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HELICOPTER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard looks through his windows searching for the drone.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can't see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(sharply)<br />
Pull up. Pull up!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The helicopter barely misses a mountain ridge then dives down underneath the erratic path of the drone.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett concentrates while sitting in the chair as everyone watches him anxiously.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HELICOPTER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
What about now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(breathless)<br />
Now's good.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTICA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The helicopter skims over the surface. The drone piles into the snow. The helicopter itself lands on a flat surface.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HELICOPTER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(sharply)<br />
Shut it down!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard complies.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(nervously)<br />
Sir, what the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(holding up his hand)<br />
Wait for it.</blockquote>
<p>[They watch and wait. A few seconds later, the drone bursts out of the snowbank, still at high speed, and heading straight for the helicopter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get out!</blockquote>
<p>[The pair scramble out of the helicopter. Sheppard takes a belly-flop into the snow. The drone powers down and slides to a stop mere inches away from O'Neill.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett opens his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I think I did it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HELICOPTER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and O'Neill warily reenter their helicopter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(breathlessly)<br />
That was different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(resigned)<br />
For me, not so much.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Lieutenant Aiden Ford runs into the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Major Sheppard is reporting the drone appears to have been incapacitated. General O'Neill's helicopter is unharmed, and on its way again. Seven minutes out.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone sighs in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Holy crap.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANTARCTIC OUTPOST, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUPOST</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill and Sheppard exit the elevator. Daniel hurries to greet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Jack!</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(dryly)<br />
Daniel. Warm welcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
It wasn't me. How did you manage to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Keep my ass from getting blown out of the sky? The exceptional flying of Major John Sheppard. He likes it here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(bewildered)<br />
Exceptional? You like it here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(pokes Daniel's chest)<br />
What say we cut to the part where you start talking real fast?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Ah. Weir's in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Hey. Don't touch anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill and Daniel leave Sheppard where he nervously looks around the busy room. Scientists are back at their experiments or still cleaning up the mess left by the drone.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUPOST STAR-CHART ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
I figure the Ancients packed up their entire city and left somewhere between five and ten million years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(humoring him)<br />
In their&#8230;flying city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill shoots Daniel an amused, skeptical look.]
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
"Flying city?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Well, keeping in mind this is the race that built the Stargates. They did everything big.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
So, why did they leave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Why'd they leave? Um, who knows? We know the Ancients on Earth were suffering from a plague. Um, maybe some of them were trying to start over, seeding life in a new galaxy. Maybe that's what Ancients do. The point is, we know where they went.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Pegasus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, it's-it's the name of a dwarf galaxy in the local group.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
After all that time, is there any hope of actually meeting them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
(looks to Weir)<br />
Uh, well, who knows, but isn't that reason enough to go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I've been choosing members for this expedition for months, Doctor. I'm not the one who needs convincing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, I'm convinced. Have fun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Uh, it-it's a little more complicated than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We need the "Zed-PM" to power the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
"Zee-PM". He's, uh, he's Canadian.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(to McKay, half-mockingly)<br />
I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, "Zero-Point Module," General. The Ancient power source you recovered from Praclarush Taonas and that's now powering the outpost's defenses. I've since determined that it generates its enormous power from vacuum energy derived from a self-contained region of subspace time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
That was a waste of a perfectly good explanation. The answer's no.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANTARCTIC OUTPOST, CHAIR ROOM AREA</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard wanders near the chair room, where he hears Beckett bragging to a few scientists who are entranced by his tale.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(chuckling)<br />
The second I shut my eyes, I could see. I just felt this power that I've never had before. I had it dancing all across the sky. It was magical, it really was. I mean, well, they are lucky. I don't know where it came from. I just tried to concentrate, and the drone shut itself down.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sees Beckett speaking to two others next to the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So you were the one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angrily)<br />
You're the one who fired that thing at me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(placating)<br />
Look, we're doing research, working with technology that's light-years beyond us, and we make mistakes. I'm incredibly, incredibly sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(mollified)<br />
Well, next time, just be a little more careful, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's what I said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell was that thing anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You mean the drone?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The weapon the Ancients built to defend this outpost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(worried)<br />
You do have security clearance to be here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, yeah, General O'Neill just gave it to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(gulping in surprise)<br />
Then you don't even know about the Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The what?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUPOST CHAMBER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Jack, you know that gating to another galaxy requires an enormous amount of power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Yes, I do. Find another way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
There's no other way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Do you think there are more of these&#8230;zed things in Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DANIEL<br />
Yes, and who knows what else we could find. This isn't just some other civilization we're talking about. These are the <i>gate builders</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The potential wealth of knowledge and technology&amp;emdash;it outweighs anything we've come across since we stepped through the Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
Well, with the amount of power you'll need to make this trek, odds are it'll be one-way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, we know. But the benefit to humanity is far greater than the risk, General. And it is a risk that every one of my expedition members is willing to take.</blockquote>
<p>[O'Neill considers this.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUPOST CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We think the gene was used as a sort of genetic key, if you will, so that only their kind could operate certain dangerous or powerful technologies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So some people have the same genes as these Ancients?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The specific gene is very rare, but on the whole, they look very much like we do. In fact, they were first. We're the second evolution of this form, the Ancients having explored this galaxy for millions of years before&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[He notices Sheppard is moving to sit in the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Major, please don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sitting)<br />
Come on, what are the odds of me having the same genes as these guys?</blockquote>
<p>[As soon as Sheppard sits down, the chair activates. Sheppard freezes out of nervousness.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(shocked)<br />
Quite slim, actually.<br />
(calling out)<br />
Dr. Weir!<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Don't move.</blockquote>
<p>[He runs out of the room. A few moments later. Weir, McKay, O'Neill and Daniel return with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Who is this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>O'NEILL<br />
(exasperated)<br />
I said don't touch anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(protesting)<br />
I just sat down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Major, think about where we are in the solar system.</blockquote>
<p>[After a moment, a three dimensional holographic image of the solar system appears over their heads. Weir is elated. McKay is shocked.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did I do that?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST SURFACE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT OUTPOST</b>
</p><p>[O'Neill and Weir walk through the facility.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />

This drawing far predates that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, what? Someone knew it was going to happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe it happens&#8230;again and again. The Wraith allow our kind to grow in numbers, and when that number reaches a certain point, they return to&#8230;cull their human herd. Sometimes, a few hundred years will pass before they awaken again. We've visited many, many worlds. I know of none untouched by the Wraith. The last great holocaust was five generations ago, but still, they return in smaller numbers, to remind us of their power.</blockquote>

</p><p>[A panel expands and a drone launches, destroying a Wraith dart. The jumper continues to dodge fire from the other dart ships as it circles back to the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Try and go invisible again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(wincing)<br />
I tried. It must be damaged. Dial the gate.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford starts to dial.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE AND CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Off-world activation!</blockquote>
<p>[Weir runs out of her office.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Raise the shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper continues to dodge Wraith blasts. The Stargate is active, but two darts still guard it. Drones hit one of them as the jumper flies past the Stargate without going through.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Be ready to punch in your code on the next pass.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford fumbles for his G.D.O.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What's the range on these things?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do we have an identification code?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay races to a laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nothing yet.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Drones shoot out the remaining ship guarding the Stargate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ford)<br />
Enter your code!<br />
(to everyone else)<br />
Hang on.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm reading Lieutenant Ford's IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Let them in.</blockquote>
<p>[Grodin lowers the shield.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper loops for another pass, dodging fire.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Some errant blasts come through the Stargate. Expedition guards dive out of the way.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Give them a few more seconds!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper races towards the Spacegate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(worried)<br />
We're going too fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper's drive pods suddenly retract and it coasts through the Stargate, still at high speed. Three small Wraith dart ships follow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The jumper comes to an abrupt halt just after it clears the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Re-activate the shield!</blockquote>
<p>[The shield stops the other ships from passing through. McKay breathes a sigh of relief, and he and Grodin join Weir at the balcony. The jumper floats back up into the bay.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Atlantis. Please remain seated till the Puddle Jumper's come to a full and complete stop.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Halling exchange relieved smiles.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Athosians and expedition members mingle together. Several tables have food. All seem happy. Ford follows Sheppard to a quieter part of the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I guess this is home now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(gesturing to one of the buildings)<br />
I'm thinking of a little place with an ocean view. Out of the way.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir comes up behind them, carrying three mugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Major, Lieutenant, I thought the occasion merited opening this&#8230;compliments of General O'Neill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(raising a toast)<br />
Cheers.</blockquote>
<p>[They all take a drink. Sheppard sets down his mug afterwards, looking pensive.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You did good, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know about that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey, there was no way you could have saved Colonel Sumner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I have to live with it.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir swallows and nods.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm beginning to think you were right. I have made things much worse. I haven't made us many more friends out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No? Look around you.</blockquote>
<p>[They look back at the crowd. Halling can be seen grinning with Jinto and exchanging the forehead touch of affection common to Athosians. They look out at the ocean. Teyla has been close enough to overhear and turns to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I agree, Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[She approaches and puts her hands on his shoulders, leaning forward with a head bow. Hesitantly, Sheppard bows as well, repeating the forehead touch. They lean back.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You have earned both my friendship and that of my people. With our help, you will make many more friends.</blockquote>
<p>[She grins at Weir and walks away. From amongst the crowd, Beckett and McKay watch her go, McKay gnawing on a chicken wing.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(sighing)<br />
How come I never make friends like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You need to get out more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We're in another galaxy. How much more out can you get?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(distracted by his chicken)<br />
Is there lemon in this?</blockquote>
<p>[He walks back towards the buffet table. Weir and Sheppard remain at the outer balcony]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
One more thing, Major, something I'd like you to sleep on. I have a few thoughts on it myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thoughts about what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Who the members of your team might be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
<i>My</i> team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, you are the ranking military officer now, or do you need to be reminded of that? We need to get back out there, do what we came to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You realize that could get us into all sorts of&#8230;trouble, right?</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange wry grins and lean on the banister.]
