<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A Puddle Jumper skims over a pond and trees.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The team look out the view-screen as Sheppard pilots the craft.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Anything look familiar to you, Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. I do not believe this is a world I have visited before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Without landmarks how can you tell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is difficult by air, but every world is unique in its own way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've read a lot of reports from SG teams on missions like this one. Specifically, the mission reports of Colonel Samantha Carter. She and I worked together to avert global catastrophe a few years back. She and I&#8230;ay-yi-yi. Anyways, what was I saying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Mission reports&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right, well, apparently, there's remarkable similarities between worlds that support life. It makes sense, really. For example, the color of the sky is just a product&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The ship shudders.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Turbulence?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It seems to be okay now. I wonder what that was.</blockquote>
<p>[He brings up the HUD on the view-screen. McKay looks at the readings.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm getting seriously conflicted readings. It looks like some sort of powerful energy field about two thousand yards over there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Over where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, 18 degrees from our current heading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You think it's worth checking out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Any significant energy emission generally indicates technological civilization.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So&#8230;you think it's worth checking out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(annoyed)<br />
I'm sorry, yes. Energy field good.</blockquote>
<p>[The ship shakes again/]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's getting worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's enough. I'm getting out of here. 
(noting no response to controls)<br />
We're not gaining any altitude. Controls are unresponsive.</blockquote>
<p>[The HUD flickers out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The drive just went off-line. The pod's retracted. We're going in.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The drive pods retract, and the ship descends into the distance.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper has come to rest after ploughing a trench through sand.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Nice landing, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
He took us too close to the energy field.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whose idea was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, you've made mistakes. I've made mistakes. Let's not get caught in the blame game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, can you fix this ship or not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
None of my diagnostic equipment is working.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The sun is still high in the sky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We can make it back to the Stargate before dark.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If we intend to leave, we should start now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Zelenka and I can return and fix it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, Major, you don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not just the jumper. None of my equipment is working, either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Let's gear up.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They all exit the Jumper, wearing tac vests and holding their weapons at the ready. Ford pulls out a compass.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Check it out, sir. I think my compass has gone wonky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You brought a magnetic compass to another planet in another galaxy? You have absolutely no way of knowing if this planet's magnetic field is&#8212;is&#8230; Wait a second. Let me see that.</blockquote>
<p>[The needle on the compass is spinning wildly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The disturbance is electromagnetic. That probably explains why all our equipmentâ€™s out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which direction is the gate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're the one flying. Shouldn't you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. We should be able to figure this out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(stepping forward)<br />
I believe it is this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's move out.</blockquote>
<p>[They follow Teyla's lead.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at compass)<br />
Hey, can we&#8230;go that way for a bit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, it's just&#8230;Lieutenant Ford's compass is acting weird. It might be onto something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'm glad I brought it along.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How prescient of you.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, the come upon a stone pillar.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling)<br />
Hello, hello. All right. Oh, yeah, definitively this way.</blockquote>
<p>[The walk past the pillar and come to more stone ruins.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We didn't fly over this on the way in, did we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. I was kind of busy with the whole "trying not to get us killed" thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
These ruins are very old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Several hundred years at least, I'd say. Maybe more.</blockquote>
<p>[The whole valley in front of them is scattered with stone ruins including pillars and arches.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So the population here is extinct?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Check this out.</blockquote>
<p>[He shows Sheppard the compass, which is not fluctuating less wildly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, I give up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If the disturbance is man-made, as opposed to naturally occurring, it's probably emanating from within these ruins. Somewhere&#8230;over there.</blockquote>
<p>[He uses the compass to give him a hint.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So if we find it, can we shut it off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's worth a shot. If we can shut down the field, we won't have to walk back to the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was thinking more of saving a perfectly good Puddle Jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, guys, stay here for a second, see if McKay can&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[A bunch of young people, some younger than teenagers, jump out from behind the ruins and point bows and arrows at the team. The people are wearing primitive clothing, and their faces are painted as if for hunting or war. The team raise their weapons.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're kids, Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah, with weapons pointed at us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lower your weapon, Lieutenant. Hey&#8230;kids.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are not here to harm you in any way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's right, what she said. We're just&#8212;-we're friendly. Okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We arrived through the Stargate. We were only trying to return home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't think they understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe they do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why are they still pointing arrows at us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HUNTER KID<br />
You're a full-grown.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HUNTER KID<br />
You need to see the elders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Elders&#8230;sound good. Just lead the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Full-growns?</blockquote>
<p>[The children lead them away while keeping their bows pointed at the team.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[In a wooded area, there are more children and living structures. Some dwellings are up in the trees, raised wooden walkways linking them. Someone lowers a rope ladder and two boys climb up. The children murmur about the visitor. Teyla notices an arrangement of a skeleton and some ruined machinery.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They walk over to the "arrangement". It is a dead Wraith and some parts of a ship, all whitened.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Now, whereâ€™d they get that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It looks like a shrine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You don't think they worship the Wraith, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thatâ€™d be a first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That'd be disturbing.</blockquote>
<p>[One of the kids approaches them.]
</p>
<blockquote>HUNTER KID<br />
Wraith bones.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HUNTER KID<br />
Its death bird fell out of the sky years ago. We keep it here to remind us of how life used to be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
"Used to be"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HUNTER KID<br />
Before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Fell out of the sky"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I picked up on that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You think whatever knocked us down knocked it down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's possible. Now, if that's the case, we need to find it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because anything powerful enough to knock out a Wraith dart is a big deal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, that would be nice to have.</blockquote>
<p>[A kid comes to whisper in the ear of the hunter.]
</p>
<blockquote>HUNTER KID<br />
The elders are ready.</blockquote>
<p>[The approach the rope ladder. Ford climbs up first.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE DWELLING</b>
</p><p>[Some men slightly older than the hunters wait. Sheppard is the last to climb up and arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi. Nice to meet you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Iâ€™m Keras, one of the village elders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm Sheppard, and this is Rodney and Teyla and&#8212; Did you say you're one of the elders?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How old are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Twenty-four.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And that makes you an elder?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
How did you get here, Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We used the Stargate to travel from our world to visit yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You do know of the Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a big, round&#8230;thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
No one has come through the well for nearly&#8230;500 years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, well, here's the thing&#8230;Um, we're a little lost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
And you are all older than twenty-four?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford, how old are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Twenty-five, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I guess so. Is that a problem?</blockquote>
<p>[Keras removes his headdress.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Please&#8230;sit.</blockquote>
<p>[The other man approaches him.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
They are trespassers, Keras. We don't have to explain ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
I apologize.</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures. They all take a seat on pillows on the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
You are familiar with the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we're not friends or anything like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
The Wraith used to farm our planet, as we used to farm livestock and beasts of burden. Only, we were their herd.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah, they seem to do that everywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Our ancestors fought them, but our weapons were not strong enough. Our people tried to hide from them, but they were always found. None died peacefully. None could enter into the eternal rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Eternal rest?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
To die at the hands of the Wraith, to breathe your last breath amongst such&#8230;hatred and evil. There's no way to move peacefully into the next world when that is your fate. My ancestors decided that to beat the Wraith, we must learn to think as they think. We ensured that we would never provide the Wraith with a crop worth picking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
By&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
None of us passes the age of twenty-four.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How do you manage that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
On the eve of our twenty-fifth year, we make the sacrifice both for our people and for our own safe passage into the eternal rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You kill each other?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
No. We take our own lives. And so the Wraith have not returned for nearly five hundred years.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE DWELLING</b>
</p><p>[The team is meeting separately from the inhabitants.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Never in my life have I ever felt so&#8230;old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is without a doubt the most screwed-up way of life I can imagine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They seem to accept it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're kids. What the hell do they know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Kids that don't want to keep us around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Because they believe our presence may bring back the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
They can't be right, can they? Would the Wraith just ignore them because they're all young? I mean, I don't eat veal, but it can't be the same thing, can it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course it's not the same. Veal is delicious. The Wraith don't come by anymore, because when their darts fly close to the villages, the electromagnetic field takes them out, much like what happened to our Puddle Jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why do they not just land outside the disturbance and take the village by foot?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry, perhaps I'm not being clear. Nothing works here, not their stunners, their darts&#8230;even their shields wouldn't function correctly. I mean, why would they risk their advantage when there's a smorgasbord through some other stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Our guns still work, though, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because they're relatively primitive. They don't generate an EM field.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We must tell them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not before I've had a chance to look at those ruins, we don't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(angry)<br />
They're sacrificing themselves for no reason.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are we going to tell them, Teyla? "Listen, kiddies, everything you believe to be true is wrong, "and trust us, because we've been here for almost an hour."</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
We've talked it over. You can stay until you've fixed your ship, but you must work quickly. You being here makes our people&#8230;uncomfortable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's fair enough. We'll work as quickly as we can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There may have been something in the ruins where you picked us up that&#8230;caused us to lose control of our ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
They should be watched at all times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Aries&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, that's&#8230;fine. Totally understandable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
I'll choose two of the villagers to keep an eye on you.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ford and McKay walk back to the ruins. Two children follow alongside McKay, talking to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>CLEO<br />
Casta says you're a hundred years old? Are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who's Casta?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CASTA<br />
Me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are you getting your information, Casta?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CASTA<br />
Why are we going to the old city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've got to check something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CASTA<br />
What kind of thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's grown-up stuff.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLEO<br />
What's a grown-up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Someone who's older than you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CASTA<br />
I'm three days older than Cleo. You can tell me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Nice try, but you're not a grown-up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLEO<br />
But you just said someone that's older than me is a grown-up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't need you to tell me what I just said, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLEO<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CASTA<br />
So, why are we going to the old city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ford, a little help here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(laughing)<br />
What are you talking about? You're a natural.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let's see how long we can be quiet. Who could be quiet the longest, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLEO<br />
Well, I'm not a quiet person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's not quiet, that's talking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CLEO<br />
Well, I'm not a quiet person. I talk a lot.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Keras shows Sheppard around.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Do you have young?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Me? No&#8230;not yet, anyway. Do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Oh, yes. They're raised in one of our other villages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Other villages?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
To keep family lines apart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Got it. How many villages are there like this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Twelve. There are a few larger than this one, but more are small in number.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And they all make the sacrifice?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Yes. We all do, as have the many before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No one ever&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, decides not to go through with it, takes off, runs away?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
There has been hesitation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I bet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
We can be&#8230;persuasive when the time comes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know what that means. Look&#8230;I've got to tell you. I&#8212;I don't understand this at all. Where I come from, we value life more than&#8230;well, almost anything else. Lieutenant Ford, he's just a year older than you. Do you know what he would have missed out on if his life was over a year ago?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
You know, we're not all that different. It's just that&#8230;I would rather have twenty-four years of peace than a life of fear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but what if there's another way? Naturally, when the time comes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
The time comes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, of course it does. That's part of being alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
I mean, for me. Tomorrow is the first day of my twenty-fifth year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tomorrow?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Yes. Thatâ€™s why I lead the council of elders. I am oldest among the twenty-fours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean tomorrow, you&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Tonight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(surprised but not disagreeing openly)<br />
Tonight?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Our way was put in place long ago, and it works. It's not for me to question it. Tonight, I die.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Elsewhere in the village, near a pond, Aries speaks to a young woman.]
</p>
<blockquote>PELIAS<br />
How many?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
Four. They claim they're alone, but we can't be sure. There may be more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PELIAS<br />
And you've given them time to repair the ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
Against my strong objection, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PELIAS<br />
So this is Keras.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
Who should be readying himself for his sacrifice, not troubling with the full-growns. I will be the eldest by tomorrow but that may be too late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PELIAS<br />
What do you want to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
They came through the Wraith well, Pelias. If they stay any longer, the Wraith will come back, and all our sacrifices will be for nothing. This calls for action. They must be forced to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PELIAS<br />
I need time to talk to the other villages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
We have little of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PELIAS<br />
You know the laws, Aries. It's bad enough we're leaving Keras out of this. A forced sacrifice must be agreed upon by all the villages.</blockquote>
<p>[Other villagers are watching them argue.]
</p>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
(to others)<br />
Leave us!<br />

I need to get this device turned on, and I am so close to figuring it out, so just give me one more shot. Look, both of you, go to your rooms! You're not buying this, are you?</blockquote>
<p>[They hear the probe outside. Neleus and the other hunter go outside the enclosure to see it. McKay gestures to Cleo and Casta.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, psst! Come on, come on.</blockquote>
<p>[They come inside the ZPM area with him. McKay looks up and sees the probe.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CLEARING NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The stand-off continues.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sir, I don't like where this is headed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Easy, Ford&#8230; Nobody's shooting just yet&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And nobody's going to, either.<br />
(circling slowly, his gun raised)<br />
Aries&#8230;you have no idea what you're up against here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The weapons we carry are more powerful than any you have ever seen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's telling the truth. They do more than make a lot of noise. They will kill you.</blockquote>
<p>[Aries is not convinced.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;RUINS ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Neleus and the other hunter try to shoot down the probe with their arrows while McKay continues to try to get the ZPM to activate. He pushes a series of buttons, and it lights up. The probe drops to the ground, inert. The hunters come into the enclosure.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa.</blockquote>
<p>[The ZPM drops into the device, now fully activated.]
</p>
<blockquote>NELEUS<br />
It works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course it works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NELEUS<br />
I must tell Aries. Come with us.</blockquote>
<p>[The hunters leave. McKay leans down to speak to the children.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, you guys okay? All right, head back to the woods. You're gonna be fine.</blockquote>
<p>[He shoos them out, then sighs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CLEARING NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
Your presence has brought the Wraith. All our ancestors' sacrifices, you've undone, all because you refused to leave when you were told to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not that simple.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
Yeah, it is that simple.</blockquote>
<p>[He nods to one of his mean, who has a crossbow.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Aries, no.</blockquote>
<p>[Keras steps in front of Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Keras!</blockquote>
<p>[Keras is hit in the right shoulder with the arrow from the crossbow.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sir?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard lowers Keras to the ground, Teyla assisting.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hold your fire!<br />
(to Aries)<br />
Look what you've done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
He's as guilty as you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Ready, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angrily)<br />
We will defend ourselves, and believe me, you don't want that!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
Archers, ready!</blockquote>
<blockquote>NELEUS<br />
(running into the area)<br />
It works! Aries! It works! The device works! The device they speak of is real. I've seen it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NELEUS<br />
McKay fixed it, and the Wraith bird fell right out of the sky.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ARIES<br />
That doesn't matter&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>NELEUS<br />
Aries&#8230;it works.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay comes running up the trail.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you all right, McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panting)<br />
Tryin' to catch my breath&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
Get the medical kit from the jumper.<br />
(to Keras)<br />
You're going to be okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives Aries a solemn, grim look.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CLEARING NEAR PUDDLE JUMPER, DUSK</b>
</p><p>[Later, Keras is standing near a small campfire with a sling on his arm. The young hunters and Teyla are gathered around. McKay, Sheppard and the two small children arrive from the ruins.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've been able to boost the coverage by over 50% without much of a power increase, so that should be enough for a sizable population growth.</blockquote>
<p>[Cleo keeps pulling at his sleeve, and he does his best to ignore her by brushing her hand away.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
Thank you, but you have no idea how long the shield will last?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no way of knowing, no but there's a good chance you'll be a grandparent before it&#8230;before it goes.</blockquote>
<p>[Keras smiles at McKay and his antics with the children.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'd be happy to come back and check in on you every now and then. In fact, Ford would be happy to come back and explain how to be a 25-year-old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
I'll look forward to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You'll have to get used to a few things now that everything's changing around here, but we can talk about that next time we visit. Just promise me you'll stick around.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
I will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Have all the villages agreed to suspend the sacrifices?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
They will require us to change some laws, but for now, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(coming out of back of Puddle Jumper)<br />
Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, right. Here.</blockquote>
<p>[He tosses a bag of something to Keras.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
What's this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, where we're from, you get presents when you turn a year older.</blockquote>
<p>[It's a bag of chocolate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to children)<br />
See him there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Happy birthday.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There you go.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay follows the rest of the team into the Jumper. He waves vaguely at the kids.]
</p>
<blockquote>KERAS<br />
(handing out chocolate)<br />
Here you go. One for you.</blockquote>
