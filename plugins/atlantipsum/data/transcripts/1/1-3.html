<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay watches some lab mice in their cage. Beckett is nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Have you got your eye on anyone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hmm&#8230;not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, I was talking to the mouse, but now you mention it, some of those Athosian women are pretty hot, and we did just save them from the Wraith, so we've got to trade on that while you can, you know, before they discover we're not actually that cool.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(patting a bed)<br />
Sit down. I'm ready.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay runs over and leaps onto the bed, rolling up the sleeve on his left arm. Beckett rolls up his right arm instead and preps it for an injection.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm surprised you're so eager to volunteer for this, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you know me, always eager to help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(dubious)<br />
Right. So do you have any questions about the process? I mean, you are a scientist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry, medicine is about as much of a science as is, oh, I don't know, voodoo. All I need to know is that will enable me to use Ancient technology like Major Sheppard, or yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett taps McKay's arm to get a vein, probably somewhat harder than necessary as he glares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, hopefully. You are the first human trial.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, why now? I mean, if it's possible, we knew we'd need as many people with the gene as we could get.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, actually, without proper FDA approval, it was virtually impossible on Earth&#8230;let's just say it's, uh, legal here in the Pegasus Galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(worried)<br />
And completely safe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
As far as experimental gene therapy goes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay does not look comforted.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I am manipulating your DNA. Here we go.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett readies the syringe, but McKay pulls back his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe you should tell me more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We believe A.T.A., or Ancient Technology Activation, is caused by a single gene that's always on, instructing various cells in the body to produce a series of proteins and enzymes that interact with the skin, the nervous system, and the brain. In this case, we're using a mouse retrovirus to deliver the missing gene to your cells.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(higher pitched)<br />
A mouse retrovirus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's been deactivated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(still worried)<br />
Are there any side&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett injects McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
&#8230;effects?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Dry mouth, headache, the irresistible urge to run on a small wheel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pained)<br />
Oh, that's very amusing. So how long until it starts working?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ah, it could take some time. What is that?</blockquote>
<p>[He notices a small oval object McKay has in his left hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, something I found in one of the research labs, something the, uh, Ancients were experimenting with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Do you know what it is?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay strokes the device and shoots Beckett an excited grin.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh&#8230;pretty sure.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Expedition members move boxes. Weir and Grodin walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
It's desalinizing the seawater and storing it in tanks big enough to supply the whole city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good, so fresh water won't be a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
It seems some Ancient technology requires the user to have the gene. Other things merely require initialization. Once activated, like the control room, anyone can push the buttons to make them work.</blockquote>
<p>[They are almost run down by Jinto and two other Athosian boys coming down the stairs they are ascending.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
Good morning, Doctor Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(bemused)<br />
Morning. Careful!<br />
(to Grodin)<br />
I think we need to designate some recreational areas&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And we certainly need to clear the hallways and get everything put away as soon as possible, and can we lose the ten-thousand-year-old dead plants?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Of course. We're still in the process of making sure everyone's been assigned living quarters. Major Sheppard seems to be taking his time okaying enough space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, the safety and security of this expedition are his&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(heard from distance)<br />
Okay, I'm ready.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Grodin turn to see Sheppard push McKay off the balcony across from them, down into the Gate Room below.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh, my God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(pleased)<br />
Did you see that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes! What the&#8230;?</blockquote>
<p>[They look down to see McKay leaping to his feet, completely unharmed. The object he was holding in the infirmary is now glowing green and attached to his chest, over his t-shirt.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm fine.</blockquote>
<p>[He and Sheppard exchange wide grins. Sheppard, Weir, and Grodin hurry down the steps to meet him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, Beckett's gene therapy worked. I was able to activate this. It's a, uh, personal shield, acts like a, uh, protective skin, and it must have inertial dampening properties, too, because I didn't feel a thing. Watch this.<br />
(to Grodin)<br />
Hit me.</blockquote>
<p>[Grodin tries to punch McKay in the face. A few inches away, his fist strikes a green energy field, knocking him back.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Ow! God.</blockquote>
<p>[Jinto and his friends laugh while Grodin nurses his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You didn't have to swing so hard. And notice that he didn't even hesitate!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm still trying to understand how you thought it was a good idea to test this device by having someone throw you off a balcony.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, believe me, that's not the first thing we tried.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I shot him.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir tilts her head expectantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shrugging)<br />
In the leg.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(elated)<br />
I'm invulnerable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Aren't you the one who's always spouting off about how proper and careful scientific procedure must be adhered to?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay bounces on the balls of his feet, his good mood not hampered by Weir's lecture.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(in sing-song)<br />
In-vulner-able.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, take it off. Let's go have this meeting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(muttering)<br />
You're just jealous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(dryly)<br />
Oh, yes, green with envy.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to take it off, but the shield stops his hand from being able to touch it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This could be a problem. I can't get at it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard tries, but he too is repelled. McKay looks at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just checking.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett wraps Grodin's injured hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
I'm thinking "Mr. Invincible."</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
"Captain Untouchable."</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Ooh, that's good.</blockquote>
<p>[They laugh. McKay scowls at them from nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you guys done?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've been working on this gene therapy for months. Forgive me for wanting to celebrate the fact that it worked on the first human trial.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rolls his eyes and waves his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
Oh, let's all have a toast.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett's and Grodin's expressions change from amused to concerned as they both turn to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Just a thought here, but have you tried eating or drinking anything since you put that on?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks horrified. He pours a cup of coffee and tries to drink it. It spills down the shield before getting anywhere near his mouth. He pours the rest down himself.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
This may be more serious than I suspected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, thank you. I'm hungry already. What am I going to do? If I don't get this stupid thing off, I'll be dead by the end of the day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Relax, you can live three or four days without water.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I'm talking about food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, you found some Ancient text with the device. What did it say about taking it off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yeah, there were some explicit instructions, which I chose to completely ignore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Well, some Ancient technology uses a mental component for operation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just shut up. I'm thinking.</blockquote>
<p>[He closes his eyes in concentration and stands quietly for several moments.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Is there any chance that the gene therapy isn't permanent?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm a dead man.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stands before a schematic of the Atlantis city-ship. Weir, Ford, and Teyla are there.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We can probably maintain security in this area with the limited number of personnel we have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My people can help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you, Teyla. For the time being, we'll find other ways that the Athosians can contribute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You do not trust us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not that, it's just that we&#8230;we need to train your people in our weapons and tactics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You invited me to be a member of your team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And we value your knowledge and expertise.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters, looking despondent.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
As we value all the Athosians. For now, there should be more than enough living space for everyone within the designated area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We have always lived in the shadow of the Wraith, but my people have never been in a place such as this. They are afraid. Some believe the ghosts of the Ancestors remain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't think that's the case, but-but still, we're going to need a bit more time in order to explore the entire city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're very cautious intergalactic explorers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And we don't want anyone else getting hurt the way Halling did. I mean, everyone needs to understand they are not to touch anything unfamiliar unless it's been cleared first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's very important. I mean you never know. Even a tiny, little, innocuous-looking thing can&#8230;can kill you.</blockquote>
<p>[They look at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(raising his hand)<br />
Dead man talking.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett works on some lab equipment. Weir enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Doctor Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So Grodin's got a team going through the Ancient research material that accompanied the shield device, but McKay's been through it, and he didn't find anything helpful, and he is "the smartest guy here".</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
So he likes to tell us. Listen, I feel terrible. It's possible this was a result of artificially imposing the gene.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I have another theory. We know that there is a mental component to using Ancient technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You don't have to remind me. I experienced it firsthand with that drone weapon back on Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Exactly, so don't you think it stands to reason that McKay should be able to shut this thing off with his mind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Are you suggesting he doesn't want to shut it off?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We may be settling in here, but this place &#8212; it's still pretty intimidating. I mean, a giant abandoned city full of things way beyond our level of understanding, impending threat of attack from the Wraith&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No question, it gets bloody creepy here at night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So I'm not saying it's conscious, but perhaps subconsciously&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[She shrugs.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't think he wants to die of dehydration.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, neither do I, but he's not there yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You think when it comes down to it, the shield will just shut itself down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The Ancients were smart enough to build fail-safes into their other technology. I mean, this entire city, it rose from the deep of the ocean when danger was imminent. Why would they design a personal shield that could kill you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I certainly hope you're right, for Rodney's sake.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Senior staff stand around Grodin's station as he demonstrates inputting a password. Teyla is not present.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
The self-destruct system requires two separate codes. Now, each code is unique, and everyone here will be required to memorize their code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, don't bother giving me one.</blockquote>
<p>[Grodin gives McKay a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
As far as we know, this is the only Stargate in the Pegasus Galaxy which is capable of dialing Earth&#8230; which would make it the last line of defense against the Wraith. If they're going to attack, which we must consider a very real threat, we simply cannot let them gain control of this complex.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
If both codes are properly entered, the naquadah generator will overload. It will take thirty seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You're sure it will do enough damage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ever seen a twenty kiloton nuclear explosion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I have.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone stares at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(dismissively)<br />
Not up close. Look, I think we should tell Teyla what's going on here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
At this moment, we still don't know if it was one of the Athosians who tipped off your arrival to their planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I trust Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So do I, but Teyla trusts her people. If we tell her, she'll want to tell them, and I need more time to get to know them.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HALLING'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sits on a carpeted bench surrounded by several Athosian children. He is telling them a story in a room lit only by candlelight. Halling stands nearby, leaning on crutches.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(speaking low and slow)<br />
Well, they thought he was finally dead but when they turned their backs to go&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard suddenly flicks on his flashlight underneath his chin to look spooky.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(speaking loud and quickly)<br />
His cold dead eyes opened beneath his hockey mask and he rose up with his giant bloody knife&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard suddenly stands and uses his flashlight as a prop for the knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
What's a hockey mask?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at the children blankly, who are looking equally blank back at him. The kids are not scared at all.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hockey's a game. The guys skate around on the ice and try to put a puck into the net?</blockquote>
<p>[Still no reaction.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The goalies wear masks. It's really&#8230; scary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
Tell us more of this game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEX<br />
Can we play it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sitting)<br />
Actually I don't really see the attraction. Now, football&#8230;football's a real man's sport, but we'll save that for another time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Yes, it's time for bed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATHOSIAN CHILDREN<br />
(disappointed)<br />
Awww.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now, remember, tomorrow night, kids, another tale called "Nightmare on Elm Street."</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
All right, children, let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[She herds them out of the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Thank you, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hope I didn't scare them too much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
(dryly)<br />
I don't think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla leads the last of the children back to their parents.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(to child)<br />
Good night. Good night.</blockquote>
<p>[She waves farewell. Sheppard approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, listen, Teyla. Don't tell McKay what I said about the hockey not being a real man's sport, because, uh, it's a Canadian thing. They're a little touchy about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am interested in hearing more about this, um, "football" you say you love so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can do one better. Come here.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads her away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HALLING'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Jinto lies on his side one bed. Halling is stretched out on the next bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
Father, do you think we are safe here from the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
(sighing)<br />
I think there's nothing certain in life&#8230;except my love for you.</blockquote>
<p>[Jinto smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
Do you miss the wind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Yes, but if you're very quiet, you can hear the ocean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
Do you think the ghosts of the Ancestors still live here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Jinto! Go to sleep.</blockquote>
<p>[Jinto sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS RECREATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard passes a bowl of popcorn to McKay. Ford, McKay, Sheppard, and Teyla are watching a football game on a monitor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Funny.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard eats some popcorn himself and sits up as a certain play is set up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, here it comes. Watch this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ANNOUNCER<br />
Flutie is back. Fours seconds, three seconds, two seconds, one&#8230; Flutie throws. This game is over. Hail Mary, it is caught!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh! That is beautiful. Can you believe that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(befuddled)<br />
Should I not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the defense didn't cover the receiver because he didn't think the quarterback could throw that far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They seem very happy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, they just won one of the best games of all times against all odds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Flutie won the Heisman that year. And then went on to play in Canada.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He played hockey, too?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford snickers as McKay stares stone-faced at Teyla. Weir enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey, what are you guys doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm teaching Teyla how football is the corner stone of western civilization.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(with mock petulance)<br />
And you didn't invite me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What, you like football?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(smiling in confession)<br />
No, not really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, come on. It-it's real, it's unpredictable, it's full of passion and&#8230;beer, hot dogs&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Cheerleaders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I just can't understand. You're allowed one personal item, and you chose this.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir snatches some popcorn.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a metaphor. Don't you see? This entire expedition is the biggest Hail Mary in human history.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is a Hail Mary?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford and McKay look amused as Sheppard scrambles.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a play that you just saw. It's named after a prayer. See, there's this woman, and her name is Mary, and she&#8230;uh&#8230; Did I mention how much I like Ferris wheels?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR NEAR QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Jinto sneaks out of his room and stands by another door.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
Psst.</blockquote>
<p>[The door immediately opens and Wex comes out holding the Wraith mask they played with on Athos. He hands it to Jinto.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEX<br />
Your turn to be the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
You can be the Wraith. I get to be Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEX<br />
Oh!</blockquote>
<p>[Wex sighs that he didn't think of it first as Jinto grabs a wooden stick and hides his eyes.]

How smart is this thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know, but this is much simpler than I thought. It's kind of like a mousetrap. This button here causes the device to emit an energy signature that attracts the creature. This one shuts it in. Now, the only downside is it looks like, uh, someone's actually going to have to be here to press the buttons.</blockquote>
<p>[As he speaks, he indicates the appropriate controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sighing)<br />
I'll do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to leave. Weir frowns.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Wait a minute, Rodney. You're still wearing the shield. Isn't there a chance that if something went wrong, that would protect you?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks stunned. The shield powers down and falls off his chest into his hand. They all stare at each other a moment, then McKay rummages in his pocket for his unopened power bar, taking a big bite.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleased)<br />
Hmm!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I had a feeling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean? Had a feeling about what? You think I wanted it to come off just now? You think I'm scared? I'm not scared. I'll stay. I'll do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sarcastic)<br />
No, that's okay. You might faint again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It&#8212;it's just not working anymore.</blockquote>
<p>[He tries to press it to Sheppard's chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look&#8230;see, it doesn't work on you either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look, I just meant that it wasn't going to let you die.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(frustrated)<br />
Well, it is just a coincidence that it happened to stop working now. God, I need a drink.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves as Sheppard and Weir exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HALLING'S CHAMBERS</b>
</p><p>[Halling sits at Jinto's bedside. Jinto frowns.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
You always told me I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Well, I was wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
I can't sleep now. What if the darkness comes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It won't.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stands by the open doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
How do you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Because&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla uses her lighter to ignite a candle from across the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's afraid of fire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>JINTO<br />
The darkness is afraid?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sits on Jinto's bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Everything is afraid of something.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The entity, getting larger, moves through the corridors.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, ATHOSIAN QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Weir walks through the area, smiling in acknowledgment to the Athosians. Candles are lit everywhere as they comfort each other in their fear.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Grodin approaches to Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
So the shield device just came off by itself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, it just stopped working. He even tried it on Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
It wouldn't work on Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
McKay didn't tell you? The text we studied said the shield imprints on the wearer. If we're right, it wouldn't work on anyone else.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters, carrying a large flood flashlight and eating a wrap of some sort. Weir stares at him as Grodin takes his seat.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are we ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
You do realize that when we shut everything down, we're going to lose the sensors. We're not going to be able to track it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We have security personnel posted around the living quarters. At least we have some warning.</blockquote>
<p>[She lights a candle.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla told the Athosian children that lighting a candle will help protect them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And you're doing it because?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's going to get dark in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p>[He lights his floodlight and mutters smugly.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Okay, Major, go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard activates the containment vessel.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Grodin)<br />
Now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Shutting down power.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[All the power goes off except for the containment vessel. Sheppard turns on the light on his rifle. He sees the shadowy entity coming his way.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's coming.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They nervously exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p><i>[The conversation switches between the lab and control room.]</i>
</p><p>[Sheppard gets a look at how large the entity is.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Size doesn't matter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
That's a myth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
It'll fit. The device traps the creature in subspace. You just need to make sure it gets all the way inside the containment vessel.</blockquote>
<p>[The entity comes closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, come on.</blockquote>
<p>[The entity approaches the vessel, studying it and Sheppard. It then moves away rapidly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Son of a bitch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Damn thing took one look and went away. It's a lot smarter than we thought.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla stares down at the Stargate as Grodin, McKay, Sheppard, and Weir are around a console.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We need to know where it is right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
We'll have to turn the power on to use the sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do it, but just the operations tower.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's headed this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because you turned the power back on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We can't go on like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you think it wants to be here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's been trapped here for thousands of years, alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's not alone anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It doesn't think on that level. It thinks about eating. That's it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You would know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If we stay, it will kill us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not unless we can kill it first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I don't see how.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then either we must go, or it must. Maybe it wants to go. If we open the Stargate&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay set up a naquadah generator on a MALP.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is a bad idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You said that already.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's worth saying again.</blockquote>
<p>[From the control room, Teyla and Grodin see the entity's movements heading towards the Gate Room. She runs to the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It's coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
An open Stargate is a huge power source. This thing is smart. It knew enough not to get trapped in the Ancient containment vessel again. What makes you think it's going to follow a naquadah generator into the wormhole?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you got a better idea?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay closes the lid on the container holding the generator.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[He runs up the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you okay?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods tensely.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everyone but Sheppard is now upstairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
It's almost here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do you have an address?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
M4X-337, a barren wasteland.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Dial it.<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
That was good thinking.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods.]
</p><p>[The entity now enters the Gate Room. Sheppard sees it approach, then hits the activation for the MALP, sending it on its way as he runs away. The entity swarms around it in a black smoke, filling the Gate Room. The MALP cannot be seen.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not goin' anywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I can't see if the MALP got through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
The entity could have drained the battery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(angry)<br />
It could be feeding off the generator, off the Stargate. I mean, t
his is a disaster.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Shut it down.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to shut down the gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
The consoles are dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There must be something we can do.</blockquote>
<p>[Unnoticed by the others, McKay takes out the shield from his pocket, staring at it.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
We don't know if the MALP is still down there. It's possible that the entity will still go through the gate once it's depleted the energy in the naquadah generator on the MALP.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Or it could just continue to feed off the gate's energy.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay places the shield back on himself. Everyone else is staring at the entity. McKay steps to the top of the staircase. Sheppard suddenly notices he's on the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<p>[He runs toward McKay but is too late to stop him. Weir spots McKay heading down the staircase, the green shield reacting as the entity tries to swarm him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<p>[Inside the entity, McKay sees particles of electricity reacting to each other. He spots the MALP a few feet from the Stargate. He picks up the container holding the generator and hurls it through the open wormhole. The entity follows.]
</p><p>[As the last of the entity's smoke disappears through the wormhole, the Stargate deactivates. McKay lies supine, unconscious in the middle of the 'gate room. Everyone runs downstairs. Sheppard kneels beside him and touches his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[She touches his chest, and the shield falls into her hand, completely dead.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
The power must have been drained by the entity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Medical team to the gate room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(touching him)<br />
He's not burned. He's breathing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[He stirs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
McKay. Hey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You did it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I did?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It went through the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You must have passed out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, thanks for not saying the other thing.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone smiles, relieved. Sheppard stands again.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
<i>That</i> was a Hail Mary.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Grodin help McKay sit up. He groans, then notices the medics finally arriving.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(caustic, but weak)<br />
Thank you. Take your time. Man down.</blockquote>
