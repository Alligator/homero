<p>When the Atlantis team is ambushed by the Wraith on an off-world trip, Dr. Weir begins to suspect that one of the Athosians is actually a Wraith spy. Despite the disapproval of Teyla and Sheppard, she confines the Athosians to the south side of Atlantis and interviews them. But when the interviews take on an accusatory tone, growing tensions cause a mass exodus of Athosians from the city.<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_1.05_%22Suspicion%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 1.05 &quot;Suspicion&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

</p><p>[Scenes from SGA 1.01 "The Rising Part 1" and SGA 1.02 "The Rising Part 2‚Äù are shown.]
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL AND GATE ROOM </b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activated with an incoming wormhole. SFs take defensive positions around the Stargate. Weir exits her office and heads to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
It's Major Sheppard's IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They've only been gone a few hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Atlantis, this is Sheppard. We're coming in hot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Lower the shield.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir moves to the balcony to watch. The shield lowers. Stunner weapons blasts strafe the room, making the guards dive for cover. Sheppard's team runs through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Raise the shield.</blockquote>
<p>[Just before the shield activates, one of the blasts strikes McKay in the face, knocking him prone.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Medical team to the gate room.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ford roll McKay over; Teyla holds his head. He's unconscious. Sheppard feels for a pulse.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I got a pulse.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay comes to, but looks groggy. He moves his eyes, but not his head. One side of his mouth is drooped, and he's slightly drooling. Sheppard and Beckett are at his bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voice slurred)<br />
I can't feel anything, but&#8230;I can't talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can't talk, either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(voice slurred)<br />
That's what I'm trying to say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Your body experienced a full overload to its sensory and motor nervous system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You took one of those Wraith stunners right in the face.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's really quite fascinating, actually. The Wraith weapon impedes the firing of neurons that enable the necessary&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm paralyzed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(loudly)<br />
The paralysis is only temporary. Don't worry, Rodney. You'll be up and about in no time.<br />
(to Sheppard, more quietly)<br />
Bloody good thing the Wraith weapons are only designed to incapacitate, or he'd be dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicked, but still slurred)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir enters and calls from the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Major? Could I see you for a second?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. Beckett has already moved on to another patient.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(slurred)<br />
Hello? Hello?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard walks with Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's going to be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I've heard. I want to know what happened out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The same old thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Which makes it the fifth time your team's encountered the Wraith&#8230;out of how many missions?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(thinking)<br />
Nine&#8230; So probably not a coincidence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think it's pretty damn obvious now. We've got a spy in Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>Sheppard, McKay and Ford are sitting in the conference room. McKay puts his right foot on the table and starts massaging his stockinged foot. Sheppard looks at him askance.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Could you please not do that here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
My foot is still numb, if you'll excuse me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
At least your mouth still works fine.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Bates enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Bates)<br />
Oh, good.<br />
(to everyone)<br />
All right, let's get started.</blockquote>
<p>[The doors seal closed as she and Bates take their seats.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(looking around)<br />
Shouldn't we wait for Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla wasn't invited.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's a member of my team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
She's also an Athosian, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
If we've been compromised, and every indication suggests that we have, it's almost certain that one of them is responsible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're talking about Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't like it either, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(talking over her)<br />
Good, then get her on in here&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(continuing)<br />
&#8230;But the safety of this base and its personnel are my main concern right now, as it should be yours. The Wraith have shown up on five of the last nine planets your team has visited, and given the fact that two of those worlds were unpopulated, we can pretty much assume that they're being alerted to your missions by someone on this base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If someone on this base was communicating with the Wraiths, then why hasn't Atlantis been attacked?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Maybe we should just stop using the Stargate indefinitely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We can't do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because we need ZPMs to power this place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
(blithely)<br />
They seem to be running fine right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. When the Wraith do show up, and they will, how do we defend ourselves?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or for that matter, how do we get back to Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
This is the only Stargate in the Pegasus galaxy that can even reach Earth, and if it comes to that, we're going to have to use a self-destruct before the Wraith take the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Bottom line, we need to use the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Then we've got to find out who's responsible A.S.A.P. I suggest we start by confining all non-base personnel to the south side of the complex.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you kidding?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
That's the absolute minimum we should do. If Colonel Sumner was still here&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's not!<br />
(more calmly, but still stern)<br />
I am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We're not going to start treating anyone like prisoners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That said, steps should be taken to safeguard the more sensitive areas of this facility. It's only reasonable.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard swallows uncomfortably.]
</p>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
I recommend no-go zones start with Stargate operations&#8212;the labs, power generation, and the jumper bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'd like to meet with every Athosian on this base. I mean, they've been here three months. I only know a handful of them by name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
I could start setting up interviews as soon as we're done here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And in the meantime, all gate travel is suspended until further notice.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla enters the room and starts to head up the stairwell to the control room. Two guards stationed half-way up the stairwell stop her.]
</p>
<blockquote>GUARD #1<br />
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't come up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm on my way to see Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD #1<br />
(firmly)<br />
That area is off-limits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Since when?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard jogs down the steps to meet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe there's been some sort of misunderstanding.</blockquote>
<p>[She spots McKay and Ford furtively heading across to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(confused)<br />
 I&#8230;was unaware a meeting had been called.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sighing)<br />
Let's take a walk.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What is happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There may be a security leak on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you certain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, not "certain" certain&#8230; But pretty&#8230;certain. It means we're going to have to take temporary precautions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Such as?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, like, uh, suspending gate travel, tightening security&#8230;getting to know your people a little better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You suspect an Athosian?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dr. Weir wants to meet them, that's all. It's not personal. Well&#8230;well, I mean, it is in the sense that she wants to meet them all personally&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(interrupting)<br />
You're aware of the horrors generations of my people have faced at the hands of the Wraith, and yet you would still question their loyalty?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, Teyla, that's not fair. You've got people running around Atlantis that she's never even met.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know each and every one of them. I would stake my life on their innocence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Well, perhaps you've noticed, but every time we step through the Stargate, bad guys try to kill us. And I'm getting a little tired of it. How about you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That does not mean&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(cutting her off)<br />
Look&#8230;all we're asking for is a little cooperation, that's all.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks furious, but Sheppard continues to give her a pleading expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(coldly)<br />
You shall have it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Halling sit across from each other in a small conference room. Bates observes while another military member transcribes the conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Halling. How's Jinto?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Well enough for a boy confined to his living quarters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sorry. It's temporary, but it is a necessary precaution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
So I've heard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Then I assume you know why we've arranged these meetings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
For the same reason my people can no longer go off-world or enter parts of the city. You no longer trust us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The truth, Halling&#8230;we don't know who to trust. Information regarding some off-world excursions has obviously found its way to the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Obviously?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They can't be lying in wait in every corner of this galaxy. They are tracking our movements, and we need to find out how. Your help with this would be greatly appreciated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Then by all means, how can I be of assistance?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Since you've been here on Atlantis, you've been off-world three times?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Yes. I've been acting as a guide on behalf of Sergeant Stackhouse's reconnaissance team, helping to establish relations between your people and some of our former trading partners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Stackhouse reported he lost track of you on a couple of these outings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
I did take the time to visit some close friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Interesting. Two of your three "visits" predated Wraith attacks by approximately a day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(admonishing)<br />
Sergeant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
What are you suggesting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
(with false innocence)<br />
I'm not suggesting anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
You think I would betray my own people? Jeopardize the life of my son?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No one is making accusations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
I disagree. You've already leapt to the conclusion that an Athosian is responsible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
(scoffing)<br />
Because it can't possibly be one of our own people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
No?</blockquote>
<p>[Bates quails under Halling's look and turns to Weir, who is also glaring at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(diplomatically, to Halling)<br />
We just need to clarify a few things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Then allow me. I lost my closest friend in the Wraith attack that forced us from our home-world. Selana, the woman you spoke to before me, lost both her parents. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find an Athosian who has not experienced loss at the hands of the Wraith! These are the people you accuse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We are not accusing anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
And I came here expecting an interview.<br />
(he stands)<br />
Not an interrogation.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. Bates and Weir exchange frustrated looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and McKay work in the rear compartment of a jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I mean, I don't think it's too much to ask.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Nothing, nothing. I just cannot bear the same meal day after day after day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, buck up a little. I'm trying to run a diagnostic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, we are stranded with limited resources in another galaxy. I mean, come on, the nearest Bob's Big Boy is 300 million light years away. We have to make do. If that means you have to eat my favorite food two days in a row, so be it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You enjoy military rations?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(absently)<br />
I know. It's weird. Hospital food, too. The only reason I don't like airplane food is you can't get seconds, and I'm an absolute&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[His computer beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a command subroutine I've never seen before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What is its function?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(petulant)<br />
I don't know, because I've never seen it before. Okay, I'm going to cross-reference this with the, uh, Ancient database up in the control room. I'm just going to grab the, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts to leave. Zelenka reaches for the monitor display hanging from the cables. Just after he touches it, a mechanical humming sound starts over their heads. McKay hurries back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What did you touch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(backing away, innocent)<br />
Nothing, nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You were just&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, no, no&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[There is a louder hum and McKay and Zelenka race out of the jumper to track its source.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[They look up to see the roof has retracted and the sun is shining directly down on them from the opening to the sky.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I had no idea the roof could do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Neither did I.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATHOSIAN QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[A group of Athosians, including Halling, sit in the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>ATHOSIAN #1<br />
The gate room and surrounding sections have been closed to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATHOSIAN #2<br />
And we may no longer have access to the medical facility without escort. We're under constant surveillance, our movements restricted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ATHOSIAN #1<br />
How long must we put up with this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
It's already been too long.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens and Teyla enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I would have expected to be included in this discussion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
As we would have expected you to take a stand in our defense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They have taken action to protect everyone on this base. That includes each and every one of you. The presence of a Wraith collaborator threatens us all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Then you support Dr. Weir's decision to confine us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Halling, we are their guests.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
We've become more like their prisoners&#8230; But unlike prisoners, we can choose to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where would you go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Do you not mean to say, "Where would <i>we</i> go?"</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla is taken aback.]
</p>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
We have friends on other worlds who would gladly take us in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
For how long? Good trading partners do not necessarily make good hosts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
There are many worlds among the stars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith have awakened. No world is safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Nor is it safe to remain. They will continue to do this until they find someone to blame.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You know in your heart that none of our people could be responsible for this!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(insistently)<br />
Then we have nothing to fear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
You trust Dr. Weir that much?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
More than you would trust your own people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No! I understand her responsibility. Halling, we have met with the Wraith off-world so often and so quickly. There must be a reason beyond coincidence. Give them a chance to find it.</blockquote>
<p>[Halling sits. They all look abashed, but still troubled.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not approve of some of their measures, but I do know that in the end, they will help to prove our innocence. Atlantis is far more than shelter. It is hope! Not only for our people, but for everyone who would stand against the Wraith. We must not abandon that hope.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
They may reside here, Teyla, but they're not the Ancestors, no matter how much you wish them to be.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Ford runs to catch up to Sheppard. Ford carries a large paper bag in one hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sir!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I heard they got the sun-roof open on the jumper bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I also heard you're planning to take a jumper out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I figure that's what the door in the roof is for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Anyone else call shotgun?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(casually)<br />
I was just going to drive around the planet, check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(with mock casualness)<br />
Oh, you're just checking out the planet? Uh, never mind, then. That's cool. I mean, I've got better things to do than cruise around a planet in a space ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're like a kid, you know that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(grinning)<br />
Yes, sir. I brought along something to eat on the ride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford holds up the bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How about a nice&#8230;turkey sandwich?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shakes his head, relenting.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Send in whoever's next, please.</blockquote>
<p>[The guard opens one panel of the room to find Teyla standing outside. Weir stands and smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla&#8230;I wasn't expecting you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I was surprised to be left off your list.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I didn't feel it was necessary in your case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(sitting)<br />
On the contrary. You should have spoken to me first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're right. I should have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I can tell you anything you need to know about my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Is it possible you don't know them all as well as you think?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla barely spares Bates a glance before turning back to Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I empathize with you, Dr. Weir. As leaders, we are often forced to make difficult decisions in the interests of those we serve, but many of my fellow Athosians are not so&#8230; understanding.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know, but there's nothing I can do about that now. People can suspect my motives for these meetings all they want, but you and I need to agree that we have a problem. I have to do whatever I can to get to the bottom of it.. And right now, that means sitting down and talking with every single person here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You should know there is talk of leaving Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(surprised)<br />
I hope it doesn't come to that.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla stands.]

Not all change is for the worse.</blockquote>

No, it's good, it's good. I'm all good. All good.</blockquote>
<p>[In the clearing, the lead Wraith bends down and picks up the pendant lying on the ground. He airily looks around.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quietly into radio)<br />
Teyla&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He peeks around the other side of the wall to see Teyla's position. He gives her hand signals, and she nods in acknowledgement, hitting the detonator on the explosives. Caught by surprise, the Wraith are trying to get away from this attack when Sheppard and McKay start shooting from their position. Teyla and Ford also shoot their warrior. Teyla breaks cover to continue firing until her weapon jams.]
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay down one of the warriors, but he starts to get back up. Stackhouse's team break cover to help corral the other Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>STACKHOUSE<br />
This one's ours, boys. Tasers.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla runs to meet the others, discarding her useless rifle. She notices the lead Wraith sneaking away and gives chase.]
</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay, Stackhouse and one of his team surround the Wraith and all fire tasers at him. The Wraith drops to the ground.]
</p><p>[Teyla starts shooting the lead Wraith with her Beretta. The Wraith keeps coming, finally knocking her back bodily. She instantly gets to her feet and grabs a nearby stick, twirling it expertly.]
</p><p>[Sheppard's team warily approach the downed Wraith. They notice a device blinking on the warrior's chest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a self-destruct! Take cover!</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone dives towards the ruins as the warrior explodes into nothing.]
</p><p>[Elsewhere, Teyla uses her weapon to fight the Wraith.]
</p><p>[From Ford's position, he sees the aftermath of the warrior's self-destruct, but can see none of his team through the smoke.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Major! Dr. McKay!</blockquote>
<p>[Pieces of Wraith fall around McKay and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to McKay)<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with irony)<br />
I'm fine. This is&#8230;this is fun for me.</blockquote>
<p>[He groans and rolls over as Sheppard gets up, holding the warrior's stunner.]
</p><p>[Teyla uses two sticks, but her moves become more desperate. The Wraith finally knocks her down, instantly seizing on his advantage. He raises his hand to feed, but is downed by a Wraith stunner blast fired by Sheppard. He reaches towards a device on his wrist, but Sheppard knocks his hands apart with the tip of the stunner weapon and holds one arm down with his foot.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Easy. Don't go blowing yourself up.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Sheppard exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Weir exits a room to see Teyla passing by, wearing full Athosian gear.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla. Excuse me. I was hoping to catch you before you headed back to the mainland. I hear they're doing well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Very well. According to Halling, they're busily planting crops for the next harvest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm glad to hear it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will tell them what has happened. Hopefully, in time, we will all be able to put the events of the past week behind us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes. I am aware that the last few days have been particularly difficult for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe, Dr. Weir, that in your place, I would have done the same.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla smiles and nods, then leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DUSK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS PRISON CELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard paces around the outside of the cell. It is a cube with horizontal thick shelves as bars and an invisible energy shield. The Wraith stands in the center of the cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>MALE WRAITH<br />
Again? Your kind is persistent. I would have thought you'd have given up by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, hell, I've got all the time in the world. Now, you, on the other hand&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith stalks towards Sheppard and tries to grab him, but is repelled by the energy shield.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Ancients were pretty good at shields and stuff like that, weren't they?</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith grunts.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I give you a week&#8230; Maybe two, tops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALE WRAITH<br />
You waste your time. I will provide you with no information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I wonder what hurts more, the gunshot wound or the hunger&#8230; because I'd love to help out, but how did McKay put it? "We can't meet your dietary requirements."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALE WRAITH<br />
When I'm free, you'll be the first that I feed upon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(unconcerned)<br />
Okey-dokey. I'm going to go make myself a sandwich.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MALE WRAITH<br />
Human. You think you've won a victory by my capture, but by bringing me here, you've only hastened your own doom. It's only a matter of time before the others of my kind come to rescue me, and when they do, there will be nowhere in this world you can hide.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(with mock sympathy)<br />
Stay positive, now.</blockquote>
