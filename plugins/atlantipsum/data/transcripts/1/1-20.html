<p>As the Wraith attack on Atlantis begins, the team is bolstered by the appearance of reinforcements from Earth armed with nuclear warheads and good news: The battleship <i>Daedalus</i> is due to arrive in four days. But when the warheads are easily destroyed by the Wraith, it becomes increasingly clear that the reinforcements aren't enough to protect the city for four hours, let alone four days!<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_1.20_%22The_Siege_Part_2%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 1.20 &quot;The Siege Part 2&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters, still in the red jumpsuit he had worn on the Puddle Jumper. Weir and Sheppard are there, Weir carrying a briefcase.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Welcome back, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Our scanners show the hive ships have started moving again, although their pace has slowed considerably.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Obviously, you gave them something to think about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If they get here in two hours or two days, it doesn't change the fact that we're out of options. We can't hope to fight them. So, unless either of you have any more ideas&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Ford arrives, geared up and holding a machine gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
The last group is assembled and ready for evac.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, then. Let's get this done.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Weir, and McKay each stand at a different laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ready?</blockquote>
<p>[They each enter their passwords. After a moment, a clock shows ten hours and counting.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Self-destruct is armed.<br />
(to Technician)<br />
Prepare to load the virus into the Ancient mainframe. Rodney, dial the Alpha site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dialing.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to dial, but stops when chevrons start lighting up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've got an incoming wormhole.</blockquote>
<p>[The wormhole forms.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're receiving an IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(amazed)<br />
Stargate Command.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Positive!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Lower the shields.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Col. Everett and other personnel start coming through the 'gate, as well as boxes of supplies. Sheppard and the others rush down to meet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Colonel Dillon Everett, United States Marine Corps.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You should know&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
General O'Neill sends his compliments on a job well done under extraordinary circumstances. You are relieved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sir, we're about to evacuate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Without a fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
On my order.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
That evacuation order is rescinded. I assume you've armed the self-destruct device?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, sir, we have, but as Dr. Weir was trying to tell you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
I am going to need you to disarm it immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hold on a second, Colonel. I don't think you fully grasp our situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
You have three Wraith hive ships bearing down on your position and precious little to defend yourselves with. That about sum it up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You got our message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
We got your message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's down to two hive ships. We managed to destroy one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(brightly)<br />
Good for you. That should make my job a little easier.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What exactly is your job, sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(very militarily)<br />
I should think that would be obvious to you by now, Major. We are going to defend Atlantis at all costs.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everett is walking away, up the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(handing her a piece of paper)<br />
Signed by General O'Neill.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel, it's not that we don't appreciate the thought, but if you had read the report on the armada headed this way, you'd know that there's not much we can do about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Oh, I read your report cover to cover, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They must have found a ZPM. That's the only way they could have dialed in from Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
It was discovered in Egypt by a group of archaeologists. The damn thing has been under our noses the whole time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fantastic. Wait a minute. How could you possibly bring the ZPM back here? You need it to maintain the wormhole.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
As we speak, it is being transported up to the <i>Daedalus</i>, our new battlecruiser.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sister ship of the <i>Prometheus</i>. I didn't even know it was finished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
With the ZPM boosting her engines, she should be here inside of four days. That is how long we have to hold this base. Major Sheppard dial Pegasus Alpha Site, recall all military personnel. As well, any civilians who would like to return and help take part in damage control are welcome to do so. And when you're done with that, please join me and my officers in the conference room. We'll discuss our tactical position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel Everett? Fine, you're in charge, but I should be at that briefing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
When it comes down to any other aspect of Atlantis, I will be happy to include you. We're talking about our tactical position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I understand that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Good. Somebody want to please turn off that self-destruct?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everett is being briefed.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
This schematic is based on the information we got in your message. Can I assume it's accurate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Captain, deploy plan alpha-two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RADNER<br />
Yes, Sir. Sergeant, alpha-two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
If you don't mind my asking, Colonel, deploy what exactly?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
We brought along a few rail guns. They were originally slated for <i>Prometheus</i> to replace their current close-in armament on her next refit. They will deliver an impact velocity of Mach 5 at 250 miles. A standard magazine will hold 10,000 rounds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Whoa.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Weir arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The self-destruct has been aborted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Thank you. Did you contact the Alpha Site?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I asked Major Sheppard to wait until I had a chance to talk with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Is that a fact?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Major, dial the Alpha site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel, you've been here all of five minutes. Now, I have been responsible for the lives of the people on this base both military and civilian, for the past several months. I'm not about to put those lives in jeopardy until I at least know how you intend to defend this city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
I don't need to explain myself to you, Doctor, and I don't need your cooperation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But you could probably use mine. Sir. So with all due respect, please answer Dr. Weir's question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Is that a threat, Major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, sir. I understand you need to establish a clear chain of command, but if you cut Dr. Weir out of the loop, you'll only alienate the people whose trust and respect she's earned. Which is everyone on the base. Including me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Is that a fact? &#8230;Have a seat.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay talks to Zelenka and other scientists.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I should be in that meeting. I am the foremost expert on the defense capabilities of this city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You know how it is. When military steps in, scientists take a back seat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Until they need us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
They don't think they need us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, they don't think they need us right up until the point that they need us, and then&#8230;they need us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Then they need us. Take a look at this.</blockquote>
<p>[They look down into the control room where SGC personnel are un-crating weapons.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Six Naquadah-enhanced nuclear warheads, twelve hundred megatons apiece. They emit almost zero EM and are otherwise invisible to radar. Once deployed, they will detonate by proximity fuse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Space mines?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RADNER<br />
That's right. We'll use jumpers in stealth mode to place them in a pattern between the armada and Atlantis. Major, we were hoping you could help us with that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, but I recommend keeping a couple in reserve.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Negative. We're only going to get one shot at this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you have to consider the possibility&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Four of my men are pilots. Beckett is giving them the gene inoculation right now. Assuming it takes, you will familiarize them with the jumpers, and they will become our fighter screen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Along with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
I have another job for you. I understand that this base is equipped with a chair weapons platform, like the one we found in Antarctica.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, but we have no way of powering it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
We do now. We brought a Mark II Naquadah generator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RADNER<br />
We found a way to increase the power output by six hundred percent. It won't last nearly as long, but it should power the chair for as long as we need it to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is beginning to sound like a plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
I'm glad you approve.<br />
(officiously)<br />
We know this is a long shot, but like I said, all we have to do is hold out until the <i>Daedalus</i> gets here, then we can use the ZPM to power the city shield. Any questions? All right, then.<br />
(condescending)<br />
Now that Dr. Weir has been informed of our plans, I would greatly appreciate it if you'd execute my order and contact the Alpha Site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
And Major. This is last time I give you an order twice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY</b>
</p><p>[Personnel assemble the rail guns.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard briefs the new pilots on flying the Puddle Jumpers.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka work to connect the chair to the naquadah generator.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Four Puddle Jumpers leave Atlantis.]

</p><p>[Both civilians and military personnel receive arms.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Jumpers fly through space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRAINING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla spars with a male Athosian, each of them holding a knife and stick. Everett and some of his men watch from the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(impressed)<br />
You must be Teyla.</blockquote>
<p>[They stop sparring, and she touches foreheads with the man.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And you are Colonel Everett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Major Sheppard spoke very highly of you in his report. Of course, a more recent report has me a little concerned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You think I may once again fall under the influence of the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Major Sheppard assures me that won't happen, but I do need you to stay out of the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(angry)<br />
Do you not need every able body to help defend Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
I think we can handle it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CHAIR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett is in the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's not even trying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We've tried this a dozen times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
But never with this power source.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm serious. Major Sheppard's your man.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course he is, but he's training pilots and deploying space mines right now, so we're stuck with you. Now, listen to me very carefully, do exactly what I tell you to do, and hopefully no one will get hurt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, there must be someone else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sternly)<br />
Concentrate on powering up the chair. Nothing else, nothing more, nothing but. Don't start thinking&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Don't tell me what not to start thinking about, or I'll start thinking about it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(falsely kind)<br />
Please power it up.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett closes his eyes and concentrates. The chair powers up.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at a tablet)<br />
Good. Good&#8230; Good. And&#8230;oh, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What? Did I do something wrong?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
So&#8230;see? Nothing to worry about.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay comes back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Get him out of the chair.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Elizabeth. Excuse me. I've hooked up the generator, and the chair platform is operational.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
That's good news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why? What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're down to just a few dozen drones.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
And you're just finding this out now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There was no way of determining that until the chair was initialized, and that was only possible once the Mark II was tied in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
The chair in Antarctica controlled thousands of the damn things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. I know. They were probably used defending Atlantis the first time the Wraith attacked the Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Even a few dozen will help us keep them at bay for a while.</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm starts blaring.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
We have incoming. I don't know where they came from. They just appeared all of a sudden.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rushes in.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We've just detected a wave of objects approaching the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
How many?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
A hundred plus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How come they weren't detected by the long-range sensors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because they're rocks&#8230; Asteroids. The Wraith must have harvested them from this system's asteroid belt and accelerated them towards us from a safe distance. The mainframe's taken this long to determine that they were a threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can they do much damage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yeah. Even if most of them burn off in the atmosphere, but&#8230;that's not why they're doing it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
They're headed toward the mines.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, can they be deactivated?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[The display shows the asteroids approaching the mines. All of the mines explode in seconds.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230;that's that. Your mines make one hell of a bang, Colonel. I'm sure the Wraiths' ears are ringing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's the status of the hive ships?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no way of knowing. The mine detonations must have overloaded the sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
How long till they're back up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
There's a lot of residual radiation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It'll keep us blind for hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, well, they're still out there, and we just lost our primary line of defense.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS ANCIENT ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You wanted to see me, Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
I was told I could learn a lot about the history of Atlantis in this room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We haven't used it much because of the power requirements.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Still, I would like to see for myself how the Ancients lost the first time, try to avoid their mistakes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, Sir, we could do that.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard activates the console. A display appears above them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is the status of the Pegasus Galaxy before the Ancients encountered the Wraith. The blue stars represent systems either inhabited by or protected by the Ancients. Then&#8230; This is how it looked after they fought for almost a hundred years.</blockquote>
<p>[All of the blue stars turn red.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Until Atlantis was all that was left?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, sir. That's when the siege began.</blockquote>
<p>[A planetary-scale display appears. Various battles are portrayed as Sheppard speaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For several more years, the Atlantians were able to hold off their attackers, relying on the city's shield and superior weaponry, including the weapons satellite system. No matter how many Wraith ships they destroyed, more kept coming here. They could win almost every battle, but they saw no way to win the war. So&#8230;they submerged the city&#8230;and left.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard deactivates the console.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's it. That's the story. But the picture is pretty clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
So you think this is a no-win situation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, sir. What I mean is, even if we beat them this time, they're going to come back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Major&#8230;I think I should tell you that Colonel Marshall Sumner was a very good friend of mine. We served together a lot of years and you know&#8230;I cannot, for the life of me, figure how it is that you could go as far as you did and not save him. How you could get that close&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
By the time I reached Colonel Sumner&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Worse, you admit to firing the shot that killed him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because I believe that's what he wanted me to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
You knew him that well, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You weren't there, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Everett approaches Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
I wish, for his sake, I was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There isn't a night that doesn't go by where that moment doesn't play in my head&#8230; And every time it does&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[An alarm sounds.]
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT AND SHEPPARD<br />

Control room&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Colonel Everett. Report.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SOLDIER<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sir, we've just detected a wave of darts inbound.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm on my way.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Head to the chair. We'll finish this later.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Multiple signals, sir, closing fast. Dr. McKay must've been right about the nukes damaging the sensors. We couldn't see them until they were right on top of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
Are my gunners in position?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
How about our damage control parties?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They're all in position.</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERETT<br />
All right. Darken the city.</blockquote>

It'll take a minute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We don't have a minute.</blockquote>
<p>[He sits in the chair.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, this generator can only power the chair because it operates in a state of barely-controlled overload&#8212;</blockquote>
