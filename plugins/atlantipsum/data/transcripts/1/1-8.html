<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team and Weir sit at the table. McKay is eating a sandwich and drinking coffee.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They call themselves the Genii. They are simple people, but good farmers and fair traders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We're still months away from producing successful crops on the mainland, and we're heading towards a food shortage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know. It's getting desperate. We're almost out of coffee.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe you should stop drinking eleven cups a day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm just making sure I get my fair share before it's all gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sounds fair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm all for trade, but don't you think we should find a way to help defend ourselves?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How can a bunch of farmers do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, maybe they can introduce us to people who can help. In the meantime, let's take care of the basics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I guess it's always good to get to know your neighbors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Genii Stargate is a short distance from their village. I suggest we walk. The Puddle Jumper may alarm them. As I said, they are very simple.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Sounds like a mission.</blockquote>
<p>[Smiling, she gets up and leaves. Teyla looks at McKay, who is still eating.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;GENII PLANET</b>
</p><p>[The team exits the Stargate at start walking through the high grass.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Where to, Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We should allow them to come to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, if you know where the village is&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They are simple people and they trust me, but that trust was hard earned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it you said they grow here, anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Many things, but they are best known for a bean known as Tava.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, java?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tava.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How will they even know we're here, anyway?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They already do.</blockquote>
<p>[A man and woman dressed in simple clothing approach them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They look friendly enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The eldest one is called Tyrus. I've traded with him on many occasions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
Teyla Emmagan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Tyrus. It has been many days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
Too many.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is Major Sheppard, Dr. McKay and Lieutenant Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
My daughter, Sora.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You must be very proud.</blockquote>
<p>[He smile, and Sora smiles back flirtatiously.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
(sternly)<br />
She's betrothed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, I wasn't hitting on your daughter. I just thought&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They have come to trade for a share of your crops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
Yet you bring weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Only to defend ourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
Do you dress as they do of your own accord?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Of course. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He wants to know if you work with us&#8230;or for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ah. These are my friends, Tyrus. I would not have brought them if I did not think them worthy to become yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
We'll take you to see Cowen.<br />
(to Sora)<br />
Go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
Follow me.</blockquote>
<p>[Tyrus watches as the team follows Sora away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Maybe we should offer a sense of humor in trade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure. They can have yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(laughing sarcastically)<br />
Oh, please, my side. You slay me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm thinking about it.</blockquote>
<p>[Behind them, Tyrus speaks into an advanced communications device on his wrist.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
I'm bringing them in. All operations to silent mode.</blockquote>
<p>[He follows the others.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;GENII VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The village is primitive with wooden structures, similar to the 19th century on Earth.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[The team is at a table with some Genii, including Cowen, Tyrus, and Sora.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
And these medicines are potent?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They are capable of stopping bacterial infections entirely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
It would help us through a harsh winter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Hmm. We will need more than you offer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
More?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't think you understand how cool this medicine is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Well, leave if you wish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(surprised)<br />
Leave?<br />
(to Teyla)<br />
I thought you said the Genii were fair traders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling at Cowen)<br />
We have always been able to achieve a reasonable bargain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
You ask for much of our harvest. New crops will have to be planted in sufficient quantities to replenish our stores, or it is the Genii who will starve. That amount of planting will require new land to be cleared. Clearing more land is slow, hard work, and it will lose us a great amount of growing time between now and the next harvest season.</blockquote>
<p>[As he speaks, McKay rolls his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. What if clearing land was fast and easy?</blockquote>
<p>[Cowen and Tyrus laugh.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
You know a simple way of uprooting the stump of a 300-year-old tree?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
As a matter of fact&#8230;I do.</blockquote>
<p>EXT&#8212;GENII village
</p><p>[As the straw-hat wearing villagers look on, Ford sets some charges on a large tree stump.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Cover your ears.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It can be quite loud.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford jogs over to the group.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on. You're going to wish you did. Lieutenant?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford pulls out his remote detonator readies it.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Fire in the hole.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone covers their ears. Smiling, he pushes the detonator button. The tree stump blows up completely. The Genii are amazed.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It's called C-4.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
If you can supply us with a sufficient quantity of C-4, we will supply you with the crop you require.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, this instead of the medicine?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
As well as the medicine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Really? That wasn't impressive enough?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
It is you who are in need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I'll have to discuss this with my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
I'm sure we can come to terms. Teyla, thank you for bringing us these new trading partners. Please, stay as our guests. There will be a Harvest Ceremony later.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Wonderful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're talking Harvest Ceremony.</blockquote>
<p>[He nods his head in mock sincerity.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sounds like fun, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll be back soon.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks away, back toward the 'gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I should go back with the Major.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves also. Tyrus and Sora lead Teyla and Ford the other way.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir closes her office door and turns to Sheppard in agitation.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Explosives? This is a scientific expedition, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But you want us to become arms dealers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have you ever tried to clear a stump by hand?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
Yes. As a hobby.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir sits behind her desk.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They are taking a chance by giving us so much of their crop this year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Plus the medicines I already agreed to? I think in the future, Major, I should do the negotiating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I did say I had to ask you first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Uh-huh&#8230;To terms you already agreed to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do you see why I have a problem with this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do we need food or not? We are on the verge of rationing and as much as I'd like to devote every off-world mission to the pursuit of Tava beans&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I get your point. Tell them we agree.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;GENII VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Everyone has gathered for the celebration. Sheppard and McKay have not yet returned.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
(raising a toast)<br />
We give thanks for a plentiful harvest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALL<br />
We give thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
May next season be as fruitful. And to our new friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
New friends.</blockquote>
<p>[They take a sip of the drink. Ford coughs on his.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Moonshine?</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I thought you were man enough.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;GENII PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay walk back toward the village, or try to.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You have no idea which way to go, do you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just trying to get my bearings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Translation, "I'm lost." They were very clear which route to take.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I prefer a straight line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, of course, because everything's a shortcut in Sheppard's world.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's scanner beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, there it is again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm picking up a strange reading from right over there.</blockquote>
<p>[He points to what looks like the entrance to barn.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Define strange.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You don't know what strange means?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know what strange means, Rodney&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Weird, freakish, odd&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm just trying to determine whether it's worth getting off the route back to the village.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's radioactive readings in an Amish world. Your call. Look, we're lost anyway. What difference does it make?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I am not lost&#8230; All right, let's check it out.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay's scanner has continued beeping.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII BARN</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard approach and enter. They follow the scanner's readings to a pile of straw. They remove the straw to reveal a large, metal hatch device about two feet high. It doesn't match the level of technology of the village.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, now, that is definitely&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Strange.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, not that Amish, really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, not so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe they don't even know it's here.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard touches one of the hinges. His hand comes away oily.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This hatch has been oiled recently. We have to check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really? Of course we do.</blockquote>
<p>[They lift the heavy door together. McKay turns on his rifle flashlight and shines it in. Sheppard moves to start climbing down into it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p>[They climb down a short ladder to an underground chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The construction's architecturally advanced. I don't think the Genii could've made this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We need to tell Ford where we are.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Lieutenant, come in. Ford?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay consults his beeping scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This place is built like a bunker. It must be shielded for RF. The reading's stronger this way.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shines his rifle-mounted flashlight around the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What kind of readings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
Palm readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's neutron radiation. It's definitely a&#8230;a powerful energy source.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Let's check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I really think we should-we should get out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard ignores him, moving further inside. He comes to a large metal door. After checking it out, he slides it open.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now, this is strange.</blockquote>
<p>[Inside is a huge cavern of modern equipment and a waterfall in the distance. Suddenly, three men in military-style uniforms appear behind them, pointing large guns at them.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;GENII TAVERN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[A man comes in via an interior door and whispers something to Cowen. Cowen then approaches Sora, Tyrus, Ford, and Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
If you'll excuse me, I must go tend to a dispute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is everything all right, Cowen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
I will return shortly.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves. Teyla looks questioningly at Ford.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII INTERROGATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard are seated at a table, their field gear lying on it. Soldiers have weapons pointed at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe they exist as two separate cultures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe. Who cares? How long are you boys planning on keeping us here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know if people could just learn to keep their secret underground hatches locked&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The metal doors behind them swing open and someone enters. They turn to see who it is.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So much for two separate cultures.</blockquote>
<p>[It is Cowen, now also dressed in a military uniform.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
(as if to himself)<br />
What am I going to do?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[The villagers have stopped celebrating; now they stare at Teyla and Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'm getting a weird vibe all of a sudden.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I agree. I have never seen the Genii behave this way.</blockquote>
<p>[They stand up.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Listen, we're just going to step outside and see if Major Sheppard and Dr. McKay are back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
No one must leave. It's not safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
There's a Wraith ship in the area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Wraith? Are you serious?</blockquote>
<p>[Tyrus stares back but doesn't respond.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We need to warn our friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
You will draw them to us. Everyone must stay indoors.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GENII INTERROGATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Cowen searches through all the equipment McKay and Sheppard had on them. He picks up McKay's scanner.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Can we be careful with that? It's just it's rather fragile, and if it, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Cowen tosses it carelessly onto the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
We have a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then we have something in common.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Normally, you would already have been shot for discovering our secret.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In which case, more of our people would show up and question our disappearance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
We would simply tell them the Wraith took you. With no evidence to the contrary, they would believe us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You were saying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
You have technology, knowledge new to us. This C-4 of yours&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's not for blowing up stumps.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
We have a more sophisticated application for it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look what you people do with your C-4 is none of our business. We just need food. As far as your little secret down here goes, well, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We say, "What giant, underground bunker?"</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gestures his agreement.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
I want more than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe we can give you&#8230;more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
You have weapons more powerful than your C-4?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you kidding? "Weapons 'R' Us." We&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(after giving McKay a stern look)<br />
We might.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
What if I wanted more than weapons?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, did I mention that I know almost everything about almost everything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
For Teyla Emmagan to have joined with you, you must have something much more&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look I'm going to go out on a limb here and just say that we're looking for allies against the Wraith. How about you guys?</blockquote>
<p>[Cowen considers this.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENII TAVERN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Listen, we just want to take a look outside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
We can't let you. It's not safe.</blockquote>
<p>[Two men come in behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We can take care of ourselves.</blockquote>
<p>[Tyrus's wrist communicator activates, and a voice comes from it.]
</p>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Tyrus, please respond.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
Receiving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Bring them.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ford are shocked.]
</p>
<blockquote>TYRUS<br />
Understood.<br />
(to Teyla and Ford)<br />
Relinquish your weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[Several men raise their weapons on them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
You will not be harmed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You guys are full of surprises.</blockquote>
<p>[The men usher them away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;GENNI UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Now dressed in military uniform, Sora and Tyrus lead Ford and Teyla into the interrogation chamber. They take seats next to Sheppard and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You missed a hell of a Harvest Ceremony, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can imagine. Oh. Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am as surprised as you are by all of this, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. I'm pretty surprised.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Teyla and her people know us only as the simple farmers we show outsiders. The secrecy of who and what we are is the only defense we have against the Wraith.<br />
(to his men)<br />
One day, all that will change.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You think you can do that with an atomic bomb?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Now it's you who surprise me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, radioactive readings, your fascination with our C-4&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shocked, to McKay)<br />
You're just mentioning this now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It just came to me when he said, "One day, all that will change." I assume you're hoping our C-4 will solve your super-criticality problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
Will it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It might. Depends on your design. There's a host of other considerations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know how to make an A-bomb?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Major, most of my high school chess team could design an A-bomb. The actual hard part is having sufficient fissionable materials of appropriate grade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
And we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COWEN<br />
(walking around the table as he speaks)<br />
The Genii were once a great confederation of planets. Millennia ago, the Wraith had driven us to the brink of total annihilation. Our forefathers sought the protection of bunkers such as these, originally created for wars long forgotten, and it was here that a small number of our people managed to survive undetected. Over the course of many, many years&#8212;generation after generation&#8212; we have made technological developments here in secret.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

That's the part we're still working on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So even if were to have helped the Genii build nuclear warheads&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We only could have nuked a handful of them simultaneously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
There's far too many Wraith ships for a coordinated attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The Genii plan never would have worked&#8230;with or without our help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
I'll see what else I can find.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you, Peter.</blockquote>
<p>[Grodin leaves. Weir and Sheppard walk toward the balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You might be happy to know Sergeant Bates was able to broker a small trade agreement for food while you were gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, he did, did he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, he did, but it's not a competition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So who are these people?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They're traders. They call themselves Manarians. I'm sorry you weren't able to find the allies you were looking for, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we gathered some valuable intel. That's something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Huh. Are you trying to convince me this is good news?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I much prefer to know what we're up against than not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Sixty ships&#8230;or more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I just hope they don't all come at once.</blockquote>
