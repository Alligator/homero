<p>The Atlantis team discovers a stasis chamber holding a woman who appears to be over 10,000 years old. Excited at the possibility that she is one of the alien race that built Atlantis, the team decides to bring her out of stasis despite the risks to her health. But everyone is shocked when, once reanimated, the elderly woman identifies herself as none other than Dr. Weir!<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_1.15_%22Before_I_Sleep%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 1.15 &quot;Before I Sleep&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY</b>
</p><p>[Weir is there. Sheppard steps out to join her. He is geared up and carrying a backpack.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey, I was just stealing a breath of fresh air. I thought you were off exploring the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
About to.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls out a bundle wrapped in maroon fabric.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I picked this up on the mainland. The Athosians made it. Happy birthday.</blockquote>
<p>[She unwraps it. It's an old ceramic pot.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm. It's beautiful. How did you find out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Mum's the word.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay watches a large display of Atlantis.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
All right, we're done with the living quarters. We're moving on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa, before you go, did you see anything better than our current quarters?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Teyla, and Ford explore the dark hallway, using flashlights.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
A few. Some of them are pretty nice, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, what kind of square footage are we talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
What am I, your realtor, Rodney? We're here to unlock the secrets of Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yeah, well, I'm looking for a one-bedroom with a den. Preferably with a balcony, but I'm not married to it. Look&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Sir, check this out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
We might as well be comfortable, at least until the Wraith get here&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Shut up for a second.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins Ford at the entrance to a room. They look inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LABORATORY</b>
</p><p>[They enter the room. The lights come on.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
What? What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Some sort of laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
We've come across dozens of those. The city's full of them. Something unusual about it?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard passes his hand over a console, and it lights up. In front of them, a chamber lights up to reveal a very old woman standing up inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'd have to say&#8230;yes.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p>[A large group has gathered in front of the stasis chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we could stand here looking at her all day. What we've got to do is get her out of this box.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, we can't take that chance. Look at her. She's at least a hundred years old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which is why every second counts. I mean, she could drop dead while we stand here arguing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How can she drop dead? You said she was frozen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Technically, she's in a state of metabolic stasis. Aging slowed considerably, yes, but not entirely suspended.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are saying this woman is still alive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Life-sign systems indicate viability. According to the initial data I've been able to access, she's been in that chamber for ten thousand years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Ten thousand years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't look a day over nine thousand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She'll continue to age at a very slow rate until she dies, which, judging by the look of her, seems more likely to occur sooner rather than later&#8230;bringing me back to my original point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look at her. She's so old, I'm afraid the process of reviving her might actually kill her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We cannot let this chance to talk to a living, breathing Ancient slip through our fingers. Again.</blockquote>
<p>[He gives Sheppard a sour look, and Sheppard scowls back at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And who knows what state of mind she'll be in? Not to mention the fact that she might carrying some horrifying contagion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And who knows what she knows about our city? More importantly, does she know about any ZPMs lying around?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ah, there's a thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Revive her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But, doctor&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's my call.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and McKay step away to the control station.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And the whole time we thought the city was abandoned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is it possible the Atlanteans left her behind when they abandoned the city for Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe she wanted to stay behind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Maybe they forgot about her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In which case, she's going to be really pissed when she wakes up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If she remembers anything at all.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, the old woman is out of the chamber and lying on a table as Beckett tends to her.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Breathing, shallow. Pulse, rapid. I'll run an EEG to determine any brain activity.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett takes a piece of paper from her hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir opens it, and McKay reads it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It’s gate addresses, five of them. M7G-677. We've been to this planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Dr. Weir&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla has noticed the woman has opened her eyes. The woman looks at Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hello. Can you hear me?</blockquote>
<p>[She doesn't respond. McKay waves his hand above her face.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Freezer burn.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I thought she wasn't frozen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ten thousand years, you expect her to dance a bloody jig?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but it's the eyes, Carson. You got to look at the eyes. The lights are on but nobody's home. Doesn't take a medical professional to know that&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of course she can see us&#8230;and hear us. Hello. How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
It worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
She said, "It worked."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I assume something worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, that's very sharp.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hello? Huh. She fell asleep. When she's a bit more stable, transfer her to the infirmary. And I want video on her at all times, recording everything. We might not get a second chance at anything she may say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let's hope we get a first, huh?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay lounge in front of big-screen display of the Atlantis lay-out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Too big, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not saying it's too big. I'm just pointing out its dimensions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hmm. It's not that big&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Gentlemen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We were just wondering whether there are any other frozen bodies out there in Atlantis that we haven't discovered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And I was just saying there's no way of knowing in the short term. It'd be like searching every room in every building in Manhattan. It'll take a while. God knows what other kinds of surprises are out there, not showing up on the sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ah, that's what we're here to find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Dr. Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
You'd better come to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Is our patient awake?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Aye, and she's saying the most peculiar things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
On our way.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[The old woman lies on an infirmary bed, monitors attached and running. Weir and McKay arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She's drifting in and out, still very weak, but there's something a wee bit odd about this woman. She called me Carson. She knows my name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe she overheard you talking to someone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No. I was alone in here when she woke up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What about subconsciously? I've heard stories of coma patients being able to hear&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, no, it's more than that. She knows things.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir approaches the woman.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
Look at you. I didn't think I'd see any of you again. Missed you all so terribly&#8230; Even you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You see?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sorry? Do we know you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
Oh, yes. I'm you, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Time travel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's what she said. She&#8230;somehow found a way to travel back in time to when the Ancients inhabited the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How did she&#8230;do this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That will be one of the first questions I ask her when she wakes up again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If she ever wakes up again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Let's not be too quick to exclude the possibility that the woman might be, um&#8230; What is the clinical term? "Nuts?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
She may be senile, yes, but that doesn't explain how she knows so much about all of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Is time travel even possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, there's nothing in the laws of physics to prevent it. Extremely difficult to achieve, mind you. You need the technology to manipulate black holes to create wormholes not only through points in space, but time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not to mention a really nice DeLorean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't even get me started on that movie.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I like that movie.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Results of the DNA test.<br />
(to Weir)<br />
It's a match. She is you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know what you're thinking. If she's been waiting in that stasis chamber all these millennia for us to arrive, why didn't the system automatically attempt to revive her the moment we got here? Answer? It did. I've been going over the data from our arrival. One of the first things we noticed was a sudden power surge in the section of the city where the stasis lab was. It was trying to revive her, only we didn't know that. All we saw was more power draining from an already nearly depleted ZPM, so we shut down all secondary systems. I almost killed her.  You. How weird is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Very. Very, very weird. Looking at yourself&#8230;how you will be&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling)<br />
Actually, how you will be, will be different than how she is right now. See, the moment she went back in time she created a separate reality, a second you, living in a&#8212;in a parallel world. According to one of many interpretations of quantum theory. I mean, simply put, this interpretation states that the universe is, in fact, split into an infinite number of copies of itself in which every possible outcome to every decision ever made all exists somewhere in this infinitely layered "multi-universe."</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Simply put.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, in a nutshell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
Elizabeth? There's so much to tell you. The note&#8230;I had a note.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(speaking quickly)<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes. We got your note. And forgive my bluntness, but we really need to know everything about your encounter with the Ancients, beginning at the point where you went back in time. Specifically, how you went back in time, because that would be very useful for us&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney&#8230; Let me talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
There was an accident. I remember, we arrived through the Stargate&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The expedition is arriving through the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
(voice over)<br />
The lights came on by themselves, sensing our presence&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Who's doing that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
(voice over)<br />
The city slowly awoke&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[Crew-members find the Puddle Jumper bay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST<br />
(into radio)<br />
Dr. Weir, you have to see this.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
There are a lot of things I have to see. Just be careful.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard uncover the control stations in the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This must be the control room. This-this is obviously their version of a DHD.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, obviously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This area is probably power control systems, some sort of a computer interface of some kind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why don't you find out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, see, that's the hitch. We've got lights coming on all over the city, air starting to circulate, but no power coming out of these consoles, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><i><b>END FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a minute. Back up a second. That isn't the way it happened. Everything came online when we arrived. It was lights, computers, power control systems, everything. I was able to access the database immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
That's not what happened. Not the first time.</blockquote>
<p>[She falls asleep.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BECKETT'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Isn't there something you can give her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She's in an extremely fragile state. Her blood pressure is low; her heart is very weak. If I administer a stimulant, I'm afraid it may induce a dangerous arrhythmia, or worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm not talking about a strong stimulant, just enough to keep her alert for a few more minutes at a time. We hardly get a couple of words out of her before she dozes off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Which, I might remind you, is not uncommon for a woman of ten thousand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Carson, I understand your reticence, but trust me when I say I believe she can handle it&#8230; And I know she'd want it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(smiling)<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett takes Old Weir's blood pressure. She is sitting up in the bed now.]
</p>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
It's okay, Carson. I'm just as freaked out about all this as you are.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How's our patient doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Pressure's improving, and as you can tell, she's much more alert.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you up for getting out of here?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir brings in Old Weir in a wheel chair. Personnel go about their business as Old Weir looks on.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team and both Weirs have gathered.]
</p>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
Seeing the city like this, sitting on the surface of the ocean. You can't imagine how relieved I am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you saying? The city didn't rise the first time 'round?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
No. No. The city was in serious trouble from the very moment we arrived.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're trying to interface these consoles with a temporary battery power, see if we can access the city's main power systems and get this place up and running.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
(over radio)<br />
Dr. Weir, Colonel Sumner. Can you come down here and meet me, please? We're three levels down from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Right away.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Weir leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How we doing over there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Nothing yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, let's see what we can do, then.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS OBSERVATION ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Weir arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
We've only been able to secure a fraction of the place. It's huge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So it might really be the lost city of Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
I'd say that's a good bet.</blockquote>
<p>[They approach large windows.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Oh, my God. We're underwater.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
I'd say we're under several hundred feet of ocean. This could be a problem.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The console in front of McKay beeps.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Dr. Weir, I need to see you in the control room immediately.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Weir return. McKay has wired a device into an Atlantis console.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The city has a shield, some sort of an energy force field holding the water back. That is, it had a shield. The power systems are nearing maximum entropy. Our arrival hastened their depletion, big time.</blockquote>
<p>[A large display shows flashing red boundaries around the city, and a warning message.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I mean, you can see, the shield is collapsing rapidly. Several sections of the city are already flooded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can we use our own power generators?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I doubt our Naquadah generators can supply enough power to sustain the shield, and we probably don't have time to try. When I say rapidly collapsing, I mean rapidly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sumner, I need you to order all your security teams to stop searching the city and fall back to the gate room immediately. Sumner, do you copy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SUMNER<br />
Dr. Weir, this is Sumner&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Over the radio comes the sounds of crashing glass and water, then nothing but static. Weir and Sheppard are horrified.]

Colonel Sumner drowned?</blockquote>
<blockquote>OLD WEIR<br />
(nodding)<br />
And he wasn't the only one to perish.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We should start evacuating people through the Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can't. Whatever power's left in the system has been diverted to sustaining the shield holding the ocean back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do we know why this is happening now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The shield might've held the water back for another 100 years, but power consumption spiked when we arrived.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is happening because we arrived?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What about auxiliary power?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll try to interface the gate with one of our generators. Hopefully there's enough time. Grodin, access the Stargate control systems, see if you can locate any gate addresses in the database. Won't be nearly enough power to gate back to Earth, but maybe we'll have enough to gate elsewhere in Pegasus.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to work.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Some of our team discovered a bay full of what they're calling ships.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
As in space ships? We should check them out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You think you could figure out&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can fly just about anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good. Go.</blockquote>
