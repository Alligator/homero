<p>When terrifying nightmares about the Wraith haunt Teyla, she visits the city's psychologist and learns that she can sense the Wraith. Determined to discover more, she leads a small team on a mission to a planet from which victims of the Wraith "miraculously" return. There, they uncover what appears to be a genetics laboratory. Could Teyla's connection to the Wraith be the result of genetic experimentation?<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_1.18_%22The_Gift%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 1.18 &quot;The Gift&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

</p><p>[The Wraith enters, raises its hand, and starts to feed on Teyla. She wakes and tries to fight it off. Suddenly it disappears. Teyla wakes from the seeming nightmare, shaken. She rushes out of her quarters.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla rushes through the corridor to the door to Sheppard's quarters.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major Sheppard. Major!</blockquote>
<p>[She activates the controls and enters. Sheppard is covered by blankets. She throws them back, revealing a Sheppard that's been fed upon by Wraith and is now aged and dead. Teyla gasps and turns to face the Wraith.]

</p><p>[Teyla wakens from the nightmare and sits up more slowly. Her skin glistens with sweat.]

</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS EXERCISE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard spar with Athosian fighting sticks. Sheppard gets the best of her after a parry, and they regroup and start again. Sheppard hits Teyla and seems surprised by that.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ah! Continue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Going easy on me, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I assure you, Major, I am not. Continue.</blockquote>
<p>[They spar again. Sheppard throws Teyla to the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure? Because it's usually me picking my butt up off the mat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Truthfully, I have not been sleeping much. And when I do, I've been having nightmares about the Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[He helps her up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you're not the only one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It has not been so bad since my father was taken.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir briefs the staff.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
According to Dr. Zelenka's calculations, we have less than one week before the Wraith arrive. I want options.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You mean besides crying ourselves to sleep? Well, not me. I haven't slept in days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And what do you have to show for your sleepless nights, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Since we got here, we've uncovered a number of defensive weapons systems beyond the shield&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We think our best option is the control chair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I was going to say that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but you were taking too long, as usual.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, but the point is this may not be our best chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Name a better one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Gentlemen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course, like the shield, power will be our biggest problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We haven't even been able to initialize the chair yet, much less determine whether we can meet the power requirements to run it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. Keep me posted. Sergeant Bates, where are we with our Alpha site?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
We've completed the ground and aerial security sweep and are ready to begin establishing base camp. We're just awaiting final inspection by Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right after lunch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good. Teyla, are the Athosians getting prepared for an evacuation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, but many believe there is no other world that is safe from the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They want to stay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
As we have heard from our allies and seen for ourselves, there are cullings happening all over the galaxy. My people have spent their lives hiding from the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, well, the difference here being we do intend to destroy the city rather than let it fall into the hands of the Wraith. And, if it comes to that, anyone left on the mainland will be cut off from the Stargate for good. Now, thanks to Rodney's discovery of the gate's control crystal, we at least know we'll be able to take that with us and hopefully use it to access Earth again some time in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We understand that, Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sorry, I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am merely saying that the people of Athos wish you to know that if we are going to stay and fight, they too will help defend the city of the Ancestors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, that is very honorable, but I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
Oh, please! We can't possibly consider staying and fighting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I disagree. I think it's entirely within the realm of possibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAUGH<br />
There are tens of thousands of life-sucking aliens in highly advanced spaceships on their way here to destroy us and we have what, two hundred people, most of whom are scientists who've never even fired a gun before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Shockingly, for the first time ever, I find myself having to agree with Kavanaugh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All I'm saying is let's not give up&#8230;just yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that we were supposed to all remember? Something important. Oh, yes, that's right&#8212;the Alamo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Granted, you guys are scientists. No one's considering putting you guys on the front line, but science can turn the tide of war. Look at the&#8230;A-bomb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Not exactly our proudest moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The fact is, the Wraith aren't here quite yet, and until that moment, I would like everyone to remain focused on what it is they do best. Like I said off the top, if there are any options, I want them. That's all.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla sits at a table with a tray of food. Heightmeyer approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Kate&#8230;Heightmeyer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Right. I knew that. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
No problem. Mind if I join you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, of course not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Strange how the memory just goes away when we're tired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are a doctor, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Psychologist, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And that is different than Dr. Beckett?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Quite, yes. Um, I deal with the mind. I try and help people deal with emotional problems like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic distress. Well, needless to say, I've been pretty busy since we got here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I can imagine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
I'm sure that you do a lot of the same things that I do for your people, but it must be very hard on you, always having to keep such a brave face.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
From strength comes hope. Without hope, my people would be lost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
You must feel you have to be outwardly strong for us, as well. Teyla, I know that your value and your loyalty have been questioned by a few here in the past. What I'm trying to say to you is if you ever need to talk, I'm here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Did Major Sheppard ask you to speak with me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Yes, he may have&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sorry. I do not mean to be rude, but I'm fine. Really. I appreciate your concern.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GATEROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla finds Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What did you tell Dr. Heightmeyer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Exactly what you told me. That you couldn't sleep because you were having nightmares.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I confided in you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're a member of my team, which makes you my responsibility, And I only told one person, whose job, by the way, is to deal exactly with this sort of thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is nothing wrong with my mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nobody said there was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(angry)<br />
I have a hard enough time getting your people to respect me without them thinking I'm crazy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Nobody thinks you're crazy, and everybody respects you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
That is not the point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, Teyla, you may want to sit this one out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, Rodney's staying back, and Ford and I are just going to check out the Alpha site one last time before we have to move in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Should we evacuate, my people will be forced to that planet as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And I'll make sure it's safe for everyone. Look, Teyla, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with you, God forbid, but you yourself admitted that you were a little off your game. You snapped at Dr. Weir this morning in the briefing room for no good reason. Now you're biting my head off for caring that you might need help dealing with the fact that it's been three days since you've had any sleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sorry, but I do not need any help. The Wraith are coming. What I need is to do something!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Good. I suggest you take a nap.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks into the Gate room. Frustrated, Teyla heads the other way.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TEYLA'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Having taken off her gear, Teyla lies down on her bed. After a moment she sighs and gets up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla comes to Heightmeyer's office. McKay is standing in the doorway.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(surprised)<br />
Dr. McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(uncomfortable)<br />
I was just, um&#8230;<br />
(secretively)<br />
We're seeing each other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You and Dr. Heightmeyer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you know how much I love women with great, um&#8230;minds. Just don't say anything to anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Your secret is safe with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. Very good. Excellent.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Dr. Heightmeyer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Teyla. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm sorry to bother you. Is it all right if I&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Of course. Please, have a seat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I guess I'm not really sure how this is supposed to work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Just relax. Tell me whatever's on your mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have been having bad dreams. I feel&#8230; Everyone on this base is probably afraid. I do not know why I'm bothering you&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[She gets up to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Have you always been able to sense the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes. Since I can remember.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Well, what does it feel like?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sits back down.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It feels like a deep cold that comes from within. I first felt it when I was a girl. I could not breathe, and I did not know why. And then we heard the darts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Do you feel that way now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have had a knot inside me for some time now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
As I understand, though, their ships are still a great distance from Atlantis. Can you really sense them from so far away?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This feeling is a little different than in the past. Perhaps it is because it is always there now. I am getting used to it. Never before in my lifetime have so many Wraith been awake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Do many of your people have this ability?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Some. Among those few, some can sense the Wraith stronger than others. I have always been among the first to know they are coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
That makes you special. How does that make you feel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I do not know. I suppose I have not given it much thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why do some people have blue eyes and others brown?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Tell me about your nightmares.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[A Wraith walks the corridor. It enters Teyla's quarters. It has Teyla's face. Teyla wakes up from the nightmare, in her bed.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It was me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
You were standing over yourself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It was me&#8230;but it was not me. I was a Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
The truth is, people waste a lot of time trying to interpret their dreams. They're really just another way our brain thinks when we're asleep. There are no hidden meanings. In fact, we tend to forget most everything we dream about. Our conscious mind is capable of deciding what's most important to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Well, the fact that, on some level, I see myself as a Wraith is very disturbing to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
I think this special ability you have, this talent for sensing the Wraith, connects you to them in your mind&#8230;maybe in a way you would like to deny. You said you hadn't really given it much thought in the past. I don't think that's true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What am I supposed to do? I cannot change it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Probably not. But the unknown frightens us. We all like to feel in control even though most of the time our power over most things is just an illusion. But I find, the more we know about something, the more we can convince ourselves we are in control of it.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla visits Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I ran every test I could on all of you from the get-go. Physiologically, you and your people are the same as we are. I have no explanation for any of your special super powers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I only have one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've seen you fight, my dear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have previously traced this ability as something that is passed on through family lineage. Does that not make it biological?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It would seem so, but without genetic samples from everyone in your family tree, I would have little to no chance of identifying the specific characteristic that causes the anatomical response.<br />
(off her confusion)<br />
It'd be difficult.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Any chance you would have time to fly me over to the mainland?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
If you're willing to take your life into your own hands. I'd love a break.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ABOVE OCEAN SURFACE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper flies over the ocean.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;MAINLAND VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The village consists of many Earth-built tents in a clearing. There are multiple camp fires burning.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CHARIN'S TENT</b>
</p><p>[Charin serves soup to Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
You've changed, Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My hair is shorter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
It's more than your hair, dear. I can still see the little girl who used to paint me beautiful pictures while she sang the songs of the Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have not been that girl in a long time, Charin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
No, but even Teyla, leader of the Athosians, always found the time to come and visit with poor, old Charin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have missed your tuttleroot soup.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
But I suspect it's more than my soup that has brought you here. You've come to pluck me from my tent and take me to yet another world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Not yet. But it seems we may have to evacuate again soon, at least temporarily.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
Did you allow yourself to expect differently?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I still believe that we can one day be free of the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
You can save such stories for those whose bones aren't failing them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Charin, do you know why I can sense the Wraith coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
You were born to it. There have been a few in every generation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know, but has no one ever wondered how that is possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
Some believe it was a gift from the Ancestors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
Your father asked me not to tell you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My father is not here anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
No other living Athosian knows of this, for good reason.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Please. Tell me anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
My grandfather used to tell a story&#8212;no one has ever heard the like, before or since&#8212;about the few who once returned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Returned?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHARIN<br />
There was a planet&#8230; As was expected, every so often, the Wraith came. Villagers were taken. But there, on this particular planet, on several occasions, the taken came back.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla recounts the story to Weir and Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Some believed that the ancestors had returned their loved ones to them that they had been blessed with a gift that made them unwanted by the Wraith. Others even told tales of how the taken had somehow vanquished the Wraith. But soon, the taken began to be feared.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They spoke of hearing voices. Many began to behave strangely. Some became violent, even murderous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, it doesn't sound like the Ancients were responsible for that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. The villagers turned on the taken. It was a massacre. All but a few were killed. The rest were ostracized sent away. After that, no others that were taken from that village ever returned again. But those few who survived, they are the ones who Charin believes passed on the gift.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And one of the taken that survived was&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My lineage. I have the address to the planet where this happened. Charin says the village is long gone. All that is left are ruins, but still, I wish to go there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe this must be coming to light now for a reason. Maybe we can find evidence of what really happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look, Teyla, there are a lot of things that we need to get done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Maybe there is a way to fight the Wraith that we have yet to discover. Perhaps my ancestors were simply not enlightened enough to recognize their gift for what it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't hurt to take a look around.</blockquote>

Sir, there's nothing here.</blockquote>

I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, it's dark. Shouldn't we be getting back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just give her a minute.</blockquote>
<p>[There is thunder.]

Hey, I thought we weren't going to mention that anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Also interesting is the fact that the Wraith language appears to be a derivative of Ancient, which seems to suggest that the Wraith evolved after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
My theory is that the Ancients unwittingly allowed humans to evolve on a planet with&#8230;insect species on it. At some point, the insects fed on humans and somehow incorporated our DNA into theirs. The Wraith are an evolution of that combination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, at first I thought it was because the other Wraith caught him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They didn't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, according to this, he stopped on his own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See, now you've got me wondering why the rest of the Wraith didn't want these experiments taking place in the first place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Especially since they were supposed to be intended to improve things for everyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I just said it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Will you stop?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, here's the most interesting part. The Wraith communicate with each other using some sort of telepathic network.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I noticed that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thankfully, they can't seem to read the minds of humans, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's good, but what does this have to do with the Wraith stopping the experiments?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Because, by combining even small amounts of Wraith DNA with humans, the scientist was giving the humans Wraith mental abilities. The subjects of his experiments were able to hear the Wraith communications.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In the stories that Teyla told, the voices that the people heard were&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Were Wraith. Exactly. It must have driven them mad. The Wraith scientist couldn't find a way around it, so eventually he gave up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't understand. I mean, why let them back into the general population, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, it seems he thought that interbreeding with normal humans might dilute the effect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Before he realized he was wrong, it was too late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
When the other Wraith did find out what he had done, they wiped out all the people on the planet&#8230; But not before several of the test subjects had already been ostracized and forced to leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, so how does this help us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Teyla may have more than just the ability to sense the Wraith coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? You're saying you think Teyla might be able to&#8230;tap into this Wraith psychic network?</blockquote>

According to the notes all the test subjects who were given the Wraith DNA, they had the ability.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
It's possible it's because you've never actually tried before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You didn't know you could read Wraith minds, and quite frankly, who would want to? Look, Teyla, I would not even consider asking you to do this if I didn't think it could potentially provide us with some vital information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I just do not know what to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, Dr. Heightmeyer has a theory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
I think it's possible that, over time, through several generations people with your ability have developed a mental barrier to the thought projections of the Wraith. Sort of a self-defense mechanism. If we can get past that&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
We have a treatment process called hypnosis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Dr. Heightmeyer can lead you through it and Dr. Beckett will remain on hand at all times to monitor your physiology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith are still very far away, are they not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, they are, and McKay, he does have some doubts about the range of this telepathy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DR. HEIGHTMEYER<br />
But as you've said, you can sense the Wraith now. If that's merely a bleed-through effect into your consciousness of a greater latent ability, then it may be worth trying to break the barrier. To be perfectly honest, it's not something I would ever recommend doing under any other circumstances.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
