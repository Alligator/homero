<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;HOFFAN CITY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The early industrial city is beside a river, smokestacks are active all around. A Puddle Jumper is parked beside a large building with a dome. There is a crater with the remains of a ruined building nearby.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Hoffan Chancellor Druhin leads the Atlantis team on a tour of the facility.]
</p>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Reliable power generation is one of our greatest concerns. With this project, we hope, soon, to be able to convert and utilize the intense heat trapped beneath the surface of our planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Geothermal energy.</blockquote>
<p>[They arrive at a room full of machinery.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, using this? Do you have any idea how complex geothermal energy is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sure it'll work like a charm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like you're&#8230;accomplishing great things here, Chancellor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Since the last Wraith culling, we have worked diligently to rebuild our society.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you not concerned that your efforts will attract the attention of the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Yes, but we refuse to let that stop us from striving to reach our potential. To do otherwise would simply mean victory for them. However, we currently, are working on a viable defense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(suddenly very interested)<br />
Defense? Really? We've been here for two days before you mention that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
I had to learn that you could be trusted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Are you talking about some sort of defensive weapon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
You could call it that. Something that we hope will protect us from the next Wraith culling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So you are expecting it to happen again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Of course. But if the Wraith return as they have historically, they won't be here for least another fifty years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking sideways at Sheppard)<br />
Fifty years you say?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How about that weapon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Yes, yes. If you'll just come this way.</blockquote>
<p>[Druhin leads Ford and Teyla away; Sheppard and McKay stay behind to talk privately.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You haven't told him that we practically woke the Wraith from hibernation, have you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, I have&#8212; I haven't really had the chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've been here two days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One and a half, really.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to follow the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Major, they're not expecting the Wraith for another 50 years. We have to let them know they could show up at any time now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If you're so eager, why don't you tell them?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN RESEARCH FACILITY</b>
</p><p>[The team is touring the facility.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Reminds you of Area 51, doesn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Circa 1918.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't think Area 51 was around in 1918, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the area was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
True.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't think there's a hope in hell these people could have a weapon that&#8212; Weapons come in all shapes, and sizes, Lieutenant.</blockquote>
<p>[They enter a room where a scientist is working with chemicals.]
</p>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Major Sheppard, I think you'll find this intriguing.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds up a corked test tube containing a red liquid. Sheppard takes it from him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. I'm intrigued. What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Something that we hope will one day make us completely immune to the Wraith.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The team briefs Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
According to Chancellor Druhin, their drug is still several years away from being finished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Iâ€™d say given their current level of technology, that could be an understatement. Just because they believe they're close to a breakthrough doesn't mean that they are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You saw for yourself that their entire civilization is based upon the completion of that goal, Dr. McKay. I would not underestimate them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do we even know for certain that the Wraith are an immediate threat?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We can probably bet they don't have 50 years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hence, Major Sheppard has generously offered our help to the Hoffans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(surprised)<br />
Has he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(defensively)<br />
Look. The fact is, if they're on to something, maybe we could speed up the process.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, Major, you have a go, but if the drug really is, just a pipe dream&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dr. Beckett's already volunteered to help us find that out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(skeptical)<br />
Oh, he has, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He will.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE TRAVEL</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and Sheppard's team walk briskly down the hallway.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's not that I mind lending people a hand&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, of course not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're a generous man, Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But it's the principle of the thing, isn't it? You can't go around volunteering someone for something without consulting them first. That's not even volunteering, is it? It's being pressed into service. Not to mention the fact that I'm not&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not military. I can't give you orders, I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, no, no. He just doesn't like going through the Stargate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's worse than Dr. McCoy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The TV character that Dr. Beckett plays in real life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Converting the human body into energy and sending it millions of light years through a wormhole&#8230;bloody insanity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on, how often do you get to travel to an alien planet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I was already on an alien planet.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[Beckett has brought his more modern equipment to the lab. Beckett picks up a tray of Hoffan test tubes filled with different colored liquids.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Should you be messing with that stuff?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know what I'm doing, Major. Thank you. From the looks of things, they've mastered a few basics&#8212;biochemistry, physiology, perhaps even some form of molecular biology. Fairly impressive, considering&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[A pretty woman enters and answers.]
</p>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
It is our people's legacy. This room represents hundreds of years of medical knowledge. I am Perna, Chief Scientist for the project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
John Sheppard. Oh, and this is Teyla and Lieutenant Ford&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(somewhat smitten)<br />
Carson. Beckett. Doctor. I mean, call me Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm Dr. McKay. Dr. Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[He reaches his hand out, but she doesn't take it. He lowers it awkwardly.]
</p>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
I hope you will find our facilities suitable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(smiling flirtatiously)<br />
Oh, they're charming, perfectly charming.</blockquote>
<p>[The team leaves Beckett and Ford with Perna.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Druhin leads the Sheppard, McKay, and Teyla down the hallway.]
</p>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Long ago, this city was once a testament to our imagination, our creative spirit, to endless possibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How long ago was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
It is true that we have been forced to rebuild many times and never to our potential. That is why perfecting the drug is so important. It is more than just a defense against the Wraith. It is our future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
With respect, Chancellor, you cannot prevent the culling. It is a fact of existence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
A fact we challenge. We will always search for a way to end the cycle of destruction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith will always prevent any race from advancing too far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You figure you can beat them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Yes. Through knowledge.</blockquote>
<p>[He has led them to a large metal door. A guard opens it. Inside is a huge chamber full of books. Sheppard and the other approach slowly, clearly amazed.]
</p>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
A number of archives like this one are hidden throughout the city. Their existence is known only to a few.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is&#8230;very impressive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
We meticulously preserve the accomplishments of each generation before they are wiped out by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So everything your people ever learned is in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
And in other archives identical to this one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In case they destroy one. You guys are serious about this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Standing on the shoulders of our forefathers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How long have you been working on this Wraith drug?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
One hundred and fifty years ago, our scientists were close to creating a viable prototype, only to die before seeing its fruition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So you're hoping that if this world's no good to them, they're just gonna move on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
The Wraith cannot possibly perceive us as a threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
To tell you the truth, I don't know how they would react.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If they choose to wipe you out of existence, you will be helpless.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
We cannot hope to control their actions. We can only do what we can to end the cycle that has gone on for far too long.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[Perna takes down a book from a shelf and brings it to Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
His name was Farrol Mylan. Before he died in the last culling, he was one of our most celebrated medical researchers. He was the one who found it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Found what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
The key. His journals tell of one man who survived an encounter with the Wraith. Farrol and his team discovered that this man possessed a unique protein, one that enabled him to resist the chemical released by the Wraith to precipitate draining of life from their victims. After painstaking trial and error&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Farrol made a copy of the protein.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
He was eventually able to create a prototype of a drug designed to interfere with the Wraith feeding process.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And it worked?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
Farrol was killed before the drug could be used to defend Hoff.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And it's been your job to make certain his work wasn't in vain. Quite the responsibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
It is a great honor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How do you know for certain that this Farrol&#8230;wasn't just embellishing his results, or for that matter, making them up? I mean, all you have to go on are his notes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
He and his team worked until the last possible moment. They knew the Wraith ships were overhead, and still they worked through the night, hoping to provide one more insight, one last thread of knowledge. Not for themselves, but for the generation that would survive. Ten thousand soldiers gave their lives to give them those last few hours. The last words of Farrol's journal are known to all Hoffans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I meant no disrespect, Perna.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
It's all right. More than just his journals survived the culling. His research materials were safeguarded as well, including carefully preserved Wraith cell samples which we still use in our work today. Please. See for yourself.</blockquote>
<p>[She shows him to a microscope with a slide next to it. He puts the slide under the lens and looks through it reluctantly.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Whoa. That's incredible&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Perna smiles.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and Weir walk down the stairs then leave the gate room.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I saw it with my own eyes, Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, in a petri dish. And we are talking about 150-year-old Wraith cells. I mean, for all we know, they could be immune to the drug by now, or come up with defenses against it&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't think so, Doctor. I took the liberty of running a few tests of my own, using cells taken from the Wraith arm Major Sheppard brought back from Athos. The results were the same&#8212;near complete resistance. They've definitely got something. Believe me, I'm more surprised than anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So, what do you recommend?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That we take their work to the next level. I've informed the Hoffans of our guest in the brig.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You realize what you're asking for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I do.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith prisoner is inside the cell. Bates stands outside the bars, guarding him. Sheppard arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Anything I should know about, Sergeant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
No, sir. He's been quiet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's still trying to make you see things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
He's given up on that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I didn't think he'd last this long.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard approaches the cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Hello again, Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry if I woke you. Just came by to see if there's anything you needed. Magazine, fresh towels&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
You hide your fear poorly, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, we've been having these conversations for a couple of weeks now, and I don't even know your name. You guys do have names, right? Let me guess. Steve?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
I am your death. That is all you need to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I prefer "Steve".</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
What do you hope to gain from this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just trying to bridge the gap between our two cultures, get to know you better. That, and try to figure out how to keep your kind from sucking the life out of millions of innocent people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Even if I told you what you wanted to know, it would change nothing. You are doomed, as are any humans that stand in our way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can't be a nice way to die. Hungry, slow&#8230; knowing your food source is just out of reach&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Furious, the Wraith strikes at the cell force field, then retreats.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
(shouting)<br />
Why do you keep me here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I need to know what we're up against. For example, how many of those big hive ships, have you got, and where are they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
You have nothing to offer me in return.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We could talk about easing your hunger, Steve.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
You would never sacrifice one of your own kind. And yet, it is all that stands between you and the information you seek.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at him.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett briefs Sheppard, McKay, Teyla, and Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Using living Wraith cells is our only recourse at this juncture. Without them, we have no way of knowing for certain if the drug is actually viable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You said it worked effectively on the cells of the severed Wraith arm we brought back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It did, but those were already in a partially decayed state. We need live samples.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And with new samples, you think it's possible to create a prototype?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Given enough time, yes, I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's got a good point. The Hoffans are practically obsessed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I agree, Doctor, but their obsession may become their undoing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, even if they do&#8230;undo, it'd be good for us. I mean, given the choice, wouldn't you want to be immune?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Not if it meant the lives the Wraith might otherwise spare. This drug would only&#8230; be of value if everyone, everywhere, possessed the same immunity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's a thought worth pursuing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I agree. Major, have you made any progress with your prisoner?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, not yet, but he just blinked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He blinked? What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It means he's still holding on, but he's indicated to me that he may break soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And he indicated this to you by blinking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No offense, Major, but so far, he hasn't told you a thing. For all we know, he could linger this way for months, and, ultimately, we'll learn nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith could be on their way to Hoff, as we speak. If your prisoner holds the key to the creation of this drug, should we not take advantage of this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How could we get the sample off him, safely?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We still possess the weapons used in his capture. It would be a simple matter of incapacitating him again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So then it's possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's possible.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p><p>[Steve kneels on the cell floor, his back to the door. Sheppard and Ford open the door and enter. Bates, Beckett, and others wait outside. The guards have their weapons drawn.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi, Steve.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Bye, Steve.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith gets up, turns around and attacks them with a growl. Ford shoots him with a Wraith stunner. It keeps coming, so Ford shoots him again. He falls unconscious. Ford, Sheppard, and Bates approach him, weapons drawn.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Is he&#8230; I mean, you're certain he's&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
He's down, Doc. Do your thing.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sighs and approaches.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Almost looks peaceful, doesn't he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Peaceful? Are you out of your bloody mind?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;HOFFAN CITY, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HOFFAN RESEARCH LAB</b>
</p><p>[Beckett connects his laptop to an Earth microscope so that it shows the output. He has brought a big case of samples, which Perna examines excitedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
I have never seen devices such as these.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(looking through microscope)<br />
The work you've done refining the drug has been good up till now. With all this&#8230; we can make it better. From what I can tell, your biggest problem is that the test inoculations failed to show enough of a presence in human cells to be effective.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
What we need is a better delivery system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Exactly, and the best place to start is to recreate the key protein in the serum and work our way up from there. If we can avoid having to re-engineer it from a natural source and make an entirely synthetic version, it should ultimately increase the efficiency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
Such a thing is possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Anything's possible, if you're willing to give it a go. Come on then, a bald head is soon shaved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
You speak differently than the others.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You noticed that, did you? Sorry if I confuse you. Trust me, where I come from, it all makes perfect sense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
What is it like?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Scotland? Oh, I think it's beautiful, but I'm told it's something of an acquired taste.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
I meant your world. It must be so peaceful there, knowing that the Wraith will not come.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, you'd be surprised how not peaceful it is. We're spoiled rotten, now that I think of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
Oh, you miss it. I'm sorry for inquiring.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, no, no. Don't be, love.</blockquote>
<p>[They work in the lab while Sheppard watches Steve get weaker in his cell. Night falls outside the lab on Hoff. The Wraith gets every weaker.]
</p>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />
(reading from Mylan's notes)<br />
One can see the various refraction chambers required to complete the preliminary stage of fluctuation required to boil down the base material&#8230;</blockquote>

</p><p>[It is the next day, or later. Beckett looks intently at the microscope read-out.]

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Perna.</blockquote>
<p>[She joins him and looks, then turns to him in amazement. They smile and hug each other joyfully.]
</p><p>[Later Druhin has joined them.]
</p>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
One hundred percent cellular penetration in all five test inoculations. Incredible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There's still a lot of data to be analyzed, but the initial results are very promising, I agree.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PERNA<br />

I've already done a series of tests you might like to know the results of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know what killed him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm going to go out on a limb here, and say that it was all of his vital organs shutting down almost simultaneously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Did he starve to death?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No. Based on the condition his body's in, I don't think he died from a lack of nourishment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, then what was it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Initial tests revealed a significant amount of Hoffan serum in his blood stream. I'm guessing we'll find similar trace amounts in each of his organs once we analyze those as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why did the Hoffan drug end up in <i>his</i> blood?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
From the Hoffan's research, we know that when the Wraith feed, they release a chemical into their victims' bodies. What it actually does, we don't yet understand, but I can only assume that it prepares the human body in some way to be drained of life. The serum is designed to shield the victim from that initial chemical release, blocking it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I think the serum protein may have mutated, when it was exposed to the Wraith chemical, triggering some sort of toxic reaction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So instead of feeding off of him&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He was poisoned. So, if the serum did this, then it's more than just a defense against the Wraith.</blockquote>

It kills them.</blockquote>

No, it just takes away any doubt about what the Wraith will do when they eventually come here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
I fail to see the difference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Once they learn you possess a weapon such as this, the Wraith will wipe your people from existence, in retaliation for the Wraith deaths.</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
Or they may simply leave us alone once they learn we are&#8230;unpalatable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because they're such an easygoing, live-and-let-live kind of race. You know, maybe there was half a chance at that, when we were talking about this being defensive, but now&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>DRUHIN<br />
You fail to see the larger picture, Major. For the first time, we have a way to not just defend ourselves, but to strike back.</blockquote>
