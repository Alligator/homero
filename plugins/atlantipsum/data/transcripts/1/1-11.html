<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is yelling for Kolya not to kill Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Kolya! Kolya don't do this!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Kolya points his gun at Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How is this going to help you get what you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Sheppard put you in this position, not me.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay steps in front of Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pleading)<br />
You can't do this. This is crazy. You need her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
She's right, Commander.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I’m not kidding. There are codes required to activate the shield, codes that only she knows. You can't do it without her.<br />
(realizing Kolya might kill him instead)<br />
Well, you can't do this without me either. I mean, we're a package deal. I mean, you take us out of the equation, and you don't have an end game. Granted, that's a chess term. My point is, we're the only ones who can fix the grounding station.<br />
(voice increasing until he's shouting)<br />
We're the only ones who can activate the shield. We're the only ones that can solve problems I can’t even think of yet. You kill either one of us, and you don't get what you want! That's how important we are. It's impor&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney. Rodney, he gets it.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya lowers his gun and walks away. McKay grabs his arm as if remembering the pain and that it is bleeding.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Sora)<br />
I appreciate&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
You're an asset we need to complete this mission.</blockquote>
<p>[She storms off.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You stepped in front of a gun for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't thank me just yet. We've got two and a half hours till the storm hits, and unless our luck changes drastically, this city is going to be obliterated.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya rests against a console and picks up a Genii radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major Sheppard, how's this for credibility? Weir is dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I am going to kill you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Maybe. Stay out of my way, or McKay will join her.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard huffs in frustration and lowers the Genii wrist radio. Off the balcony, the storm approaches and it grows dark. Sheppard runs back into Atlantis.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The city is being beaten by waves and rain.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[In the rear part of the gate control room, Ladon uses an Atlantis laptop and the large display to find Sheppard in the city. He is several levels below the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
This is amazing. There you are.<br />
(to soldier)<br />
We're here. Take two men, head there. Four levels down. That's Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER<br />
(to other soldiers)<br />
Yes, sir. Let's go. You're with me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
(to Sora)<br />
He's heading out of the hallways.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS NEAR STAIRWAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard descends the stairway, his machine gun drawn and ready to fire.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS MAINLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper is still being deluged with rain and lightening.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The jumper is shaking. A huge tree falls to the ground just in front of them.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Holy&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right. That's it!</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to manipulate the Jumper controls.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What are you doing, man?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Adding weight to the Puddle jumper by resetting its inertial dampeners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You shouldn't screw with those controls. We're heavy enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Can't be too careful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, you can. You can be way too careful. There's no chance we're going to blow away here. Let it go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That should be enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How much longer until the storm passes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I guess we're barely halfway through, but there's no way to tell.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla gives him a worried look.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I know. I hope they're okay, too.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard makes his way into a room with a circular platform, then goes down some steps, using his life-signs detector to guide him. After a moment, he runs off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The sun breaks through, and the rain stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's this then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We're through it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We can't be. It's not possible.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard examines the LSD and uses it to guide his movements. He stops at a corner and looks at his watch, then at the LSD again, then keeps going.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
He's moving.</blockquote>
<p>[The large display shows Sheppard moving one direction and three others, Genii, moving the opposite direction in the corridor next to Sheppard's.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard takes a position where he can overhear the soldiers talking on the walkway level just below him.]
</p>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER<br />
Are you sure we're on the right level?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER<br />
(over radio)<br />
Where did he go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Shh. He can probably hear your stupid questions.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard activates and sets down some smoke canisters.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ladon and Sora look in frustration as Sheppard's life-sign moves away from the soldiers'.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay leads Weir and Kolya to the grounding station Sheppard was at last. It's raining hard there, and they all get soaking wet immediately. McKay examines the station.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, will you look at this? Now, that is just&#8230; That is just never going to be useful again.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls a cover off, revealing fiber optic cables.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I should be able to bypass this switching station entirely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Good. How long?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not half as bad as it looks. I'd say fifteen, twenty minutes tops.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dr. Weir, I need you to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Right, of course.</blockquote>
<p>[She kneels beside him and shines the flashlight.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Keep that there.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard makes his way back to a room. He looks at his watch and the LSD again, then sets out another smoke canister and leaves. Smoke starts to fill the room.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS MAINLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ford, Teyla, and Beckett walk down the back ramp of the Jumper. The weather is calm, the sun shining. There are large clouds around them.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We're in the eye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Right. Has to be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The eye?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Dead center of the storm. The storm swirls around a twenty- to forty-kilometer-wide area.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then this calm will not last?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, in fact, in about ten minutes, it's going to get very ugly again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, come on. We have to help the Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, we can take off but landing's twice as hard, believe me. What if the storm's reached Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Has it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Not just yet, but it will anytime now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Stop wasting time. Let's go. Let's hit it. Let’s go.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford pushes Beckett into the Jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Beckett sits in the pilot seat.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We still have to fly straight through the storm, Lieutenant. It's insanity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
This is not insanity. This is a spaceship. We can fly up and over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(incredulous)<br />
Straight up and down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Straight up and down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm a bloody medical doctor, not a magician!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You can do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If we can help, we must.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh! Oh, crap.</blockquote>
<p>[He turns to the controls.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
(watching the display of life-signs)<br />
Twenty feet away.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[The Genii soldiers make their way to the room Sheppard was last in, but the air is smoky.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The display shows the soldiers to be nearly beside Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Five feet.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER<br />
There's so much smoke. Which way?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
You're right on top of him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GENII SOLDIER<br />
Yeah? I think I would see him if I was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Stand by.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is poised on the catwalk above the soldiers. He uses his laser site to aim at them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ladon and Sora hear gunfire.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
Do you see him? Did you get him? Report.</blockquote>
<p>[The life-signs blink out on the display until there is only one remaining. Laden lowers his head in sorrow.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Commander.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, Sora.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
Ladon has been leading three of our men on a reconnaissance mission. It seems Major Sheppard has killed three more of our strike team.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Tell everyone to move back to the control room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
Right away, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya turns away, leaving McKay and Weir able to talk.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Why did you tell him you could have this fixed in fifteen to twenty minutes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I don't know. Maybe so he wouldn't kill us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I understand that, but once the shield is operational, we won't be very useful, now, will we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why did you let me tell him I could fix it in fifteen or twenty?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You just have to stall him some more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I just told him how long it'll take.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Find another problem with it. Tell them that the power loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout, something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"Isn't jiving"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, you get my point. Though from the sounds of it, if we can buy Sheppard enough time, it seems like he can take care of the rest of them on his own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Radio Chief Cowen. Tell him to send reinforcements. A full company.
(to Weir)<br />
If you're hoping Major Sheppard can diminish our numbers, you are mistaken.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard comes to a halt.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. What would McKay do?</blockquote>
<p>[He gets and idea and runs off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ABOVE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper is making a steep descent to the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Beckett is struggling to fly the craft.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Uh, you're coming in a little steep, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm very aware of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I told you not to play with the inertial dampeners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm pretty sure I got them back where they were. Why don't you try to contact the major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
First, you got to get us in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(fighting the controls)<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS </b>
</p><p>[Near tubes filled with colored liquid and a stack of metal trunks, Sheppard sees a hand-painted sign that says "Really Really Dangerous &#8212; Don't Touch &#8212; McKay". He grimaces. He is standing next to a naquadah generator.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ladon and Sora see that Sheppard is near a power source.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
(rhetorically)<br />
What are you up to?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS </b>
</p><p>[Sheppard lifts the control on the generator, de-activating it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The power goes out. Ladon and Sora turn on flashlights.]
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
What's he done now?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS </b>
</p><p>[Sheppard moves away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
I should have seen this coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Commander. Major Sheppard has cut power to the control room.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
How?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the control room and the grounding station.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
(into radio, investigating the various control consoles as he speaks)<br />
It looks like Atlantis is being powered by five small generators, each responsible for a separate area of the city. Major Sheppard has just disabled the one generator that powers Stargate operations in this tower. Now, we still have most primary operations. We have definitely lost all secondary systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Can you still track Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
And we have no idea where he is now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
No, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters a transporter station. He is able to overhear the Genii conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Is the control room secure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, Commander. I suggest we send some men to guard the remaining generators.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard exits the transporter on a higher level. He takes a deep breath and moves out, using his LSD, his machine gun ready.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
No! He's trying to divide us into manageable numbers. Just hold Stargate operations until the reinforcements arrive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard keeps advancing.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Weir)<br />
If he asks what's taking so long, you have to do all the talking, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, I won't. I'm a terrible bluffer. I've lost small fortunes at poker. My eye twitches. I laugh inappropriately. It's not pretty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
What's our progress?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We've hit a small snag. We're just running a diagnosis to make sure we can interface our codes properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a small snag, small snag. It's, like, half an hour at the most.</blockquote>
<p>[The power around their area goes out.]
</p>
<blockquote>LADON<br />
(over radio)<br />
Commander Sheppard has just disabled another generator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, Ladon I’m aware of that. He's cut the power to grounding station three.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Can it still be repaired?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at dead connectors)<br />
Without power? No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Can the plan be completed without it? The other three grounding stations have been disabled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, it's just not good enough. Look, by uncoupling the grounding stations, it means that when lightning strikes the city, the electricity will have nowhere to go. Now, if we can channel the electricity properly through the conduits that line the city corridors, we should be able to power the shield&#8230;temporarily. If any of these grounding stations are left active, a sizable amount of electricity will find its way to ground and no shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The storm is deluging the city, and causing near darkness.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(starting to panic, into radio)<br />
Commander, the storm has not slowed its pace. We have little time to get the shields activated. We should re-evaluate our goal. Perhaps&#8212;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
We still have more than enough time to complete our objectives.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the control room and the grounding station.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Then I must strongly advise that we send men down to repair the deactivated generators and to guard the remaining active ones.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Agreed, teams of two but I want you to watch over the control room. As soon as the reinforcements arrive have them take Sheppard with overwhelming force.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GROUNDING STATION, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Perhaps we can be under shelter while we wait. I'm liable to catch a cold like that&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Kolya just stares at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I take it that's a "no"?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER BAY</b>
</p><p>[The jumper has landed. Ford and Teyla check the surroundings, and Ford gets a second machine gun. One of the Athosians rushes out, but Teyla bars his way.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Remain here and be still. I will return for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Armory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Are you sure that’s what we should be&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You know you're always saying you're not military, you don't have to take orders?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(handing Beckett the gun)<br />
Now you do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
So long as it's temporary.</blockquote>
<p>[The move out then pause.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Should we try and contact the Major now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Genii may be monitoring our frequencies. We do not want to alert them of our presence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Life-signs detector.</blockquote>
<p>[He hands one to Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
These wee dots don't tell us much about who's who. How do we know which one's the Major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
He'll be the dot getting rid of the other dots.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ENTRANCE TO GENERATOR ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Two Genii guard the entrance to a room with a naquadah generator. Elsewhere, two more soldiers do the same.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS OCEAN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
How many should we expect?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LADON<br />

Are you really going to sacrifice the lives of all of your men on the off-chance that this city won't be completely destroyed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(to his men)<br />
Open the Stargate. Start evacuating the remaining men.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're making the right decision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You're coming with us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You'll both serve the Genii as payment for what you've done.</blockquote>
<p>[Soldiers grab McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, for what we've done?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla throws Sora into some crates, then flips her to the ground.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Genii soldiers carry the supplies they have taken through the Stargate. Sheppard and Ford watch.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ford)<br />
Change of plan.</blockquote>
<p>[The move around to a different position with a sight on the stairway.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You got McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is being herded down the stairs and to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously, this is a bad idea. You saw what happened to my last plan. This is not what&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ford start firing, shooting the soldiers. McKay gets away from the Genii. Ladon goes through the 'gate. Kolya grabs Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're not going anywhere&#8230;. I will shoot you if you don't let her go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
And risk hurting Dr. Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not aiming at her.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard fires a single shot and hits Kolya in the chest, sending him backward through the 'gate. Weir falls to the floor, then gets up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ford)<br />
Find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure that's all of them.</blockquote>
<p>[He rushes up to Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry about that. I had to&#8230; You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You will be. Come on.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs her hand and drags her up the stairs toward the control room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay goes to his console.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Wait! What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I thought I'd activate the shield and save the day. You got something else in mind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Teyla and Beckett are still out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Tracking system's down. There's a tsunami headed towards the city, Lieutenant. In two and a half minutes, they're dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then give them two minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay sighs in frustration at the situation.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LOWER LEVELS</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sora fight. With the upper hand, Teyla drops her knife on purpose. She attacks with no weapon and turns Sora's knife against her, pinning Sora to the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This is not what your father would have wanted. Our people were destined to be allies&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Teyla and Beckett, fall back to the control room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
This must end now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SORA<br />
Then end it.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla takes Sora's knife and throws it to the floor, then runs out, leaving Sora standing alone. After a moment, she follows, leaving her knife behind.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no more time. We either lose them, or we lose the city.</blockquote>
<p>[Sora and Teyla enter, supporting Beckett between them.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Going!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Lightening starts hitting the city strongly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDORS</b>
</p><p>[The lightening travels down corridors all over the city, doing some damage.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A huge wall of water approaches the city.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What's happening?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MACKAY<br />
It’s working. It just needs to build up enough power for the shield to activate. Wait for it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(in greeting)<br />
Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just in time to see how this ends, huh?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The wall of water nearly reaches the city. It is much higher than the highest towers.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pushing a button)<br />
Now.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY OF ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The shield rises just as the wave reaches the city. It dissipates the force of the water.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Nice work, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did you ever doubt me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, several times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CITY OF ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p>[The skies are clearing as the sun sets (or rises).]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The 'gate is active. Athosians and Atlantis personnel come through with their supplies. Sheppard and Weir watch from the control room balcony.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you want to do with her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't know yet. We'll keep her locked up for the time being. Maybe releasing her back to the Genii would help ease tension between us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're extremely optimistic. You know that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You think so?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay arrives. He has a bandage around his forearm, on the outside of his jacket.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everyone getting back okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How fares our city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we've begun pumping out the lower levels of the East Pier, which was flooded. There is structural damage, nothing too serious. Beckett's suffered from a minor concussion. Hasn't been able to look at this. I had to do this myself.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rolls his eyes at McKay's injury.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Still, on the bright side I've had my first decent meal in twenty-four hours, so all things considered, I would say we are just fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They say these things happen every twenty years, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's what they tell us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How far in advance can we book days off?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay smiles weakly, and they all walk back into the control room.]
