<p>The Atlantis team visits a pre-technological paradise and requests that they be allowed to bring refugees of Wraith attacks there for sanctuary. The locals refuse, believing that the goddess Athar has restricted their planet from colonization by outsiders. But when Sheppard invites Athar's priestess back to Atlantis, is he inviting trouble into their midst?<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_1.14_%22Sanctuary%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 1.14 &quot;Sanctuary&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[A Puddle Jumper speeds around the planet. Wraith darts pursue the craft.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard flies the Jumper, the rest of the team with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I count two. How about you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, sir. I recommend shooting back any time now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm trying. That hit must've caused some damage. McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm on it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gets up to work on the panels in the aft of the Jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where did they come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's right. The darts are short-range fighters. There's probably a hive ship around here somewhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then we need to get out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
The Stargate is the other way, sir, on the other side of the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we're taking the scenic route. McKay!</blockquote>
<p>[The Jumper fires weapons forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm almost there!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
There's one on our tail!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you, I know all about that one. Keep your eye on the other one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, you should have weapons now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Negative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Positive!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm pretty sure I fixed it.</blockquote>
<p>[A dart flies past the Jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, obviously you didn't!</blockquote>
<p>[The Jumper is hit by a dart weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps we can lose them in the atmosphere of the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Two more darts on our two o'clock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I see them. McKay!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not like I'm holding back on you.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[A huge ball of light energy emits from the planet and envelops and destroys the darts behind the Jumper. It begins to follow the Jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hang on!</blockquote>
<p>[The energy passes over the Jumper, jolting but not damaging it.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[The energy ball moves away.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith darts have been destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's a good thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(walking forward, breathless)<br />
I thought for sure we were dead. Didn't you think we were dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Some sort of uh, energy weapon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you say we find out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper de-orbits toward the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So just to confirm, we're all still&#8230;definitely not dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I feel very much alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good. Same here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I wish I knew what that was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Looked like lightning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Space lightning?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I already said, it's some sort of an energy weapon, one that apparently destroys Wraith darts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Nice, but why them and not us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well assuming that we're still alive, and there doesn't appear to be any damage as a result of the pulse, I think we can safely conclude that, uh&#8230; um&#8230; um&#8230; I got nothing. I mean, I got nothing to conclude. I'm just talking for the sake of talking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You sure you're okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You know how much I hate certain death?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Could something like that be naturally occurring?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My money's on non-naturally occurring.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Like a weapon the Ancients left behind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any weapon that impressive would have to be powered by&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A Zero-Point Module.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, we need to get down there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've got to put down and check for damage anyways, before we head back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper skims along above trees and a creek.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OUTSIDE VILLAGE ON PROCULIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ford looks at a primitive village through binoculars. The huts are made of wood and straw, with no sign of technology. Several children are visible.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
If there is a weapon somewhere down here, sir, these folks didn't build it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not these kids. You picking up anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm picking up everything, just nothing worth mentioning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
These folks look familiar to you, Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Stargate is in orbit, Major. My people could never have ventured here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. What say we venture?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE ON PROCULIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The villagers are young and fit, dressed in tropical, tribal clothing, with bone necklaces and tattoos. Sheppard and the team approach cautiously, and people turn to look at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi.</blockquote>
<p>[One villager, dressed in a red robe, runs toward a structure. Sheppard speaks to the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's okay. We're friendly. Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is likely they have never seen anyone from outside their village.</blockquote>
<p>[As the walk to the center, the villagers follow them, curious. An older man in a red robe comes out of the structure where the first man had gone.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Welcome. I am Zarah, one of the Abbots of Proculis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm John. John Sheppard. This is Teyla, Lieutenant Ford, and Dr. McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Please, come.</blockquote>
<p>[He ushers them to a thatched hut. The kneel around a low table.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
This is the first time&#8212;at least in my own lifetime&#8212;that people from another land have come to us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we came by ship. A flying&#8230;thing that allows us to move from one world to another.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
(shocked)<br />
Another world?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
From among the stars you see in the night sky. We are peaceful explorers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Then glory to Athar for bringing you here safely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Athar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
The provider&#8230;and protector of all. Surely you know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Athar is known by many names among the stars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is, um&#8230;Athar around? We'd love to talk to him. We're, uh, friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Athar is friend to all, and with us always. Even now.</blockquote>
<p>[He closes his eyes and presses his hands together.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course. Hi, Athar.</blockquote>
<p>[Zarah looks at McKay in confusion.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What Dr. McKay means is that we wish to offer our thanks. We were attacked by the Wraith and would have been killed, were it not for Athar's intervention.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
"Wraith"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Pale skin, sunken eyes, suck the life out of you with their hands?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
We have never encountered such beings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Never?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And there is no mention of them in your history?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
None. I can assure you that for many thousands of years, we have lived here in peace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Could you excuse us for a moment?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to get up, but Zarah interrupts.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Of course. Please, I must tell the other abbots of your arrival before we go to meet with Chaya.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Chaya is&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
The high priestess of Athar. This is a great day for our people.</blockquote>
<p>[Zarah leaves. Many villagers look into the hut.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ours too.<br />
(to the team)<br />
I'm not kidding. This could really work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I agree, Major. Every inhabited world I have encountered in this galaxy has been ravaged by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, this planet is protected by an Ancient weapon. This just confirms it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Does it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, there's no other explanation. I mean, the power requirements of something like that must be astronomical. Only a ZPM could generate that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And yet, they do not appear to be technologically advanced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Unless that guy was lying. But he doesn't seem like the lying type.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, automated defenses?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Imagine a world where displaced refugees from dozens of planets could come and live in peace without fear of being culled by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Maybe we can negotiate some kind of treaty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We just need access to that weapon&#8212;better still, the ZPM&#8212;not that we'd steal it or anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's just try to stay on our best behavior.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm always on my best behavior.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PROCULIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team walk across an open field, escorted by three abbots.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How much farther?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Not very.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, good. See, we could have taken the jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
The exercise is good for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Chaya does live pretty far from your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is not uncommon, Major, for clerics to live apart from the community.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;CHAYA'S TEMPLE</b>
</p><p>[A beautiful woman, Chaya tends plants in her courtyard. The abbots and Sheppard's team arrive. Chaya approaches them.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Glory to Athar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Welcome, and rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
Thank you, sister.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is open-mouthed in shock at seeing Chaya.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
You are new to Proculis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes. We're, uh&#8230;we're brand new, in fact. Major John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[He shakes her hand. McKay gives Ford a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I am called Chaya Sar. And you are&#8230;Teyla, Lieutenant Ford and Dr. McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How did she know that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, please. One of the abbots ran ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a pleasure to meet you, Chaya.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
You must be tired after your long journey. Shall I prepare some tea for us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I was hoping you were going to say just that.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, they all share tea, seated around a table in the courtyard.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
And where do they come from, these Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They seem to be everywhere in this galaxy, and they appear to have been on top of the food chain for a long time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
It's terrifying. Truly terrifying. My heart goes out to your people, Teyla.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is not only my people who suffer, Chaya. The Wraith have awakened from a long sleep, and this entire world is safe from the culling that has already begun. Even Atlantis with all its wonder, may not survive the onslaught. It is our hope that Athar could grant sanctuary here on Proculis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Sanctuary? For so many?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we're not talking about everybody in the galaxy showing up at your doorstep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
This planet is pretty big, ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And it is largely uninhabited.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
More importantly, it is protected by that weapon of yours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Weapon? I am aware of no such thing on Proculis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure about that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, best behavior.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is as good as it gets, Major. Chaya, the only reason we're alive is because of a powerful energy weapon that emanated from somewhere on the surface of this planet. It destroyed the ships that were shooting at us. That weapon is what's keeping the Wraith away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
No, Dr. McKay. It was Athar who protected you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Athar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Yes. Athar saw you were in need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Chaya, there are a lot of people just like&#8230;you and me, who are in need because of the Wraith. What you have here&#8212;what Athar has provided you&#8212;is a very rare thing&#8230; But we have a lot to offer, too. That's what friends do&#8212;they share. I think we could help each other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I understand. I shall consult with her now.</blockquote>
<p>[She stands, as do the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Please stay here. I don't know how long this will take.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves, followed by the abbots.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"What Athar provides for you?" What, are you buying into this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney&#8230;what religious people don't take their religion seriously?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We didn't imagine that weapon, Major. We saw it with our own eyes, and we saw what it was capable of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps Chaya is simply unaware of the weapon's existence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Or she knows, and she wants to keep it a secret from us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She doesn't strike me as the lying type, either.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay huffs derisively.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, let's just see what Athar has to stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain," hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard lies down on a bench.]
</p><p>[Sometime later, Chaya returns with the abbots.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Major. We have conveyed your request to our Divine Mother, and although she does not doubt the righteousness of your mission, I'm afraid she cannot countenance any other people but hers settling here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And you really had to chant all that time to come up with that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is there any way we can ask Athar to reconsider?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Athar understands and sympathizes&#8212;these Wraith are a scourge among our stars&#8212;but she has to place the lives of her people first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I think we both knew what you were going to say long before you even went in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
We prayed for Athar's guidance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And what did Athar say? You're hiding behind your religion to justify your complete and utter selfishness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sternly)<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If Athar existed, she would be ashamed of herself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
We ask only to be left alone and in peace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So untold thousands, possibly millions of people will die out there when they could have been saved, all in the name of Athar. How very, very peaceful of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
You should be grateful to Athar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is a waste of time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Athar regrets that she cannot help you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And I'm sure those were her exact words.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's enough! Head back to the jumper. I'll be there in a minute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because you're not helping.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford, Teyla and McKay leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I apologize.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
He acts only in accordance to his beliefs, as do we.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But Rodney is right about one thing. This really is about lives&#8212;human lives. Sooner or later the Wraith are going to show up at Atlantis, and when they do&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
You're a warrior.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I don't know about "warrior."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
It is your vocation, Major. You will fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll try, but knowing what we're up against, and the odds&#8230; Look, I'd appreciate it if you would ask Athar to consider that we are her people. Even though we come from very far away, we're the same. We're human, which means we're not strangers. We're family.</blockquote>
<p>[A strong breeze blows through the courtyard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Evening breeze.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was kind of hoping it was a sign from Athar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Your words are most compelling, Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you. I was going for compelling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Do you truly believe we are family?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We are. I can prove it to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come back to Atlantis. See who we really are. Once Athar learns more about us&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
This is acceptable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
(alarmed)<br />
Chaya, please, you cannot leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Athar is with us always, no matter where we are, Zarah.</blockquote>
<p>[The breeze comes up again; she places her hand on Zarah's chest. He calms down.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZARAH<br />
I understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I am ready.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Chaya has arrived. Weir greets her. Teyla and Rodney look on, Rodney appearing very skeptical.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Welcome to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I hope you don't mind, but our doctors do require a medical exam of all off-planet team members and our visitors. But after that, perhaps you'd like a full tour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I would love that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major Sheppard has already promised to do so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(brightly)<br />
Of course he has.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course I have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Please, if you'll follow me to the infirmary&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Maybe I should tag along, in case you have any questions&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think I've got it handled, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There are a lot of systems you know absolutely&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Got it covered.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Weir, and Chaya walk away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fine.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Chaya gets scanned by the Ancient scanner; Beckett watches the results on a laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hold still. Just a minute more. Well, my dear, it seems you're just as lovely on the inside as you are on the out, if health is synonymous with beauty. You can get up now.</blockquote>
<p>[She sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
How does this device do what you say it does?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It creates images of the tissues inside your body, and they are picture-perfect.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Did you bring these machines back from your world?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Some. Others are Atlantean technology that we've figured out how to use, and a few&#8230;well, I haven't the vaguest idea of what they do. Hopefully one day I'll have a chance to meet one. I'll ask them myself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Do you know what happened to them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, some returned to Earth after the war with the Wraith. That much we know, but we also know that some of them ascended.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Ascended?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
To a higher plane, where they exist only as energy. Are all the people of your world as healthy as you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard steers around the threats.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper fires two drones and takes out two Wraith darts. Then the Jumper turns among the many ships.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Chaya takes her human form beside Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
What are you doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm here to help you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Help me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
To defend your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
Leave. I will take care of this.</blockquote>
<p>[She resumes her ascended form.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE PROCULIS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard moves away from the Wraith ships. The energy "weapon" appears again and starts destroying the Wraith. Sheppard sees what's going on and turns the Jumper toward the planet.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHAYA'S TEMPLE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard rushes up the stairs and back down. Chaya appears across the courtyard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is it "Chaya" or "Athar"? I'm just curious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
When I was a mortal, I lived here. This was my home. When those of us who you call the Ancients ascended, we were supposed to leave behind us all human ties. Some of us found that difficult.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So you couldn't stand by and watch your people getting wiped out by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
When their terrible fleet approached, I lashed out with my mind, and with a single thought, destroyed them all. The others of my kind did not approve of such interference with corporeal matters and so I was exiled. My punishment was the unending protection of this world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(walking toward her)<br />
Why pretend to be human at all?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
So that, time to time, I may walk among the people, know them as the good and kind souls they are. For thousands of years, I have come and gone to the villages, never staying too long to get attached to anyone&#8230;until I met you. I have never regretted the choice I made all of these years&#8230;until now. I am permitted to safeguard my people, but my people only. This is my punishment. This is what makes it punishment. If your people came here for my protection, the others would stop me. Do you understand? I can never help your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not sure I'm willing to walk away that easily. And I'm not just talking personally here, although that's definitely part of it&#8230; There is so much more we can learn from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I can't, John. The others won't allow it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's just&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
It is their highest law to never interfere. I am bound by those laws, however much I wish to help you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, uh, we can never&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I can never leave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I could come and visit. And now I'm flirting with somebody from another species.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
We're not as different as you think.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think we're more different than <i>you</i> think.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
I can show you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Show me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
By sharing each other. We will know each other as well as anyone ever can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. I've got to get the car back by midnight, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHAYA<br />
This will only take a few moments. Just close your eyes.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes his arms in hers, then partially transforms into energy, wrapping her energy around him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is cool&#8230;</blockquote>
