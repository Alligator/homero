<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A puddle jumper flies away from a large, ringed planet and toward a space gate. The right nacelle seems to be leaving a trail of gas behind.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Markham is piloting, Stackhouse acting as co-pilot. Ford rushes to stand beside him and look out the view-screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
How we doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKHAM<br />
Okay, Lieutenant, I think I've got her lined up pretty close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No such thing as close. You thread the needle, or we're dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKHAM<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It's okay, you can do it. Nice and easy.<br />
(calling to aft cabin)<br />
Okay, I think we're close enough to dial the gate!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes! Hurry up and get us back!</blockquote>
<p>[Stackhouse dials the gate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper flies toward the now active gate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard lies against the inclined ramp in the rear compartment. A cat-sized, insect-like creature is attached to the right side of his neck. Teyla and McKay are with him, each with a hand on his shoulders.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get this damn thing off me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Cut it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(calling forward)<br />
As soon as we establish a connection, radio back that we've got a medical emergency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There must be something we can do for him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's an emergency first aid kit behind the pilot's seat. Get it. Major, everything we try to do to remove it just makes the pain worse. Now try and be still.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard nods. Teyla goes to the cockpit.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is there no way to go faster?</blockquote>
<blockquote>STACKHOUSE<br />
(tensely)<br />
He's just trying to get us back in one piece.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla returns to the rear.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper's drive pods retract as it approaches the gate, but the right pod does not retract all the way. It clunks to a stop.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Atlantis Base, this is Ford. Jumper One is inbound with a medical emergency. Please respond.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The gate is active. Weir comes out from her office to the control room, approaching the technician.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR <br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
The reconnaissance team is reporting a medical emergency. I've alerted Dr. Beckett. He's on his way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Put on Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
He's the one who's injured.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay works with the med-kit.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What am I expecting to find in here that's going to get rid of that thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Something for the pain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think Tylenol's going to do it. He needs a doctor. How much longer?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Almost there!<br />
(into radio)<br />
Flight, Jumper One on final approach.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Weir. What's the nature of Major Sheppard's injury?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Some sort of funky alien bug attached itself to his neck. He's completely immobile.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
What's it doing to him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We don't know, but we can't get it off him, and we tried everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
You understand the risk of bringing something like that back to Atlantis?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, ma'am, I do, but we really don't have a choice in the matter.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood, Lieutenant. Good luck.<br />
(to Marine standing by)<br />
Quarantine the jumper bay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla tries to care for Sheppard as the jumper approaches the gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It's all automatic from here. Here we go!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper enters the wormhole, but is stopped by the nacelle catching on the inside of the gate. The ship grinds to a sudden halt.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The rapid deceleration renders Sheppard, McKay, and Teyla immobile on the deck.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper is at a standstill, only the forward part beyond the event horizon.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The gate is still active. Weir waits for them to come through.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Where are they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
I don't know. The gate's still active. All indications read they should be through by now.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The ship is only partially visible in the gate.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Teyla wake up. They see the event horizon between them and the cockpit, through the open doorway between.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The drive pod&#8230;the wing things that stick out when we're flying must've failed to retract. That's the only thing it can be, It's that, or the stargate shrank, which I highly doubt. This is a&#8212;a big problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What can we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know if there's anything we can do. I mean, this is a very, very big problem.</blockquote>
<p>[He notices Ford's arm protruding from the event horizon.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Give me a hand.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Teyla pull Ford out. He is immediately awake.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What the hell was that? That's strange.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That is the&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That scraping sound&#8230; We're stuck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, we are. Apparently the engine pod's failed to retract in time. It's a square peg, round hole.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Can we pull Markham and Stackhouse out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Our hands and arms would dematerialize as soon as we cross the event horizon. It's uh &#8212; there's no way to reach for them.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear the bug creatures noises and turn to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
The Major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He must have been knocked unconscious by the impact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Jumper One, this is Weir, what's your status?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Ford. Good to hear your voice. The four of us are still here but Markham and Stackhouse are inside the event horizon.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Say again?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control room.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ma'am, Jumper One is lodged in the stargate. Teyla, Dr. McKay and myself are in the rear compartment with the Major. He's in bad shape. Markham and Stackhouse are in the forward section.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
How did that happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Engine pods&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
We think it was one of the engine pods, but there's no way to be sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is the only viable possibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
If I understand you correctly, you won't be able to access the flight controls.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes, Elizabeth, it's an extremely intriguing conundrum, and one that I would love to discuss with you in detail until the stargate shuts down and this ship is cut in two&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, calm down&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
At which point of course&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney! If I'm going to be any help to you at all, I need to catch up. Lieutenant Ford, back it up for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We couldn't I.D the Wraith base of operations from space, like we did the last time we were there&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(voiceover)<br />
So we went to the same landing coordinates as before to get a closer look.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The jumper comes through the stargate and approaches the planet, cloaking along the way.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WRAITH PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team reconnoiters the crater where a Wraith ship had been found before.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? I thought you said it was in a mountainside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It was. We were inside it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's move.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk to the edge of the crater. It is empty.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This was the spot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's more of a hole than a mountain, really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Could it have been destroyed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
This is definitely not a blast crater.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, looks like THEY just picked up and left. So, ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I don't know, sir. That mountainside was covered in trees.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but the Wraith hibernate for centuries, right? So a lot of trees could have overgrown in that time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then we were held prisoner inside one of the great ships I showed you in the drawings. They've left to begin culling worlds.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay hears the noises of Wraith drone soldiers off to his right.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's movement down there!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith start firing on the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go!</blockquote>
<p>[They run from the pursuers.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She hardly meant begin at the beginning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
This is Intel she needs to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And we have less than thirty-eight minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Hold on. Why thirty-eight minutes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Because that's the maximum amount of time a stargate can remain open in non-relativistic conditions. It's one of the more immutable laws of wormhole physics and, oh, my, look at the time. It's now more like thirty-five minutes. Are we all caught up?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I get it. What do you need?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control room.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
All right. Let me put Kavanagh, Grodin, and Simpson in a room. See what they come up with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
That's good. And the Czech, the Czech. The Czech whose name I can never remember.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Dr. Zelenka?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
That's him. We'll work it at our end.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
What else?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
We'll call you. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett enters the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Where's my patient?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There's been a problem. Conference room. Oh, no. Keep a channel open with them at all times. And turn that damn alarm off!</blockquote>
<p>[They leave the control room.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The bug is pulsing, and there are spots of blood where it attaches to Sheppard's neck. Sheppard wakes up and sees Teyla looking through the med-kit beside him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi, Teyla. Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Something tells me we haven't made it to Atlantis yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[He sees Ford and McKay standing in front of the even horizon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford? What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We're stuck, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
In the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean my day just got worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're going with the assumption it was one or both of the drive pods. I don't know whether it was mechanical failure or&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It was damaged as we tried to take off.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WRAITH PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Wraith fire on the jumper as Markham and Stackhouse try to take off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The team is jostled around in the cabin.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're taking fire. Get some altitude!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARKHAM<br />
I'm trying, sir!</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no way of knowing really, but, uh, if you know of some way of manually retracting the mechanism&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Cockpit, on the left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The cockpit is regrettably demolecularized at the moment, but how about somewhere back here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. I didn't think so. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll be a foot and a half over there, taking some readings. Feel free to talk amongst yourselves.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Various scientists and engineers are rushing around the room. Weir enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, you've all been briefed. We have less than half an hour. Where's Dr. Zelenka?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAGH<br />
He's working up a simulation in Puddle Jumper Two. He went straight there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAGH<br />
If there was time, it would be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Let's not admit defeat just yet, Doctor. There're six people on that ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm just a medical doctor here, so forgive me if this is a stupid question. If they just stepped through the event horizon, wouldn't they come through with the front part of the ship when the gate shuts down?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAGH<br />
The front half won't re-materialize on this side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
The stargate transmits matter in discrete units. The front half of the ship cannot re-materialize until the whole ship has crossed into the event horizon. The stargate is essentially waiting for the contiguous components&#8212;meaning the jumper and everyone inside&#8212;to enter completely before it can transport them.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett looks to Weir for a translation.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He says the gate only sends things through in one piece.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Right. Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Unfortunately the outgoing stargate won't transmit the matter stream until the demolecularization is complete. When it shuts down, the entire forward section, along with the men inside, will cease to exist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And what about the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
The ship will be severed instantaneously along the event horizon. They'll be exposed to hard vacuum in 29 minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SIMPSON<br />
What if they closed the bulkhead door?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The rear portion of the ship would remain pressurized, become a sort of lifeboat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
It would leak atmosphere like a sieve.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SIMPSON<br />
It could buy enough time to send a second jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KAVANAGH<br />
And do what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Figure it out. Contact Jumper One and make the recommendation.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on a laptop connected to the ship. He jumps up and pushes a button on the panel behind Ford. The bulkhead door closes, leaving the cabin in darkness as the even horizon is covered.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(turning on a flashlight)<br />
Sorry. Here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
(over radio)<br />
Jumper One, this is Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're still here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
(over radio)<br />
We recommend closing the bulkhead door.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Oh, good thinking. What else?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
(over radio)<br />
We're still working on the problem. We'll get back to you. Atlantis base out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Thanks for calling!<br />
(to the team)<br />
Anybody else claustrophobic, or is it just me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Why'd you close the door?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So that when the stargate shuts down and the forward section is severed, we're not directly exposed to space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Will it hold?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Like a screen door on a submarine. I just prefer apoxia to explosive decompression. It's a personal thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
If the air is going to get thin in here, you really do have to calm down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait till you see how thin it gets in 27 minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Vacuum. That's thin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Knock it off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, I apologize for being the only person who truly comprehends how screwed we are!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't talk to me about screwed!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks chagrined.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And let's not give up on Markham and Stackhouse, either. There's plenty of time to solve this thing, but you've got to stop using your mouth and start using your brain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry, Major. I'm&#8212; I react to certain doom a certain way. It's a bad habit, and&#8230; maybe there's a way to manually retract the mechanism.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Maybe there is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(putting her folded up jacket behind his head)<br />
Here. You seem stronger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, it's just the pain's not so bad now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, it isn't. I can't feel my legs. Hands and arms are numb. I can barely move them, and the feeling's creeping up. Lookit, Lieutenant&#8230;what I'm trying to say&#8230;is if you don't get this damn thing off me, I have even less time than you do.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gets back to work.]

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER TWO</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and other techs work on the simulation.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
<i>Speaks Czech.</i></blockquote>
<p>[Weir arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Dr. Zelenka?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Apologies for not attending your briefing, Dr. Weir. There was no time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't want to slow you down, but I need to know what you're working on so I can communicate it to the team on Jumper One.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We are attempting to retract the um, uh&#8230;the&#8230;the drive pod back into the fuselage, from inside the rear compartment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Anything yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Oh, there's much redundancy in ancient technology making it dangerous for them to experiment in this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So they might accidentally open the rear hatch or shut life support off entirely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. Yes, yes. Which is why we are attempting to isolate the correct control pathway.</blockquote>

What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Remove his chains to the side.</blockquote>
<p>[She does so.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Place the lubrication right on the paddles.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford does so.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ready to go. Once the bug falls off, I'm going to have to kill it. I'll wait for it to charge up again, and I'll give him another jolt. McKay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
if we can't restart his heart on the first try I'm going to need the bulkhead door open again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Done.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens the bulkhead door.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
One of us is going to have to get him through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I will.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford places the paddles on Sheppard's chest but hesitates.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do it!</blockquote>
<p>[He shocks Sheppard, who convulses then settles back, unmoving. Ford puts his fingers to Sheppard's neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No pulse!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla tries to pull on the creature but it won't release.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
It won't come off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
Settle. It may take a moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Lieutenant?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla tries again, and the creature detaches. She tosses it onto the bench. Ford shoots it several times with his pistol, and it lies still, leaking thick fluid. Teyla wraps it in her jacket as Ford prepares the paddles again. Ford shocks Sheppard. He checks for a pulse at his neck again.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Nothing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Nothing! Let's get him through!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Ford lift Sheppard by the arms and maneuver him near the event horizon. McKay helps Ford put Sheppard into Teyla's arms.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Got him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla carries him backward into the wormhole.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
This is Lieutenant Ford. The creature's successfully been removed from Major Sheppard, but we were unable to revive him. Both he and Teyla are now on the other side of the event horizon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Thank you, Lieutenant. Rodney, you have seven minutes.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and a medical team arrive, rolling a gurney and dressed in hazmat suits.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on the crystal controls as Ford looks on.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm only halfway through all the possible circuit pathways and time's almost up. We're never going to make it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Just keep at it. There's still time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You should consider stepping into the event horizon. I'm serious. I'll keep trying till the end, but given your choices, that's a far better way to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
And leave you here alone with that thing wrapped up in my jacket?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You did check to make sure it was dead, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It's dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good, because explosive decompression and death by suffocation with that thing on my face is possibly the&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Work!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sorry.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The researchers continue working.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Two minutes, twenty seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, we're down to two minutes.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I know the time. I've still got over two dozen circuits I haven't tried.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the jumper and the Atlantis control room.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Don't be so methodical. Just pick one at random.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
If I do that, I run the risk of attempting to activate the same circuit twice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Just try!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
I'm telling you there's no way I can—-</blockquote>
<p>[A circuit combination happens, and there is the sound of a mechanism activating.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<p>[They listen for more sounds.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The pods retract, but the ship remains unmoving.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I think I did it.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett, the researchers, and Weir all wait in anticipation in their locations.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Elizabeth, I think the engine pod's retracting.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and others rush to the balcony to watch the ship come through. Halling and the Athosians wait on the stairs.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The puddle jumper sits still, even though there is now nothing interfering with it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Then why haven't you shown up?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
She's right. Why aren't we moving?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(realizing)<br />
It's inertia. The drive shut down before we went through the stargate. We've shed all our forward momentum.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford starts jumping against the forward bulkhead, as if to push the ship through.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're wasting your time. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(angry)<br />
Then what are we going to do?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They listen in frustration.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
One minute.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KAVANAGH<br />
(over radio)<br />
Wait! The rear hatch. Blow the rear hatch! It should give you enough thrust to make it through.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That could do it, but the only mechanism to blow the hatch is back here.</blockquote>
<p>[He indicates a switch near the rear of the jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You go through. I'll do it.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford opens the bulkhead door again.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, you'll get blown out into space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No, no, there's no time to argue, just go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Make sure you hold on to someth&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Just go!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford shoves McKay into the wormhole.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Thirty seconds.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The creature stirs inside the jacket. Ford braces himself then pulls the lever to open the rear hatch. All of the air gets sucked out of the ship rearward, including the creature. He hangs on as his body is blown horizontal.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The ship moves forward slowly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE EFFECT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The jumper comes thorough the gate, which shuts down. The personnel clap and cheer. The Athosians stand. smiling. Weir and Halling exchange confirming looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Grodin)<br />
I'll be in the jumper bay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is lying on the deck of the jumper. Beckett is using a defibrillator on him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Again!</blockquote>
<p>[In the aft compartment, Ford has been placed on a gurney and given oxygen. Weir arrives.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's going to be fine.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir clasps Ford's hand, then he gets wheeled out, and Weir and Rodney move forward to Sheppard. Beckett continues to work on him, but his heart is still flatlining on the monitor. Weir and Teyla exchange nods. Beckett shocks Sheppard again.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well done, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(tense)<br />
We'll see.</blockquote>
<p>[The medics work on Sheppard, including using an air bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We've got a pulse.</blockquote>
<p>[Markham and Stackhouse join everyone in sighing in relief.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Getting stronger.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett takes off his stethoscope and listens to Sheppard's chest by ear.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's going to be okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir sits down on the bench suddenly. Rodney paces around the rear compartment and exchanges glances with Beckett. Sheppard appears to be sleeping peacefully.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is awake and smiling at a nurse who has finished changing his bandages. He is dressed in red scrubs. The rest of his team and Weir are there, dressed in civilian clothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How are you feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Starving.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's got quite the hickey, but Dr. Beckett says he'll be fine in a few days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We should let you rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, you should get me food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I think we can arrange that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(tapping Sheppard on the shoulder)<br />
Welcome back, sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla, Beckett, and Ford start to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I have to admit, it is a pleasant surprise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
By the way, what were you going to say?</blockquote>
<p>[The other three stop to listen.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
When?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Before, when you thought, you know&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, that&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I didn't want you to say it at the time, but now I'm curious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was going to say, um&#8230; Take care of each other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's nice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And, uh indeed, we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, you did. Thank you. Again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're welcome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good night.</blockquote>
<p>[They all leave but Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You weren't really going to say that, were you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I have no idea what you're talking about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I didn't think so.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves. Sheppard gets comfortable on the bed and closes his eyes, smiling.]
