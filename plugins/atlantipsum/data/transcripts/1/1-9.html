<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M5S-224, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate is shrouded in mist. Dual columns of obelisks lead to it from either side. The team is wearing full hazmat suits as they make their way past the columns to the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I've never seen so much nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And I've never walked so far to see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How was I to know the only structures on this planet would be in the immediate area around the Stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's the gate. Dial it up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait. The energy readings here are exactly the same as they were a mile away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I really think we should stay for a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I thought you hated wearing these suits.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I do. I'm incredibly uncomfortable, but these energy readings are amazing. It's like it's coming from all around us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And yet you cannot explain it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can't figure out a way we can use it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Then let's call it a mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There is such a thing as pure science. Not everything has to be immediately useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You talked me into coming here because you thought those energy readings indicated the presence of a civilization. There are no buildings, no people, no nothing. Just fog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's not technically fog. There's no actual water vapor in the atmosphere. I mean, you know, for that matter, I don't think we need to wear the hazmat gear.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls his hazmat helmet off and gasps in relief. Sheppard and Teyla do the same.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now you tell me. Dial the gate.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay shakes his head in disappointment. Ford dials the gate, and it activates. McKay studies his computer pad.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's move out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You wanted useful?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When the wormhole connected, there was a wild fluctuation in the energy field. I mean, if I'm reading these numbers right, it looks like the gate is actually drawing power from the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So? To the best of my knowledge, this field goes on for miles. I mean, for all we know, it envelops the entire planet. We're talking about a lot of energy here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How much is a lot?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, in terms of joules or ergs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
In terms of&#8230;lots.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, lots and lots. Enough to open a wormhole back to Earth.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is definitely intrigued.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir speaks to the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I thought the Atlantis gate was the only one capable of dialing Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is, but that's because it's the only one with an additional control crystal that allows the eighth chevron to lock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's probably a security measure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It doesn't matter. As long as we have the control crystal, I can make the other gate work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're suggesting we remove it from our DHD and bring it to M5S-224?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Isn't that risky?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think she means in terms of breaking our own gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know what I'm doing. Besides, the control crystal is useless without enough power.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You said you didn't know where the energy on the other planet was coming from.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I believe it is being generated somehow in the atmosphere itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The fog?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You said it wasn't fog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whatever it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, how do you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(becoming annoyed)<br />
I don't yet, but the fog, or the mist, or whatever you want to call it, is the only thing around for miles, and the energy readings were constant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, even if you can pull this off, we have to assume that the Earth gate lacks a power source capable of establishing a wormhole back to Pegasus. So whoever went would be taking the risk that it might be a one-way trip.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sure someone will volunteer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Believe it or not, I would only go if I knew there was a good chance I could come back. At least, we can send a message to Stargate Command. Let them know that we're okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've gathered a lot of intel. We should send it&#8230;if we can. Even if it's over a radio.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir nods.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay is under the console; Sheppard sits beside it. McKay climbs out holding a crystal.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right. That's it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So how easy will it be to put that thing in the other DHD?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Atlantis' DHD is unique. It's not like there'll be an empty slot waiting for us to plug it in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Meaning?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Meaning that there may be some disassembly required.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You want to take the DHD apart?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll put it back together again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Do you not run the risk of disabling the other stargate?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Only if I screw up, which is extremely unlikely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Eight hundred and forty years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's how long it will take us to come get you by puddle jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But you would do that, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course we would.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it won't be necessary. However I may require some assistance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Ford)<br />
Lieutenant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(unhappily)<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;M5S-224, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate is active. McKay and Ford have just arrived.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Atlantis, this is McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><i>[The scene shifts between McKay's location and Weir in the control room.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're ready to begin work on the DHD.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're sure about this, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Positive. The next time you hear from us we'll be delivering the good news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We'll be back in time for supper.</blockquote>
<p>[The Stargate shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Ford)<br />
All right. Let's get started.</blockquote>
<p>[He approaches the DHD and kneels down beside it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is sitting on his bunk reading War and Peace. There is a knock.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hi. Do you have a moment?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, sure.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts the book down and sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
War and Peace. That's some heavy reading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, well, back on Earth, when I was getting ready for this mission, I realized there was a good chance that I might be here for a while, so I figured why not bring along a book that takes a while to read.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Page seventeen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm right on schedule.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hmm. That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about: home. Going home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
McKay is right. If this works, and we are able to establish a wormhole back to Earth&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, if this conversation is going where I think it's headed, you can put your mind at rest. I'm not going anywhere. I haven't read my book.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look, all I'm saying is that you are the person who is best qualified to brief General Hammond and the other powers that be about the Wraith threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe so&#8230;but I think I'm needed here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(smiling)<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But if you want to go, I understand that, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What, are you saying, I'm not needed here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I said I'd understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, thank you, but I made a commitment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course in all fairness, life-sucking aliens weren't part of the brochure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Regardless, I'm staying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. Wouldn't be the same without you.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange grins.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M5S-224, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So if this works, would you want to go back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think it matters what I would want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because Atlantis can't afford to lose me. I'm their foremost expert in gate theory, wormhole physics and a myriad of other sciences too numerous to mention yet too important to ignore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'd love to see my grandma. She thinks I'm somewhere in Afghanistan or something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(ignoring Ford)<br />
On the other hand, if anyone's going it should be someone that commands the respect of the SGC and yet has the patience, knowledge, and determination to bring them up to speed and find a way to bring the cavalry back here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So what you're saying is you're invaluable everywhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Granted, it would create a void if I were to go, but you can all take comfort in the knowledge that I'll be on the other side, spearheading the effort to return with reinforcements, fresh supplies, and Big Macs for all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I feel better already.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay misses that Ford is being sarcastic.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR, NEAR GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla approaches Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Major Sheppard. Have we heard back from Dr. McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Word of the discovery has already spread throughout the base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've noticed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is to be expected, of course&#8212;faced with prospect of being reunited with loved ones, returning to familiar ground.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I'd love to go back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You would consider leaving Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I just wish I knew I could gate back here. Then I'd go in a heartbeat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It would be wonderful to see your world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You could help me with the briefing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I would like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, you know more about the Pegasus galaxy than anyone. Then there's all those cool Earth things I've talked about&#8212;football, ferris wheels&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla is intrigued.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh! Do you remember the last of the popcorn we ate? We can get more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If we knew we could return.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Unscheduled activation!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir, Teyla, and Sheppard arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
It's a radio transmission from Dr. McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Elizabeth. I'm done. The component's installed in the DHD, and as you can see&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well done. Sorry, what about the energy readings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, same as before. All indications are that the gate's drawing power from the atmosphere, and there's enough for an eight-chevron lock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(smiling)<br />
Okay, you stay put. We're on our way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE TRAVEL</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M5S-224, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So are we, uh, ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's there to be ready for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, this is sort of a big moment, and I thought we haven't been in contact for some time. I just figured we&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay dials the address.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Please work.</blockquote>
<p>[He hits the activation button. The gate comes to life. McKay smiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Stargate Command, this is Dr. Elizabeth Weir of the Atlantis expedition. Do you read? I repeat, this is Dr. Weir. Come in, please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
This is Sergeant Harriman of Stargate Command. Whoever you are, this better not be a joke.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No joke, Sergeant. I'm sending my personal IDC for confirmation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Sorry about that, Dr. Weir. We're just a little surprised to be hearing from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Understandable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
The iris is open. You're clear to come through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thanks, but we're not ready to risk a one-way trip.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
You don't understand, Doctor. Things have changed around here. The Asgard are in the process of fitting Prometheus with engines capable of reaching other galaxies. We were manning a mission to find out what happened to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Is he serious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you serious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HARRIMAN<br />
Yes, Ma'am. Come through now, and you could be back in Pegasus inside of a month.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well&#8230; who's going?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE TRAVEL</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Hammond stands at the base of the ramp.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Welcome back to Earth.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir looks around, satisfied.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and McKay brief Hammond.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And while the Pegasus galaxy does hold many dangers, I feel its potential rewards justify the risk of maintaining a continued presence on the Atlantis base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Unfortunately, Doctor, your preliminary report has given the Pentagon cause for concern. If the Wraith are as powerful as you say, that would make them an enemy even more dangerous than the Goa'uld. There are those who believe it would be prudent to cut our losses and abandon the Pegasus galaxy altogether.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
General, you can't&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
We are talking about a race that defeated the Ancients.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Over its years in operation, Stargate Command has encountered a number of threats that could well have brought about the destruction of this world. Now, that never stopped you from continuing to send teams through the gate, General.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
By the time SG-1 had returned from their first mission, the damage had already been done. We'd alerted the Goa'uld to our presence, and shutting down operations wouldn't have changed that. In the case of the Wraith, however, we have a choice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So we're just going to turn tail and run?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
The Pentagon would prefer to call it "a strategic withdrawal."</blockquote>
<p>[McKay huffs derisively.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But how can we be sure they won't come after us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
She's right, General. They feed on human life forms, and now they know there's a smorgasbord waiting for them here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't think we have a choice. We need to continue to explore the opportunities for technological advancement Pegasus galaxy has to offer, and not to mention our responsibility to the other humans who live there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Responsibility?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We did wake up the Wraith. And while, yes, that would've happened eventually without our interference, our access to Ancient technology puts us in a unique position to help those people. We can't just walk away.</blockquote>
<p>[Hammond sighs and pauses.]
</p>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Rest assured your recommendation will be given consideration at the highest level.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SGC CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sees Hammond come around a corner.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, General, sir!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard jogs to catch up with Hammond, who has entered an elevator.]

I'm surprised the briefing went as quickly as it did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You were very thorough, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Thank you, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
In fact, by now I thought you'd be enjoying some well-deserved R and R.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was just going to arrange some transportation, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Well, consider it taken care of, Major. Anywhere you'd like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(surprised)<br />
Well, that's very generous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You've done your country a great service, son. You deserve it.</blockquote>

I was afraid you had abandoned me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just setting up our ride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So&#8230;where are we going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We should start by getting you a&#8230; new outfit.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DRIVEWAY ON EARTH, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Weird drives up in an older-model, red BMW convertible. She finds Simon working on a Maserati in the driveway. He is shocked to see her. She gets out of the car.]

Oh, my God. When did you&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[After a moment, he hugs her.]

I missed you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm, must've been a power failure or something. Anyways&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He sits on the couch and uses the remote to turn on the TV. He digs around in the couch cushions and finds a half-eaten bag of crispy snacks. He eats one.]

Yeah, you seemed like you were having fun. Hours and hours of fun. But you picked out a nice outfit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Dr. McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Forget Prometheus. I have figured out how to establish a wormhole connection back to the Pegasus galaxy, but I'm going to need the ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
The ZPM has been depleted. It's of no use.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, that's not entirely true. The last time we used it, the ZPM had to establish and maintain a wormhole back to Atlantis. This time around, all we need for it to do is to have enough energy to establish the briefest of connections&#8212;by my calculations, approximately, what, 3.5 microseconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
That hardly seems like enough time to accomplish&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
General, when we first set foot on M5S-224, before the wormhole shut down, I picked up fluctuations in the energy field. Now, at the time, I just assumed that was an effect of the gate's residual energy signature. But having given it some thought, I realized that can't account for such sizable variances, which leaves only one possible explanation. The gate must have been energized on our arrival, meaning it doesn't just draw power on outgoing wormholes, but on incoming wormholes as well. All we have to do is make a connection. 3.5 microseconds, that's the minimal amount of time it requires to confirm a lock before the gate automatically kicks in, drawing power from the atmosphere to maintain the wormhole.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You'll forgive me, Doctor. This all seems a little far-fetched.</blockquote>

We are the mist, and every time the gate is activated, lives are lost. Over time, explorers have come and gone, completely unaware of our existence. Sacrifices are made to ensure our secrecy. But when you came back, we grew concerned. To learn your intentions, we had no choice but to enter your minds. When we discovered what you were about to do, we were forced to take preventive measures.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But you just said you'd let others come and go. Why not allow us to do the same?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Your desire to return to your home world was too strong. The amount of energy required to gate to another galaxy would have killed millions of our kind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So when we dialed the gate&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
You never dialed the gate. You just imagined you did. You are unconscious, even now, on the planet's surface.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So none of this is real? The cute brunette. Of course, I should've known. I mean, how do you go from "You're a pig, but I like your cat" to "I missed you"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
We lacked a sophisticated understanding of your world. As a result, the illusions we created from your thoughts were ultimately flawed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The dead people were a dead giveaway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dead people. What were you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If you had just told us, I mean, maybe we could&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, wait. I just realized something. You're saying that our unconscious bodies are still on the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, so we need food. We need water. I mean, we need food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What he's saying is we won't live long in this state.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Then I suggest you make the most of the time you have left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're killing us in order to save yourselves.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
In order to save millions of our kind. I believe you would do the same.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If we do not go back, our friends will come looking for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
Others of your kind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They'll show up. What are you going to do, kill them, too?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
More will come.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sooner or later they'll figure out how to access the gate. Then millions of your kind will die. We don't leave people behind, and if you were really General Hammond, you'd know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But if you allow us to leave here, we promise we will never return, ever. You will not have to fear us ever again. I give you my word.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
How can you make such a promise when you so desire to return home?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure, we'd like to go home. We're not willing to kill millions of your kind to do it. You've been in our heads. You're in our heads right now. You should know we mean that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
(after a moment of contemplation)<br />
I understand.</blockquote>
<p>[The room dissolves into green gas.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;M5S-224, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The five are lying unconscious on the ground, still dressed in their field gear. They all awaken, McKay grunting as he gets to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't mean to sound negative, because that would be, you know, so not me&#8230; But, uh, how do we know this isn't a double fake-out? I mean, how do we know that this is&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HAMMOND<br />
(by voice)<br />
This is your reality. You have my word.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm starving. He's got to be right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I wonder how long we've been out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I need to get the control crystal out of the DHD. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[He goes to the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'll give you a hand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you for trusting us. Rodney, be careful with that. I want to make sure we can get back home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah, you mean Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think that's what she meant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How do I know she wasn't suggesting we pull a double fake-out of our own and dial Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Forget the double fake-out and get the damn crystal. I'll do the dial-out.</blockquote>
