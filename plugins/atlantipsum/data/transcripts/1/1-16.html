Yes, the chamber has been sealed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTA<br />
Where are the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTA<br />
The Brotherhood has fallen, Astrum. We're all that remains.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ASTRUM<br />
My God. If we die, then&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>PORTA<br />

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(walking with her)<br />
Allina, I know I've said this before, but thank you so much for letting us in here, helping us through the material. It's been utterly fascinating.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard, Ford, and Teyla sit at a table full of old scrolls. McKay and Allina walk past, McKay carrying an armful of old books.]]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
I'm happy to do it, Doctor. I'm sorry this information is so scattered. I'm afraid we're working on so many projects at once, reference materials tend to get misplaced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course.<br />
(looking inside a book)<br />
Look at that.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Ford and Teyla laugh over a joke. McKay approaches them with an irritated expression, carrying a piece of white parchment.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is going on here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just having a little fun, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can we get back to work now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I just don't see how running through history books is going to find us our ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(holding up the parchment)<br />
Really? See this? This is a charcoal rubbing taken from an Ancient temple built about the time Weir's list was written. Notice anything familiar? Hmm? It's a ZPM. Look, we are close, closer than we have ever been before. Now, there may very well be hundreds of zero-point modules hidden in this galaxy, but the only one we are remotely sure of is here. Here.<br />
(somberly)<br />
Now, if you ever want to go home, if you ever want to protect Atlantis from the Wraith, we need to find this.</blockquote>

</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONFERENCE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do they have any idea where the ZPM could be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
According to legend, an Ancient from Atlantis came through the stargate and entrusted a sect of Sudarian priests with a rare treasure, or "Potentia," as they called it. This Lantian told them to keep it hidden from the Wraith at all costs. Now, the Sudarian people worshiped the Ancients and considered the Potentia their most sacred artifact. Now, predictably, they did exactly as the Ancient requested.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The Potentia being&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So they wouldn't have used it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
From what I can tell, they only brought it out of hiding to be displayed on high holidays. I'd be surprised if they knew it could be used. And that is good news.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If they didn't know how to use it chances are it's completely full.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The bad news however, is that after ten thousand years of Wraith culling, Sudarian society is essentially extinct. The planet's inhabitants are only at a Renaissance level of development, but with the help of some of our gear, I really think they could make some headway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right. I'm sold. Major, take your team back to Dagan. See if you can get us a ticket home.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Shirtless soldiers train. One lies on the floor. A man with a large scar on his right shoulder puts on a uniform coat. It is Kolya.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
Does it still pain you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
(to soldiers)<br />
Leave us.<br />
(to Pranos)<br />
What do you have for me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
The Atlanteans have returned to Dagan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
You're sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
Oh, yes. Our operative just checked in. It's only been 12 hours since they left. They must be getting close to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Do we have any idea what "it" is yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
We know a little more. Our many off-world spies have been keeping a close eye on the Atlantean teams from afar. But this is the first planet we've managed to get this close to them. They're looking for a Lantian-era power source.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
Is Chief Cowen sending a team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
Not yet. His priorities are elsewhere. Even if he was, he would never send you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
The last thing the Atlanteans need is more power. Get me on that planet, with or without Cowen's blessing.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Chuck the Technician works on a console with Zelenka. Chuck drinks from a metal cup.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
I don't know what happened. It just stopped working. I got some of the functionality back. It still isn't doing everything it used to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, well, maybe if people stop insisting on having food and liquid in such close proximity to the ten-thousand-year-old equipment&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Hey, we're very careful. We're not the problem here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Ah. Yes. Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka leaves a laptop running and steps away. After a moment, the large Ancient screen becomes scrambled.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What did you touch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Nothing. I didn't touch anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
<i>Curses in Czech.</i>
(looking at laptop)<br />
Then why is it&#8230; What is this?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka and Weir walk.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I didn't know we had deep space sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, well, no one did. From what I can tell, they've been running silently in the background along with our other primary systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
In the background?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So why the sudden leap to the foreground?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Excellent question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We don't have an answer for that yet, do we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Not as of yet, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, well, keep me in the loop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(chuckling)<br />
You are the loop.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka continues beside Weir, looking uncomfortable.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Isn't that a nice thing to say. You're more than welcome to continue walking with me, but if there's something that you need to do&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. Yes.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LIBRARY ON DAGAN</b>
</p><p>[Allina briefs the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
They called themselves "The Quindosim," a brotherhood of fifteen monks whose sole occupation was to keep the Potentia, or ZPM, safe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fascinating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes. Fascinating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Please, go on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Brotherhood of the fifteen consisted of a "Master Handler," five "Protectors," and nine "Stone Carriers." Their greatest fear was that the entire Brotherhood might one day be culled by the Wraith, which would result in the ZPM going missing forever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Missing, yes, but it would not fall into enemy hands.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
They were entrusted with the ZPM. Their hope was that one day the Lanteans would return to reclaim it and reward the Sudarian people for completing their task.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So they left hints, clues, should the Brotherhood be destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
That's right. The priests created nine stone markers that, when united, are supposed to reveal the final resting place of the Quindosim's protected treasure. So far, we've only found three. The etching on the rocks involved many lines and dots. We think it's a map.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm. Amazing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It is, actually. This looks like an Ancient numbering system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
That's what we thought. From what we can tell, they're numbers three, six, and seven.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling kindly)<br />
Excellent work. I mean, seriously, I'm very impressed here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
That's very kind of you, Doctor.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives McKay a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where did you find them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
This building used to be their monastery, actually. We pieced together some of the information we found here, and tracked down the number six and seven stones. We found the number three stone on an unrelated dig just last week.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, if we find the stones, we find the map?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Yes, exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here. You see this?</blockquote>
<p>[He gives a stone tile to Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Part of the design?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't think anything on these stones is there just for aesthetics. Here. Yeah. Each of the stones has a different part of the grid embossed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Signifying where its correct placing should be in the final configurations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
"So what?"<br />
(to Allina)<br />
Do you have a map?</blockquote>
<p>[Later, Allina is showing them a paper map of the excavations.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, where did you find them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
We found the seven stone here&#8230; The six stone here&#8230; And, most recently, we stumbled on the number three stone here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You have no idea how lucky a find that was.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts drawing crossing straight lines on the map.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
I see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Doctor, I am not sure I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're buried in a grid. Look, we couldn't have done this without the number three stone. That, along with the number seven stone gives us two diagonally opposed corners. From that, you can extrapolate exactly how big the grid is, and therefore where each of the other stones should be buried.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, split up, two teams. Let's start digging.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WOODS OF DAGAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kolya, Pranos, and Genii spy Tathal walk.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
Do you think they'll find it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TATHAL<br />
Many people from many worlds have come to find the lost treasure of the Quindosim.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRANOS<br />
Do you think they will find it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
I do not know. We'll wait for them to find the treasure, then take it by force. Your men are not to act until I give word. Understood?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TATHAL<br />
Absolutely.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;WOODS OF DAGAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Elsewhere, McKay leads Allina and Sanir on the search.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which would make us, uh&#8230; Right, I think.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Can you believe the progress we've made, Sanir? How many years have we been searching for these stones?</blockquote>
<p>[Sanir suddenly stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SANIR<br />
We should not be helping them, Allina.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
They are helping us as much as we are helping them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SANIR<br />
They will take the Potentia if they find it. You must see that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
They have come to us from the great city of Atlantis. It is for them that the Brotherhood of the fifteen have kept the treasure hidden.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SANIR<br />
I do not trust them, Allina.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
If you would rather head back to your village than help us, I will not stop you.</blockquote>
<p>[They continue on with McKay.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay the Dagan women, and Teyla, Ford and Sheppard dig in marked excavation pits in different locations.]
</p><p>[Later, Sheppard finds a box.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Check this out.</blockquote>
<p>[He opens the box and finds a stone tile. Elsewhere, Teyla finds one as well, as does McKay at his location.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;EXCAVATION SITE, DAGAN</b>
</p><p>[Sanir finds the box.]
</p>
<blockquote>SANIR<br />
Allina.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls a tile from the box.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is going to work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
I think it just might.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LIBRARY ON DAGAN</b>
</p><p>[The teams have re-joined. McKay stands beside a map posted on the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
It's a layout&#8230; of the Sudarian villages. The walls of this monastery have protected it for ten thousand years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's beautiful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
(smiling flirtatiously)<br />
It is&#8230; And yet, my eye is drawn elsewhere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking around, bemused)<br />
Hmm? How so?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
I'd like to restore it one day, but I'm afraid of damaging it. Perhaps you could help me, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Really, you need to start calling me Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Very well.</blockquote>
<p>[They sit down on a bench. McKay yawns.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
I don't bore you, do I?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No, no. It's not you. I just don't think I've ever been so tired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
But you're a scientist. Are you not used to this by now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm, yeah, but my kind of science is the good kind of science, the kind you can do sitting in a chair or even laying on a couch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
What was it like? Growing up in the city of the Ancestors, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no, no, no, no, we didn't, uh&#8230; We come from a planet called Earth, in an altogether different galaxy. We only just recently made Atlantis our home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
How recently?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, just a matter of months, really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
You're tired.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Do not let me keep you from sleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If you insist. I'll, um&#8230;yeah. Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks away. Allina sighs.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LIBRARY ON DAGAN</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters the area where the rest of his team is eating at the main table.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm heading to bed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which bed might that be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I think Allina might have a little crush on you, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, she does?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is very clear to us all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
It is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, everyone but you, apparently.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Should I have, um&#8230; Are you sure about this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I'm very sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What should I do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't know what to do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know what to do, eventually. I mean, what should I do now? Should I say something, something tonight?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tell you what, Valentino&#8212;wait till tomorrow. You'll be more on your game after you get some rest.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Right. Right. Good answer.<br />
(more loudly, so Allina can hear)<br />
Good night.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;EXCAVATION SITE ON DAGAN, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Allina study the stone tiles they have found while the rest of the team digs.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
It doesn't look much like a map. I guess I was wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm, possibly, although, um, well, you know, just because you originally thought it was a map doesn't make your initial assumption bad or incorrect. Well, incorrect, yes, but it was a good guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(tentatively)<br />
You're&#8230;very, very smart, and, uh&#8230;and attractive and whatnot, and, um&#8230;Uh&#8230;you've got a lot of things going for you even when things don't&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard has walked up behind them to drink some water.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Is everything all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Everything's great. Everything's really&#8230; Why wouldn't it be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're sure we're in the right place? We've almost doubled the size of the dig site, and we haven't found anything yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's got to be the right place. The other eight stones were almost exactly where we thought they would be. Why would this be any different?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Major!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Tell me you found the stone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Not quite, sir, but I think McKay should take a look at this.</blockquote>
<p>[At Ford's position, they uncover a large cover stone with a symbol on it.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
It carries the mark of the Brotherhood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The writing's in Ancient. Can you read it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a warning. It says, "Only the Brotherhood of the Fifteen should enter the forbidden chamber&#8212;"</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
"Of the Quindosim."</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What chamber?</blockquote>
<p>[They set up a tripod with a block and tackle, which the use to move aside the cover stone. Ford activates some chemical lights and tosses them into the shaft below. It is not very deep.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So, who wants to go first? Seems sort of like a Sheppard thing?</blockquote>
<p>[Later, McKay and Ford lower Teyla into the shaft. Sheppard has already gone. From a ridge nearby, Kolya watches through a spyglass, flanked by other Genii.]
</p>
<blockquote>KOLYA<br />
We couldn't have planned it any better.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;UNDERGROUND CHAMBER ON DAGAN</b>
</p><p>[McKay is lowered into the chamber.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Easy, Ford! God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, he's down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(from the opening above)<br />
All right. I'll stay up here, keep an eye on the descender.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stay sharp. I'll let you know if anything interesting happens.</blockquote>
<p>[Allina has found a platform with spots for the nine tiles.]
</p>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
Do you see this? This is the whole pattern.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So the ninth stone must integrate into this raised center piece.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay notices hand-shaped indentations on either side of the platform. He puts one hand in one.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
May I?</blockquote>
<p>[He puts his other hand on the other side, but nothing happens.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe we can rule out a map.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Any ideas?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm getting there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to a team leader)<br />
Yes, get your team together and head off to section seven.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Dr. Weir, Dr. Weir, I was finally able to interface our computers with the Atlantean long-range sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Excellent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
There's an unidentified craft about the size of a Wraith Dart heading for the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[They rush inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm sorry. The sensors picked it up days ago, but it's taken me until now to finally decipher what they've been trying to tell us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
A Dart. How is that possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, perhaps it was modified to get here as quickly as possible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Atlantis might fall if we don't take this ZPM back. Then it would serve no purpose. Do you really think the Ancestors would have wanted that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
None of us can know their plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They don't have a plan. Do you think getting attacked by the Wraith and chased out of the galaxy is something they planned for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Allina, you're far too smart to think&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
The Potentia will be put into hiding on another world. When the Ancestors return our people will be greatly rewarded.</blockquote>
<p>[She takes the ZPM from McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Allina, you can't believe that. Look, come back with us. Let me prove it to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ALLINA<br />
This is how it must be. Now it is time for you to leave.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team has returned.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Did you try to explain&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I tried. Believe me, we tried.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We could have used it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Of course we could have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, you don't understand. While you were off-world, a Wraith Dart flew over our city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We lost a Jumper, along with Markham and Smith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shocked)<br />
We what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And it scanned us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We just lost two of my men and a Jumper, and this is the first time I'm hearing about it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I tried to reach you, but you've been out of radio contact for over twelve hours. Now, the Dart sent a transmission deep into space, and then it self-destructed before we could get to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, we scanned the area with our deep space sensors and, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We have deep space sensors?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah. It's a long story.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And we found something else&#8230;rather unsettling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm already unsettled. Show me.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka activates the large screen, showing three large ships.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are those?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Wraith hive ships. Three of them. The system analysis just got back&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. Where are they headed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If they maintain direction and speed, they'll be over our planet within two weeks.</blockquote>
