<p>Investigating an Ancient weapons platform in space, Sheppard and McKay discover the wreckage of a downed Wraith ship on a nearby planet. On the planet's surface, they learn that it is a supply ship, transporting humans for food. What they don't know is that a single Wraith has survived the crash &#8212; and has stayed alive by feeding off the cargo!<br /><br /><a href="/wiki/SGA_1.12_%22The_Defiant_One%22_Episode_Guide" title="SGA 1.12 &quot;The Defiant One&quot; Episode Guide">Guide</a>&#160;|&#160;<strong class="selflink">Transcript</strong>

<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay is flying the jumper, with Sheppard in the co-pilot seat. Gall takes a seat behind Sheppard, while wiping his face with a handkerchief. Another scientist, Abrams, sits behind McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ease up on the controls a little.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're going to snap the damn things off. Ease up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm just seeing what this baby can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Did you just say "this baby"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's perfectly appropriate space pilot parlance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just try to fly the baby in a straight line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm flying in a straight line.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard brings up a HUD display showing their flight path. It weaves back and forth around a straight line to their destination.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not so much.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively, chastened)<br />
Well, in space, all motion is relative.</blockquote>
<p>[Gall fans himself with his handkerchief. He looks ill.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay, Dr. Gall?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I get motion sickness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
These things have inertial dampeners. You shouldn't feel a thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I-I know we're moving. That's enough for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(leaning over to whisper to McKay)<br />
Why'd you choose this guy for the mission?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(leaning over as well)<br />
Brendan's the one who discovered the Lagrangian Point satellite was out here. Elizabeth felt he should see it for himself.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay has let go of the controls while talking.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't let go of the controls!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(taking them back)<br />
Snapping doesn't help!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is why parents get someone else to teach their kids how to drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I am both insulted and touched by that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
(looking out view-screen)<br />
Oh my God.</blockquote>
<p>[Out of the view-screen, a space structure comes into view.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The huge satellite has many components jutting out from a central structure. The Puddle Jumper approaches the much larger satellite.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The shadow of the satellite darkens the cabin.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(turning in his seat)<br />
McKay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes, of course, please.</blockquote>
<p>[They exchange seats, Sheppard taking control.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Holding station at one thousand meters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're almost a half a mile away and it's filling the windshield. This thing is enormous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
It's as large as a Goa'uld mothership. This might be the single largest weapons platform ever constructed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's probably the Ancients' last line of defense before Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any chance it's still operational? Because that would be a very good thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Are you getting any energy readings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Negative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So it's dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Well, it warrants closer scrutiny, but, yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Knocked out during the Ancients' last stand?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Or its power source is depleted. Ten thousand years is a long time. We should still take a closer look&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Wait, wait. I'm getting something in the ultra-low frequency range.</blockquote>
<p>[He puts it on the speaker, and they all hear a rhythmic static.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's it coming from?</blockquote>
<p>[The HUD shows a location on a map.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
The planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a distress call&#8230;a Wraith distress call.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper keeps station near the weapons satellite.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
You're sure it's Wraith? In this solar system?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know. Celestially speaking, it's right in our backyard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We figure the Ancient satellite shot the Wraith ship down in the final battle for Atlantis.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into comm)<br />
And it's still putting out a signal after thousands of years?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the control room and the Puddle Jumper.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a very weak signal. Look, if any part of that ship is intact, the wealth of scientific and military knowledge we could acquire is invaluable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So what are you saying?</blockquote>
<p>We have to go down and take a look.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You have to? It took you almost fifteen hours to get there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, all the more reason we should have a look. We're already here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I should mention that the planet's atmosphere is extremely ionized. Radio communication could be difficult.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks sharply at Gall, and McKay motions for him to shut up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And it would take at least fifteen hours to send out any sort of rescue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We'll be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I agree with McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of course you do. How could either of you resist exploring a crashed alien spaceship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I assure you, our interest is purely professional, Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Seriously, the amount of intel we could gather from their weapons system: codes, shields&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right. Proceed with extreme caution, please, and check in with me in three hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, three hours? That's hardly enough time&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Will do. Jumper One out.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The jumper has landed on the desert-like planet. McKay stands outside, putting chap stick on his lips. Abrams and Gall exit the ship as well, followed by Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(mocking)<br />
"Radio communication could be difficult."</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Hey, she said yes, didn't she?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And no thanks to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, knock it off, guys. I've spent the last fifteen hours listening to you two.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks past them, but they don't follow him. He stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are we ready? All right, let's remember where we parked.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard activates the jumper's shield.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The four walk down a dry ravine with some foliage. Some small volcano-shaped mounds lie on the ground, emitting some smoke.]
</p>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Why didn't we just land next to the ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just a precaution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
A precaution for what? The Wraith ship crashed thousands of years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Automated defenses.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I never thought of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't worry, Brendan. We weren't all built for fieldwork.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Seriously, we're almost there, right?</blockquote>
<p>[A small insect-like light creature comes out of one of the small mounds and buzzes around the team.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Some kind of a bug?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Space bug.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
It's giving off a pretty strong life-signs reading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, okay, did I mention how allergic I was to bee stings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe it smells the food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Maybe he's just smelling the girlish fear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, let's leave it be, and it'll leave us be.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(fearful)<br />
Guys&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They make their way around the bug.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They make their way to the crashed Wraith ship, which is partially buried in sand. It is quite large.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Have you seen one like this before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's too small to be a hive ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, it's been here for a very long time. Maybe they've discontinued that model.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard checks the ship with binoculars and finds a large hole in the hull.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe, but whatever it is, it took a hell of a hit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Score one for the Ancient satellite.</blockquote>
<p>[Through his binoculars, Sheppard sees skeletons lying outside the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's still some skeletons down there. I guess everyone didn't die in the crash. Are you getting any life signs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think we can rule that out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's just a precaution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fine.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes out his life-signs detector, clearly annoyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, it's just us and the glowy bugs. Nothing coming from the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. Let's go take a look.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk toward the ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[The team stops at the entrance left by the hull breach, which is covered with a curtain of Wraith "tissue".]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm picking up faint power readings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Something had to be powering the distress beacon.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard enters, followed by McKay. Gall enters then notices Abrams has not followed him.]
</p>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Come on, Abrams.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Maybe one of us should stay outside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Look, I know how you feel, but how many opportunities like this are we going to get?</blockquote>
<p>[Abrams joins him.]
</p><p>[Later, the team is exploring the ship's interior, using their flashlights. They come upon a dead Wraith soldier, covered with cobwebs and dust.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
This guy looks like he just laid down and died.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's remarkably preserved.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or it wasn't that long ago. All right. Beckett'll want samples.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay prepares to take samples.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is&#8230; Yeah. Okay&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls aside some webbing to reveal aged tissue on the body.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the&#8212;?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. This is different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wraith cannibalism?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They feed off each other?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Probably as a last resort.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
I guess some of them tried to survive as long as possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, that is incredibly disturbing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No kidding. You know, I wonder if there's&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
(from another room)<br />
Guys!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay, Sheppard, and Abrams go to find Gall.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HUMAN STORAGE AREA, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[They find Gall in a large chamber full of pods.]
</p>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
They're bodies, human bodies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They have chambers like this on hive ships. I've never seen one so large before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Wraith cocoon humans. They keep their bodies in suspended animation, so later they can&#8230; Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think we just figured out what this ship is for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a supply ship, on its way to feed the Wraith who were laying siege to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Well, that's terrifying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Gall, Abrams, check it out, but be careful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
What? No, wait.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Where are you going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the ship's got to have a bridge. Maybe we can get some useful intel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
So you're just leaving us here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's the problem? They're all dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
That's the problem!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just get some D.V. and a rough head count. We'll stay in radio contact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
That could be difficult. This part of the ship seems really shielded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Weir only gave us a few hours. We'll check in every few minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling)<br />
You wanted fieldwork. This&#8230;is fieldwork.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay jogs after Sheppard. Gall nervously pulls out a video camera.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir talks to Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Lieutenant, I'd like you to put a team on standby for a rescue mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Is the Major all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sure everything's fine. I'd just like to have a team ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So just in case?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah. Just in case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Sheppard walk down a corridor.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not picking up anything in the E.M. spectrum. I may need to rig up a secondary power source so we can interface with their computer systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm just thinking out loud here&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How long do you think the Wraith could feed on all those humans back there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, they're capable of hibernating for hundreds of years at a time, but, I mean, think about it. Ten thousand years ago was roughly the dawn of human civilization.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So there's no chance that uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, no, no. Are you kidding? Well&#8230;maybe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. No. No living thing could survive that long under those conditions. It's ridiculous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That would require an incredible power source capable of sustaining the stored humans in suspended animation almost the entire time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So it's possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, my God. It is possible. We've got to get out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;HUMAN STORAGE AREA, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Gall, Abrams, this is Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
(startled)<br />
Major, are you trying to scare me to death?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm probably being a little overcautious, but we need to&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[His voice is overtaken by static.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
We need to what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Major, say again. Your radio's breaking up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Let's fall back to our point of ingress. We're headed back to the jumper.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay head out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HUMAN STORAGE AREA, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I think we're getting out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[A distortion of the air passes over them quickly.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I just saw something in the corridor behind you. We can't go that way.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major, I just saw something.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR, CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
All right, stay put. We're coming back to you.</blockquote>
<p>[They start running.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood. There's nothing out here. Brendan, you're just freaking out on me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I'm telling you, I saw something.</blockquote>
<p>[Gall points his weapon toward Abrams, who puts up his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Put that thing away. You're going to kill someone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
I know what I saw!</blockquote>
<p>[Something drops behind Gall; Abrams sees it.]
</p>
<blockquote>ABRAMS<br />
Oh, my God.</blockquote>
<p>[Gall turns to see it's a Wraith. Smiling, the Wraith throws Gall aside then steps up to Abrams and starts feeding on him. Nearby, Sheppard and McKay hear Abrams' screams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This way.</blockquote>
<p>[Moments later they come upon Abrams, now an old man sitting on the ground. They look around cautiously.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith drags Gall down the corridor. Gall is covered in fine webbing.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[McKay examines Abrams.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He is dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Where's Gall?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Gall, this is Sheppard. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It must have taken him.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at his life-signs detector; sees two dots moving.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're right. They're on the move.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to disarm Abrams' body.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What're you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Taking his weapons and his ammo. Here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I already have a gun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now you have two.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're not planning on going after the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I plan on going after Gall, then I plan on getting the hell out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I swear there was nothing alive when I scanned for life signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They don't show up as life signs when they're hibernating. Okay. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith checks over Gall's instruments. Beside him, Gall starts to wake up. He starts breathing heavily.]
</p>
<blockquote>GALL<br />
Please!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith snarls at him.]

</p><p>[Ford, Teyla, and another soldier are suited up for a mission.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
They're not even overdue yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It doesn't matter. Call it intuition, paranoia, or we can just call it a drill. Either way, I want you to go now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We can always be called back, but if they are in trouble&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Then every moment counts. Exactly. Ford, who's your pilot?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Markham.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good. He could use some piloting practice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
And I've packed enough ordnance to fight a small war.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Let's hope you don't have to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yes, ma'am. Let's move out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CRASHED WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay come upon a dead Wraith. Sheppard takes oblong metal weapons from the body; they are grenade-like.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know, but I don't have the ordnance I should have, and it takes a lot to kill these guys. I'll take any edge I can get.</blockquote>

You have come here by ship. Where is it?</blockquote>

You're going to kill me anyway.</blockquote>

But not all at once.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay, run!</blockquote>
<p>[They run in opposite directions. The drone hits the Wraith, exploding and leaving nothing but a crater. Sheppard takes a look around to be sure.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(waving)<br />
Still here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(over comm)<br />
Sir, this is Ford. The target is gone.</blockquote>

Well, it's about damn time.</blockquote>

You're welcome, sir. We'll be there in just a few minutes.</blockquote>

We can wait.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and McKay meet at the crater.]
</p>

Thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah. You too. You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Other than this and a few cracked ribs&#8230;<br />
(noting McKay's silence)<br />
What about Gall?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sadly)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts toward the jumper. McKay follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You'll have to put the ship back together, provided you can disarm the shield.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fine. As long as we get to go home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can drive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, thank you.</blockquote>
