<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[An armada of Wraith hive ships and cruisers enter a hyperspace window.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay briefs many personnel in front of a display showing the expected Wraith trajectory.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not only has Teyla been able to ascertain that the Wraith are more interested in Earth than Atlantis &#8212; which is, you know, terrifying &#8212; she realized that the hive ships will go right past the only surviving Lagrangian Point satellite.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The last of what we assume were dozens of defense satellites destroyed during the Ancients' last stand with the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes, yes. The point is, we think we can use it to our advantage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you said it was dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is, but we think we've learned enough about how it works to bring it back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
If we are right about what is wrong with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, of course, if we're right about what's wrong with it. But if we're right, and it's just out of power, the Wraith have simply been ignoring it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Our preliminary estimates indicate a single naquadah generator would be enough to bring it back online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Why can't we use our generators to get the weapons systems of Atlantis working?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Because those systems were designed to be powered by the zero point module, and the satellite isn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And you think it's powerful enough to take out a Wraith hive ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, according to the Ancient database, it should be able to take out all three when fully charged. Keep in mind that the Ancient technology is far superior. They only lost the war because they were vastly outnumbered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, we're vastly outnumbered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
And outgunned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
But they don't see the satellite as a threat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
In military parlance, surprise&#8230;is an element on our side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What do you need?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The satellite's fifteen hours away by puddle jumper. I recommend that we put together a small crew. Say, myself, Grodin&#8230;and a pilot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, Miller can handle it. Major, I need you to keep searching for alternate Alpha sites, just in case this fails.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The hive ships will be in range of the satellite in 49 hours. We're going to need every last second of that time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Questions? Okay, let's get on it.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone starts to get up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, Rodney&#8230; I don't mean to put any undue pressure, but at this moment, that satellite is the only thing standing between the Wraith and Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(walking past McKay)<br />
No undue pressure.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Beckett stand beside Teyla's bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm looking for something a little more enthusiastic than "fine."</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am ready to be put back on active duty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sure you think so, but, uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Tell him I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She is, Major. I see no further reason she should be kept here under medical supervision.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard asses her for a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. You're back on active duty.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns away. Teyla sighs in relief.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Zelenka prepare the generator and other items for the shuttle.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think I can handle this alone, Radek. Is there not something better you could be doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I think I should go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I agree. Go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I mean on the mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Sure, you probably know a little bit more about the satellite than I do&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Generous of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
But you know a lot more about the city than I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I think I see where this is going now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
If, for whatever reason, there is a problem there, it should be me, not you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's not going to be a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Rodney, you don't know that. There&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If it seems like we can't fix it, we'll just turn around and come back. Now, I realize I'm invaluable everywhere, but&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You know what? Forget about it. I take it back. No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Sorry. Nope. You can't take it back because you've just admitted that I am smarter than you are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I admitted no such thing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, it was hard for you to say but the truth shone through, and you were compelled to speak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You are a miserable little man.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's not ruin the moment here, huh? Now&#8230;keep an eye on my city for me while I'm gone, hmm?</blockquote>
<p>[They shake hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right. All right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay wheels the cart of equipment out of the lab.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir, Sheppard, and Bates look at laptops.]
</p>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
MA5-393?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, we've only been there at night, and it gets ridiculously hot during the day, so, no, not really an option.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We wouldn't be having this problem if the damn Alpha site that we'd picked hadn't been marked by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're a real pain in the ass, aren't they?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, they are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How about M4H-212?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Nah, crawling with Genii spies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do you know that for a fact, Sergeant, or is your "Spidey sense" just tingling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
It's a fact, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Here we go&#8212;M1M-316. Stackhouse reported lush surroundings, and as far as his team could tell, it seemed uninhabited.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll get my team together and check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, good. Remember, Major, we don't need ideal. I think we'd all settle for close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm on it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves. Bates gets up to follow.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[They walk down the stairs to the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Major. Is Teyla coming with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're not seriously asking me that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
I think that's a bad call, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Here we go again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
All I'm saying is we still don't fully understand her connection to the Wraith, and in my opinion, I don't think we should expose her to information we wouldn't want the Wraith to have&#8212;not the least of which is the location of our evac site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The doctor gave her a clean bill of health.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
And that's good to hear, Sir, but if she can't control how the Wraith use her&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You don't know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
That's right, we don't. She saw everything they saw. Who's to say they can't do the same with her, see what we see? If she's been compromised in any way&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's an integral part of my team. Period. End of story. We're done.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LAB</b>
</p><p>[Weir has joined Zelenka.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
This simulation I've put together. It shows how the city will be destroyed once we trigger the self-destruct.</blockquote>
<p>[A large display shows an animation of the explosions, with the city breaking into large pieces that then sink to the ocean floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So glad you felt I needed to see this. I was just thinking how my nightmares need to be more vivid.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's not going to be enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Our self-destruct plan. It's nowhere near effective enough.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Now, that seemed pretty effective to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Atlantis is more than just a city. It is an intergalactic spacecraft.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, well, Teyla said the Wraith are not interested in destroying Atlantis. They're coming here to get to Earth. They can only do that by going through the Stargate&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Which means stealing the city, which is why we have a self-destruct in place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but if they are even the least bit resourceful, which I must assume that they are, they can easily reverse engineer their own intergalactic engine from the wreckage on the sea bottom.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So we need a bigger bang? Break into smaller pieces?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, well, that would certainly help, but I'm more concerned about the Ancient database. Its ability to back up data is incredibly redundant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Incredibly redundant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, that one never gets old, but, seriously, if the Wraith recover even the smallest part of the Ancient database&#8230; That is my concern exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, how hard would it be to destroy all the database terminals?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Impossibly hard. We need to figure out a way to delete the Ancient database.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, can you do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I can find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, find out, but before you wipe anything out, we're going to have to consider&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
(over radio)<br />
Dr. Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
We have an unscheduled off-world activation. Major Sheppard is coming in hot.</blockquote>
<p>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE room
</p><p>[Personnel have taken up defensive positions. The 'gate is active.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
They ran into some sort of resistance. I'm thinking Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Wraith? I thought you said this planet was uninhabited.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
It was.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard, Ford, and Teyla come through, firing into the wormhole. The Stargate shuts down.]
</p>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
I told you she was a liability, sir. Now, I'm not going to let your personal feelings endanger this facility any longer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Look, I'm not accusing you of doing it intentionally, but the Wraith must be getting information from you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell are you talking about? We ran into a&#8230; What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Looked an awful lot like a T-Rex, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, a T-Rex. Wasn't even a Wraith. So why don't you check those accusations?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I take it you don't recommend the planet as an Alpha site, Major?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wouldn't be my first choice. If McKay doesn't get the satellite on line, we're screwed.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper flies through space.]
</p>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
(over radio)<br />
Dr. Weir, this is Miller. We're approaching the satellite.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
You're on the other side of the solar system, Lieutenant. You guys be careful out there.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[McKay is in a space suit while Miller pilots the ship and Grodin sits in the co-pilot seat.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay puts on his helmet and steps to the aft cabin.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay. Close the bulkhead doors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Good luck.</blockquote>
<p>[The bulkhead closes.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper approaches the very large defense satellite.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla catches up with Bates.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Sergeant Bates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(angry)<br />
You just accused me of disclosing our position to the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
(defiant)<br />
Yes, I did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Clearly you were wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
That's yet to be determined, ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Look, I'm willing to accept that you're not fully in control of what information you give away, but it's still my opinion that you should not be allowed to move freely around this base of operations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps you are not aware, Sergeant, but being accused of serving the Wraith is the greatest insult among my people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Oh, I'm aware.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla hits him in the face. Sheppard and Ford arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell is going on here?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Ford hold Teyla and Bates back from going after each other again.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I was simply stating an opinion, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
She attacked me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
And for good reason.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, and what reason would that be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
My guess would be the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Walk away, Bates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
Sir!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Walk away!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BATES<br />
This isn't over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I would be disappointed if it were.</blockquote>
<p>[Bates leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angry, to Teyla)<br />
What the hell are you doing? You don't go around decking the head of security.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He said I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't care what he said. He says a lot of things. You just stay away from him.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla nods and leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper docks at a docking station of the satellite.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE</b>
</p><p>[The port opens, and McKay slowly enters the satellite in zero gravity conditions. The sounds of his breathing is heard as he makes his way along a connecting corridor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation shifts between the satellite transfer tube and the Puddle Jumper.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
You're breathing pretty heavily.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, feeling a little claustrophobic. How much air do these things hold, anyways?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MILLER<br />
Eight hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, that's enough, right? I mean even with the heavy breathing? I imagine they would calculate that in, right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
You're going to be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one with the eight-hour ceiling on their breathing.</blockquote>
<p>[Grodin and Miller smile at each other.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE</b>
</p><p>[McKay floats to the bottom of the tube. He moves around the room and tries to activate a control panel. Nothing happens.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's completely dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Well, we thought as much.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm going to hook up the naquadah generator. See if I can get some life support going.</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to pull on the tether attached to his suit, to pull the equipment down.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Halling arrives with other Athosians. Halling goes into Weir's office.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Halling, hello.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
May we speak?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Please, have a seat. How is the evacuation on the mainland coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
We'll be ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Dr. Weir, the word is there is a plan in place to destroy Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
There are concerns the Wraith would be able to make it to Earth if the city is left intact. But I assure you that plan will only be executed in a worst-case scenario.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Such as&#8230;three hive ships flying towards Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We do believe we'll be able to destroy them before they arrive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
I understand you fearing for the well being of your people&#8230; But it is not reason to destroy the city of the Ancestors. Atlantis is a sacred place. To even consider destroying it merely for self-preservation&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Merely for self-preservation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
This place is all that remains of the greatest race ever to inhabit the stars.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you would prefer it fell into the hands of the Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
I would have faith that the Ancestors would not allow it to happen. They have been able to preserve Atlantis for ten thousand years. Is it not possible&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, I don't think it is possible. Not if you're suggesting the Ancients will return in time to save their city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
You cannot know their plans for Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They have made all the plans they are going to make. Now it's up to us. I thank you for your thoughts, Halling, but I have to do everything I can to make sure the power and technology of Atlantis does not fall into the hands of the Wraith&#8230; And, yes, to ensure they never make it to my galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HALLING<br />
Even if it means sacrificing the future of this one?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir is taken aback; Halling gets up and leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS LAB</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You know, the idea is simple enough. It's the execution that is proving to be very difficult.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're creating a virus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Essentially, yes, a plain old computer virus. Once introduced into the system, it will wipe the database clean. It could be downloaded as part of the self-destruct countdown. It might even affect the Wraith's systems if they try to access it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How much of it could we save?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Of the database. We brought a lot of hard drives with us. How much could we transfer to our computers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You mean, like, back it up? Take a copy with us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Using McKay's compression code, I'd say maybe seven, maybe eight percent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(surprised at her surprise)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>

</p><p>[The defense satellite rotates slowly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE</b>
</p><p>[McKay is now in a cloth jumpsuit; life support has been restored to the satellite. Grodin and Miller are with him. They are still weightless.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here we go.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay activates the generator. Lights come on. Grodin floats to a control panel.]
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Primary power online. Looks like life-support's now at one hundred percent. I think I found the switch to initialize the gravity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Great, just give me a second to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Grodin is already turning on the gravity. McKay falls to the bottom of the tube.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(rolling over slowly)<br />
Oh! Oh, yeah. Yep. That's permanent back damage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Sorry, I&#8230;assumed it would come on more slowly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you assumed with my life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
You'll be fine. It was just a little bump.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're heading back in to pick you up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
Stay exactly where you are!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, we're cloaked. They won't see us.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GRODIN<br />
There's no time. Just get the hell out of here! &#8230;I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Miller)<br />
Get us back to that satellite.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DEFENSE SATELLITE IN SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Wraith ships fire on the satellite, destroying it in moments.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, god!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not screwing around, Bob! Did you sabotage this base or not?</blockquote>
<p>[He fires on the Wraith again.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Those who feed upon you will know what you've done to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. We'll see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sir I think maybe we've gone a bit too far.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think we've gone far enough.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(upset, into radio)<br />
Atlantis, this is McKay. We have lost the satellite.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Everyone is shocked.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Did you manage to take out any more ships?</blockquote>
<p><i>[The conversation switches between the Atlantis control room and the Jumper.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Negative. Two other hive ships are intact. Elizabeth&#8230;Peter Grodin was aboard the satellite.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka puts his head in his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Understood. What's the status of the other two?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're not coming any closer. It looks like they're rethinking their plans. At the very least&#8230;he has bought us some time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You can't do any more out there, Rodney. Return to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're on our way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Technician)<br />
Put me on citywide.<br />
(over intercom)<br />
May I have your attention, please? This is Dr. Weir. Our plan to stop the Wraith armada has failed. They will make it to Atlantis. Therefore, we must begin our evacuation plans. I wish I could tell you all that this is a fight that we will win, but I can't do that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard listens while holding a gun, while the Wraith hisses in laughter.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I wish I could tell you that we will find a safe harbor when we leave here. I can't promise you that, either. I can tell you this&#8230; Up to now, you all have accomplished extraordinary things, and I believe that even in the face of an uncertain future, as long as we stay together, we have a chance to continue to do so. Now, we all have our evacuation duties, so thank you, and I'll see you on the other side.</blockquote>
<p>[She nods to the technician, who turns off the intercom.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Dr. Zelenka put the virus program on standby.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka does so, and his computer starts to beep in warning.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIG</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
I will tell you this&#8230; No matter where you flee, we will find you, just as surely as we will find Earth. And when we do&#8230;we will feast.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shoots and kills the Wraith.]
