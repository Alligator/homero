<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper comes through a space 'gate above the planet.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team is aboard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm just saying, as a team veteran, to the new guy&#8212;heavy lunch before mission departure, bad idea. I mean, even with the inertial dampeners, this whole flying thing is best done on an empty stomach.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, well, I've got a pretty strong stomach.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey, I can eat frozen dinners without thawing them, and sometimes it even affects me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
McKay, are you reading anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Nothing. Life signs from the planet are negative.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then it is a shame. From what we read in the Atlantis database, the Dorandans were a wonderful race of people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the database is over ten thousand years old. You can bet things have changed around here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(seeing something)<br />
Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p>[There is a large debris field ahead of the Jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. That's not something you see every day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There was a great battle here.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[They pass by larger pieces of debris.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(voiceover)<br />
That is a hive ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That was a hive ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Something put a lot of holes in it all right. We should check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What if whatever put holes in it wants to put holes in us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Like you said, a lot's changed in ten thousand years.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper descends through the debris to the planet.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;DORANDA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper skims a ruined city. Thunder and lightening strike it.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That would explain the lack of life signs.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This is what usually happens when you fight back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
These folks took out a fleet of Wraith ships. I'd say they did a pretty good job fighting back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hold on. I'm picking up faint energy readings, coming from
(pointing)<br />
there. Well, that explains how they would be able to put up such a good fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because&#8230;they were Ancients.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper maneuvers to a large building that remains.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;DORANDA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A large building remains. It appears to have a large weapon on the roof.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The team descends a ladder into the dark facility. They look around with flashlights.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Definitely Ancient design. Their latest stuff, too. Their latest being ten thousand years old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It looks a lot like the labs we've found on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So this was one of their outposts?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yet the ancestors made no mention of their presence here in their database. Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, let's find out. Can you power it up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Working on it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay works on an Ancient tablet while the others search around.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've got two bodies here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I've got three more over here. Whatever happened here, no one came back to claim the dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can't tell if they were fed on by the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, something killed them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Something killed everyone on this world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then why is this outpost, if that's what it is, still intact? It doesn't make sense. What do you think, Rodney?</blockquote>
<p>[The power comes on, and the lights.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hah. Sorry, I wasn't listening, but it just struck me that this is an Ancient outpost. Why would the Wraith leave it intact?</blockquote>
<p>[The others exchange glances.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a good question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(examining tablet)<br />
Huh. All right. So&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and his team walk through with Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So it's a military research facility?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
From what we can tell, it's a ground-based version of the satellite weapon we used to destroy that hive ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
With one major exception&#8212;firepower. I mean, if that single outpost is responsible for destroying an entire Wraith fleet&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you're sure it was this weapon than destroyed all those Wraith ships?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It had to be. There's nothing on the planet that suggests the Dorandans had anything capable of inflicting anywhere near that much damage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If we could learn of such technology, we could defend other worlds from being culled.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It didn't save the Dorandans.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but at the end of the day, the outpost was still standing, and that means, uh&#8230; Well, I'm not sure what that means, but it means something definitely worth finding out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's right. It's definitely worth sending a research team back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good! Well, give me Optican and Collins, and Zelenka, if he's over the stomach flu. We'll try to access the computer's logbooks, see if we can decipher them&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. Okay. Easy sell. Go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Good.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rushes out. The others exchange looks at his enthusiasm.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon meet up.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla. Um&#8230;I heard you were heading off-world on a personal mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
To Belkan, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sounds interesting.</blockquote>
<p>[She smiles at him, and he returns the smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Belkans possess a particular disease-resistant strain of flax seed, which would double the yield of our crops on the mainland. In exchange, I intend to offer Athosian manpower to aid in their harvest. Still interested?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Uh, this place&#8230;has everything I could want, don't get me wrong, but, uh&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Sometimes you feel the need to go somewhere else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Anywhere else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know the feeling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Bring only weapons you can conceal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'll keep it to a bare minimum.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DORANDA, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[Many scientists are at work. Sheppard arrives and goes to look through an observation window into a large chamber, lit from above.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I'm telling you, at least point-oh-nine percent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, please. Please, move the decimal place. I mean, it's impossible, for God's sake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have we figured out what this is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I wouldn't say no. No, we have a theory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But we don't know yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No, but based on the shielding around the chamber, what else could it be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have you tried turning it on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's what we're working on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The problem is that there's no direct link between it and the main power control systems, which, among other things led us to theorize it's an ancillary power supply for the weapon systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Cool.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
See that? See? See the way he lights up at the mention of that? It's like Dr. Vogel at the mention of pastry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They found out a way to soup up their space guns?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but it's much more than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The sticking point is that there's no tie between the power generator and the primary capacitor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, meaning they would have to channel the power directly into the weapon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Which, I'm sure, means nothing to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It means they could fire multiple bursts without having to store up more power for the next firing sequence.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is reluctantly impressed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Very good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which leads me back to "cool."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but it only makes sense if we're right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
About what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Tell him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Come on, McKay. You read the equations. What else could it be? An Ancient typo?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we know they're not perfect, because they're all dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I just&#8230; I don't want you to get all excited over nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, maybe you're right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, I'll give you a hint. It seems the Ancients were experimenting with high-energy physics on a level that we've never seen before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(underwhelmed)<br />
Wow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, "wow." I just&#8230;I want to be sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(humoring them)<br />
I'll do my best to wait.</blockquote>
<p>[He leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CONFERENCE ROOM ON BELKAN</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Ronon negotiate with the Belkans.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The manpower that you are demanding is outrageous. You would turn my people into nothing more than indentured slaves to serve your farms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HENDON<br />
It would seem that you have nothing else of value to trade but your people.</blockquote>
<p>[A man enters with a tray of drinks.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Mattas&#8230; You know full well my offer is fair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MATTAS<br />
I'm sorry, Teyla. If you had something of more value to offer&#8230; Technology, weapons&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You've heard my terms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HENDON<br />
Hmm. Then our business is done here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon angrily stabs the wooden table with a knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She said her offer is fair.</blockquote>
<p>[They stand and face each other across the table.]
</p>
<blockquote>HENDON<br />
I say it isn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, I say it is.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;BELKAN VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla exit the building into the primitive village. They are carrying bags of seeds. Teyla drops hers and turns to face Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I had the situation under control.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It didn't look like it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So you came to my rescue? You have no idea what is at stake during these negotiations. My people depend on me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They were taking advantage of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, they were not, but that is what I wanted them to think. A negotiation is a delicate process. The words spoken are often meaningless.</blockquote>
<p>[Mattas sees them from a nearby staircase.]
</p>
<blockquote>MATTAS<br />
Teyla!</blockquote>
<p>[Mattas goes inside to come around to mee them.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Do you want me to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Go. Gather our things. I will meet you at the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MATTAS<br />
It was a mistake to force Hendon's hand. You'll only pay for it next time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MATTAS<br />
Your friend is not Athosian?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. Ronon is the only survivor of a world named Sateda. He saved the life of a friend of mine. In return, we offered him sanctuary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MATTAS<br />
If Sateda is his home-world, then he is not the only survivor. There is a man in this village who also claims to be from there.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla is shocked.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The 'gate is active.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What have we got, Sergeant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
It's Colonel Sheppard, Ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
This is Weir. Go ahead, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper flies back through the debris field toward the orbital Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We're on our way back. Rodney wants to fill you in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I take it you've found something interesting.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Interesting? How about the greatest discovery of all time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
He's pretty excited.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
So I hear. He couldn't even wait until he got back.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I wanted to send an encoded data-burst directly from the outpost to the secure network in my lab while the gate was active. Now.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Receiving transmission. Transferring data.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Care to fill me in so I can be excited too?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
It's a weapon&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
It is much, much more than a weapon. We think we've stumbled across the Ancients' last great discovery. It was too late to win the war for them, but if I can finish the work they started&#8212;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It is the ultimate power source. Something that would make zero-point modules seem like alkaline batteries in comparison.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Col. Caldwell has arrived.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It was called Project Arcturus, and from what we can tell, its ultimate goal was to render ZPMs obsolete.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How?</blockquote>
<p>[He uses the large displays to illustrate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A zero-point module is an artificially created region of subspace-time. It's kind of like a miniature universe in a bottle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It extracts vacuum energy from this artificial region of subspace-time until it reaches maximum entropy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So what's different about this thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Project Arcturus was attempting to extract vacuum energy from our own space-time, making it potentially as powerful as the scope of the universe itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
This strikes me as something the Ancients would've tried first, even before ZPMs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And they may have, but extracting zero-point energy from our own universe is&#8230;well, it's definitely trickier.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Explain "trickier."</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, because we actually have to live in our own universe, it presents a whole range of problems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, obviously it's not that easy, or Atlantis wouldn't still rely on ZPMs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you're right. The Ancients couldn't make it work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I said I wanted to do all the talking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, Rodney. Arcturus was a total failure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Failure, yes. Total, no. Look, the Ancients were losing the war against the Wraith when work on Arcturus began. If they could have made it work it could have turned the tide of war. I mean, we're talking about their own Manhattan Project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The outpost was ordered by the Ancients in Atlantis to defend the Dorandan people using their weapons powered by this new power source.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yeah, yes, but despite their strong reservations that it was not ready to be tested under battle conditions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, the point is, the Wraith won.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, but the Dorandans still inflicted massive damage on the attacking Wraith fleet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not saying they didn't put up a hell of a fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The logs indicate there was a major malfunction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well yes, the Ancients in the bunker were forced to shut everything down, including the weapon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Wraith sent more ships, the Dorandans got wiped out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So if the malfunction hadn't occurred, the Ancients would've saved the planet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Definitely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Possibly. Don't sugarcoat this Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Ancient scientists running Arcturus were rushed into testing before they had perfected a means of effectively controlling the power output. I believe if they'd had more time, history would've played out differently on that planet. Possibly in this galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I won't deny that this is something that we'd dearly love to get our hands on, but the Ancients were a pretty bright bunch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And desperate and losing a war they'd already been fighting for a hundred years. More importantly, they were&#8212;they were, like, this close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you believe you can finish their work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They do.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MCKAY'S LAB</b>
</p><p>[McKay issues instructions to his staff in a montage.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, I need everyone's attention, please. What we've got here&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I need this code divided into sections and each one double-checked&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, you're not listening to me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's not going to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm telling you this one right here is wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The whole point here is that these numbers here need to be corrected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Unless they're corrected&#8212;there you go. Simulation failed.</blockquote>
<p>[They keep running simulations that all file.]

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ANCIENT FACILITY ON DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard takes a heavy case from a scientist on the ladder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's heavy. So, I need that over there. Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[In a tube-like passageway, Zelenka and another scientist work. McKay speaks to Zelenka over the radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I want you to pull the crystal. Pull it when I say go, all right?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka pulls the crystal, and the power shuts down. Later, McKay is in the command access tube and Zelenka is in the Ancient lab.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
I think we have it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay puts the crystal in, and the command access tube lights up. In the lab, Zelenka smiles.]

<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk up the stairs to where a group is gathered at a table, listening to a man telling a story.]
</p>
<blockquote>SOLEN<br />
Was I afraid? Of course I was, but my people were counting on me. Now, I was alone, and I was low on ammo, but I managed to take out the three Wraith guards and gain access to the ship.</blockquote>

Harry K. Daghlian.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He was a scientist. Worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. He was only 26 years old. Accidentally irradiated himself while performing a critical mass experiment on two half-spheres of plutonium. It took him a month to die, and while his body was slowly shutting down from radiation poisoning, you know what he did with his last thirty days? Hmm? He worked. He tried until his last breath to understand what had happened to him so that others could learn from the tragedy. So that his work, his death wouldn't be rendered meaningless.</blockquote>

Can I come in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Ancients had it wrong. Our mistake was using their equations. Look, I just did the calculations again myself. I did them three times just to be sure, and I am positive the problem is in the automatic containment protocols.</blockquote>

Okay, what's your fix?</blockquote>

I'm proposing that we adjust the field strength manually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You saw how fast it spiked on you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So we don't operate the generator at anywhere near its potential. Look, there's no need to be greedy. Even operating at fifty percent, it'll still generate the power of a dozen ZPMs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How come the Ancients didn't figure this out?</blockquote>

Okay, we have been over this. I am doing this manually, at half power. It's a cakewalk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It don't think it matters how much cake you walk on. I've been doing calculations of my own, and I believe the very act of trying to contain vacuum energy from our own space-time creates an environment where the laws of physics cease to apply.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you on about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
As power output increases, new and exotic particles are continuously created and destroyed inside the containment chamber, interacting with each other, and with the field itself. Eventually, particles are created that cannot be predicted in this space-time. And they breach the containment field as hard radiation.</blockquote>

I believe if the overload is allowed to continue, the weapon acts as a sort of release valve to prevent catastrophic containment failure. The Ancients barely managed to shut it down, and they lost their lives in the process.</blockquote>

What we're suggesting is that the Wraith didn't kill everyone on that planet. It was the weapon itself.</blockquote>

</p><p>[They rush in and go to their seats.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, strap in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You need to avoid flying in predictable trajectories to prevent the weapon locking onto us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know what I'm doing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm just saying, be sure not to fly in a straight line.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, shut up!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DORANDA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper leaves the planet, maneuvering to avoid the energy weapons pulses passing all around it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can I just say there's no way the Jumper can take even one direct hit?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll keep that in mind.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard maneuvers the Jumper through the debris field, the weapon firing all around them.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Weapon's locking onto us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How about I fly us away from the planet, and return after the overload?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, don't you understand? This explosion is going to take out three-quarters of the solar system. There's no way we can fly far enough, fast enough. We have to head for the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Dial the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay starts dialing.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper continues its jig-jagging flight while the weapon hits pieces of debris behind it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How do you intend to avoid getting hit on the final approach?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I haven't figured that part out yet.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper is leaving the debris field; the active Stargate is ahead. With the weapons fire close, the <i>Daedalus</i> moves into position between the Jumper and the planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
It's a good thing we stopped by to check your progress, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Make a break for the Stargate. We'll run interference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Copy that, Daedalus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(to navigator)<br />
Stand by to engage sub-light engines on my mark.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Recommend you go into hyperspace as soon as we go through. There's going to be a big bang.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Understood.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE ABOVE DORANDA</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper goes through the 'gate. <i>Daedalus</i> enters hyperspace just as the entire planet explodes.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS 'GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla arrive carrying their sacks of seed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Take this grain to the storage room.</blockquote>
<p>[She hands if off.]
</p><p>[Above them in the observation area, McKay and Weir argue. Teyla and Ronon overhear them, exchanging concerned looks.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
&#8230;everybody on this base. You are the smartest man we have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You knew there was a question about what you were doing. And you put your life and other people's lives at risk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You destroyed three-quarters of a solar system!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, five-sixths. It's not an exact science.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, give your ego a rest for one second?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard sees McKay and turns the other way.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, Colonel. Colonel! I've been looking all over for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I heard.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns to face him, crossing his arms.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I suppose I deserve that. Look, I just, um&#8230;I wanted to apologize about what happened. I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I wanted to assure you that I intend on being right again, about everything, effective immediately.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard smirks at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That was a joke.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good one.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard turns and steps into the transporter. Rodney rushes forward.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've already apologized to Elizabeth.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard reluctantly remains.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And Radek and&#8230;and I thanked Colonel Caldwell for caring enough to spy on the experiment from orbit. Sent him a nice little e-mail, actually. But I saved you till last because, um&#8230; Honestly, I would&#8230;I would hate to think that recent events might have permanently dimmed your faith in my abilities&#8230; Or your trust. At the very least, I hope I can&#8212;I can earn that back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That may take a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(saddened)<br />
I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(smiling)<br />
But&#8230; I'm sure you can do it, if you really, really try.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard activates the transporter controls, and the doors close. McKay smiles briefly, then sighs with some sadness.]
