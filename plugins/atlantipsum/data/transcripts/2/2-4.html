<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Several Marines are guarding the Stargate, which stands in the open on a grassy hillside. There is smoke rising from the trees in the background and evidence of burnt buildings in front of the gate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and two marines are making their way through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. I'm about ready to call this one. Doesn't look like there are any survivors.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[In another part of the forest, Teyla, Lorne and a Marine are walking past the remains of a settlement.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The cullings are getting more and more intense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
You said it yourself&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and two marines are making their way through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Too many Wraith woke up at the same time. Too many mouths to feed, or hands to feed.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[In another part of the forest, Teyla, Lorne and a Marine are walking past the remains of a settlement.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We're heading back to the 'gate. Meet you there?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Beckett and Cadman are walking across the field.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Sounds like a plan. McKay, Beckett, you having any luck?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Negative, Colonel. We haven't found anyone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Make your way back to the 'gate.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and two marines are making their way through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Will do. Beckett out.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay, Beckett and Cadman are walking across the field.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
So, maybe you should pick some wild flowers from around here. I think she'd get a kick out of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
You've got a date tomorrow night with Katie Brown, right? She's a botanist. She never gets to go off-world.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What's this now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's nothing. Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(snickering)<br />
You have a date, Rodney? With a woman?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(testily)<br />
It is simply two adults sharing some friendly&#8230; Yes, with a woman!</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Well, she's excited about it. I'm not sure why, though.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How would you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Girls' poker night. I know a lot of things, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And I'm sure it is none of your business. This is inappropriate field conversation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
What? I was just suggesting you might want to pick flowers.</blockquote>
<p>[A buzzing can be heard in the distance.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, and maybe you should just do your job, which is to protect us&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Shut up.</blockquote>
<p>[The buzzing getting louder.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Shut up? Let me tell you something&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Hey, stop speaking!</blockquote>
<p>[They stop and listen.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Dart.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard stops to listen to Cadman's report.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(over radio)<br />
We have a Dart incoming.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[In another part of the forest, Teyla, Lorne and the Marine break into a run
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Cadman signals to Beckett and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Move it!</blockquote>
<p>[The three break into a run.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard signals to the Marines to run.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If it's seen us, it'll blow Atlantis' cover.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Lorne are running through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Anyone get a clear shot, you take it. Understand?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;OPEN AREA ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Cadman, Beckett and McKay are running across the open space together. The Dart is in the sky behind them, heading in the same direction. Cadman pushes Beckett out of the way and he falls to the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Scatter!</blockquote>
<p>[As Beckett lies on the ground, McKay and Cadman continue running. The Dart activates its beam and both of them are caught and disappear. Beckett watches the Dart fly away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate activates, the Marines are on alert and Sheppard takes up a position directly in front of the open wormhole.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla, Lorne and the other Marine enter the clearing. As the Dart flies overhead, Teyla and the Marine fire their P-90s at it. Lorne fires the rocket launcher he has been carrying on his shoulder, but the shot hits a tree.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
It is heading towards the gate.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A Marine is pacing in front of the Stargate.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
We damaged it, but it is still on its way.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett comes running across the clearing.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Wait! McKay and Cadman have been beamed aboard that Dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We can't risk the Dart making it back to the Hive ship.</blockquote>
<p>[The Dart flies directly towards the Stargate and Sheppard and the Marines open fire. Smoke pours from one of the Dart's engines as it careens towards the hillside and Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, God.</blockquote>
<p>[Narrowly missing Beckett who throws himself to the ground, the Dart crashes on the hilltop. Sheppard and the Marines run towards the crash site. Beckett lifts himself from the dirt and surveys the burning wreckage in front of him.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;STARGATE CLEARING ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[As Beckett approaches the smoking wreckage of the crashed Dart, the cockpit opens. Beckett raises his sidearm and walks slowly towards the ship. The Wraith at the controls is badly injured. As Beckett and the Wraith exchange looks, Beckett lowers his gun and raises his other hand in a gesture of conciliation.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm a doctor. I can help.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith reaches towards the control panel of the Dart. As it does so, it is hit by a barrage of gunfire. Sheppard and the Marines have arrived on the scene.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What the hell do you think you're doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He was reaching for the self-destruct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's the only one that could get Cadman and McKay out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I seriously doubt he'd oblige.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla, Lorne and the Marine arrive at the scene.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, we'll never know now, will we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is everyone all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're fine. Hansen, radio Atlantis. I want Zelenka here ASAP. We've got a problem.</blockquote>
<p>[Later. The crash site is ringed by Marines as a group of scientists work on the Dart.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard approaches where Beckett and Zelenka are working at the back of the Dart. They have a laptop computer wired into the wreckage. Sparks suddenly start flying as Zelenka performs an operation on the computer and he jumps in fright.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
First time off-world?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(nervously)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if there were any more Wraith, they would have attacked us by now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If it makes you feel better. Did you find what we want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Uh, well, yes, but it's very complex. This interface controls the machine that dematerializes people, stores their information, and then rematerializes them again when commanded to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great. Command it to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Uh, I can't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
From what we can tell the materializer is storing two life-signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which is good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes, but there is only enough power in the Dart's energy cell to successfully re-materialize one of them.</blockquote>
<p>[The computer screen shows two white blips.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Power to the re-materializer has been completely severed, and emergency backup power is completely run down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You have to decide which one we are going to beam out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's a terrible choice to have to make.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's easy. Beam out McKay. He'll figure it out how to get Cadman free.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
No. No, sorry. I was unclear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There's no way of telling which is which.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. They just read as life-signs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Perfect.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard regards the screen for a moment then points.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, that one. Go.<br />
(to the people standing nearby)<br />
Stand aside.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone stands back from the rear of the Dart. As Zelenka performs an operation on the computer, the re-materialization beam activates and McKay appears.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Rodney, you okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay faints and Beckett rushes to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
His pulse is stable but I need to get him back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla and Lorne, help the doc get back to the city with McKay. I'll stay here with Zelenka and try and bring as much of the Dart back as possible.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla, Beckett and Lorne struggle to lift McKay.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay is still unconscious, now lying in a hospital bed under a scanner with electrodes attached to his head.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All of his vitals are stable. His body's reacting like he's been struck by a Wraith stunner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So you think once the initial shock is over, we'll have the old McKay back?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm afraid so.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Weir smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Have they had any luck with the wreckage?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No. Lieutenant Cadman is still in there somewhere. Did you know her well?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, not really. She's with the new batch that came aboard the Daedalus. She seemed quite lovely, though. She saved my life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, you'll be the first person I call when we find her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir leaves the infirmary.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS HANGAR</b>
</p><p>[A scientist is removing the materializer interface from the remains of the Dart. Several other scientists work on various things around the hangar.]
</p>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST<br />
Ugh!<br />
(mutters in German).</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it coming?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, the good news is we were able to stabilize her life-sign signature. Now it's just a question of getting the machine on-line again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great. How do we power it up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, that's the bad news. The machine uses a very specialized transformer to convert raw power into highly stable, very specific stream of power. Now, the transformer's crucial in operating the machine safely, and, uh, it's been
damaged.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka shows Sheppard a container holding several pieces of twisted, charred metal.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't suppose there are any spares in the trunk?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We're working on reverse-engineering one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good. Let me know the second you have something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(gives instruction to the other scientists in Czech)</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS</b>
</p><p>[Ronon is eating a large plate of food with his fingers. Sheppard enters the mess and sits at the table opposite him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not bad, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, what do you think of Atlantis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Have you thought about what you want to do after you're done here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Do you want me to leave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, no. Stay as long as you like. I'm just saying, uh, you know your way around. You can take care of yourself in a fight. You hate the Wraith as much as we do.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon looks at him pointedly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, maybe more than we do. The point is, we could use a guy like you around here and you look like you could use a place to
stay.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon casts a look over his shoulder at the Marine guarding him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm not sure I fit in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's only one way to find out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Do I have to decide now, or can I finish eating?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Take your time. And, uh&#8230;<br />
(offering a knife and fork)<br />
&#8230;try these. They work great.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes the cutlery from Sheppard and resumes eating.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay wakes with a groan. Beckett, who has been tending to another patient, comes to his bedside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hello. Oh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
How are you feeling, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Um&#8230; terrible. What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You were scooped up by a Dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, great. How'd I get out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a long story, but I'm glad to see you're doing well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Hello? Dr. Beckett?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Is that Cadman?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Dr. McKay?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks around the infirmary.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where is she?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
I'm right here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped in the Dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who said that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You said "what?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I said Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. Did you just say the word "what?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, I didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm right here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, I'm talking to Cadman. Shut up for a second.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
She's not here, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Yes, I am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You didn't just hear that? You didn't just hear Lieutenant Cadman?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No, I didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Head set!<br />
(checks his ears)<br />
Not wearing a head set.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
McKay, where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm right in front of Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Oh, no. Put your hands over your eyes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Just do it!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart, and I think maybe you're experiencing some sort of&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay puts his hands over his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, what are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Oh, this is terrible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's terrible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
I can see that. I can see your hands over your eyes as if they were my eyes.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay uncovers his eyes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carson. Hi.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hello.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who got us out of the Dart?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Zelenka. But he only got you out. Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
This cannot be happening.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Cadman's not trapped in the Dart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pointing at his head)<br />
She's in here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS HANGAR</b>
</p><p>[McKay takes a piece of metal from the box holding the remains of the power transformer. Sheppard, Weir and Beckett are looking on.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, nice work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We were running out of power. I knew hardly anything about the machine. Who would have thought this could be one of the side effects?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So instead of waiting to understand what it was that you were doing you just sort of mashed on the keyboard, hoping something would happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
You're alive, aren't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Ask him if he knows how to fix it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He doesn't know how to fix it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(pointing at his head)<br />
Talking to her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So you can hear her thoughts?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, not her thoughts, thank God. I can hear when she's speaking, or when, I suppose, she's trying to speak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you sure he should have been discharged from the infirmary Carson?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
According to the MRI, he's as healthy as he ever was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
It doesn't feel very healthy in here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, we can't all be track stars, now, can we?<br />
(to the others present)<br />
It was her again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe there's something wrong an MRI wouldn't pick up, if you know what I mean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not crazy. I just have another consciousness in my brain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So he just looks crazy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm sure I do, but only because Dr. Fumbles McStupid over here was in way over his head.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes. Yes! I made a mistake trying to save your life! Now, do you want to try to fix it or do you want to continue to berate me some more?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I am perfectly capable of doing both at the same time. Now, I assume you've tried to run one of our own generators&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
It's not as simple as that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Why not?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
The trick is having it interface with the Wraith machine in real time. The power fluctuations are, are huge. If we overshoot just a little&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Wait. What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
&#8230;we're screwed up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, okay. I'm sure if maybe we can write an interface program that can take care of all&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Hello? Rodney? Will you please answer me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here's what I want us to try.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We'll take a, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A naquadah generator&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shouting)<br />
Yes! What?</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks at McKay in surprise.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />

</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks off down the corridor.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS HANGAR</b>
</p><p>[A scientist puts a plastic box containing two white mice on a table. Sheppard and Weir look at them curiously as Zelenka shows McKay the work on his computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
We've been running simulations all day. I think I may finally have something. I was able to get the generator to run on a buffer loop, which tricks the Dart into taking only the power that it needs without overloading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Mm. Great. Good thinking. Now, can we just see it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Anxious?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. Firing.</blockquote>
<p>[The Dart materializer unit is mounted in front of the table and fires a beam at the mice, which disappear from the box.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right. Life-signs holding steady. Now, re-materialization initiated.</blockquote>
<p>[The beam fires again. Everyone has a look of disgust on their faces. The box contains two charred, smoking black mice.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Now, I'm no scientist, but those mice used to be a different color.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is never going to end. I'm going to be stuck like this forever.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, SUNRISE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir is walking around the control room making notes on a tablet while Sheppard follows her.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm not sure it's a good idea, John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Elizabeth, you've got to see this guy in action. He is an incredible shot. None of my guys could beat him in a fight, and he's ex-military.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, not a military on Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, look, the guy's got no place to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're not just being charitable?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No. I'm not, and I think he'd make a great addition to my team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We don't know anything about him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, what's there to know?</blockquote>
<p>[Weir leaves the control room and towards her office where people are waiting for her. Sheppard follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, anything would be helpful. He's not very forthcoming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's been on the run from the Wraith for the past seven years. What do you expect? Look. Listen. Just talk to the guy. You owe him that, at least.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir goes into her office and Sheppard walks away with a slightly worried look on his face.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS, HEIGHTMEYER'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[McKay sits opposite Heightmeyer on a sofa. McKay has is face in his hands then takes them away and looks up with an angry expression. McKay and Cadman are both speaking with McKay's voice, but he turns his head to the side when it's Cadman speaking.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as McKay)<br />
I would like an apology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Laura?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
Forget about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
You did take over his body without permission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
He doesn't ask permission when he takes over.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as McKay)<br />
You&#8230; because it's my body!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
Yeah, and I'm a guest. Try and be a little more courteous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as McKay)<br />
You see? Do you see what I have to put up with?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
"Put up with?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as McKay)<br />
(angrily)<br />
There's a lot of stuff that I am not doing right now that I would be doing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
I don't want to hear about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
All right, you two. Settle down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
Huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Would you&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS, GYM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon is teaching a group of Marines some knife fighting techniques. One of the Marines feigns attack and he goes through a series of moves.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Thigh. Strip. Cut. Lift. Cut. And finish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARINE<br />
Awesome.</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens and Weir enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ronon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can I have a word?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon hands one of the Marines the practice knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon walks over to Weir. He folds his arms and waits for her to speak.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I understand Major Sheppard extended an invitation to you to join his team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, he did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, he was supposed to speak to me about that first.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look, it's not that I don't trust you, or value any contributions you may have to make. Or that you will make, if you do join us, it's just&#8230; it is a rather big decision.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon doesn't answer.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So how do you feel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm thinking about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. Good. Well, I'm thinking about it, too. So I guess we'll just keep in touch, then.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon turns and goes back to the training session.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir watches as Ronon resumes his training.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
All right. Dismembering a defeating arm. Two knives. Slice. Cut.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're the one who said set up rules. Well, I did. I followed them. I stuck to them! She basically hijacked me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
Hey. You had a real opportunity to get inside the mind of a woman and actually expand your horizons. But, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(becoming frantic)<br />
Did you ever, for a second, consider that I might not want to get inside a woman's&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Rodney starts having convulsions.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
Rodney? Rodney!</blockquote>
<p>[Heightmeyer lies McKay on the floor then runs to the intercom.]
</p>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
This is Heightmeyer. Get Beckett in here stat!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay passes out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[McKay wakes up in a bed in the infirmary. Beckett, Zelenka and Heightmeyer are standing by his bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You had a seizure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
From what we can tell, the constant fighting over the dominance of your brain is having a deleterious effect on its lower functions. Heart rate, respiration, organ function&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
And that's not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course it's not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not sure how long you can go on like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
These misfires will only increase in frequency and severity with time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fine. She'll stop trying to take control of my body.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's not as simple as that, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
One of you has to release control. One of you has to let go completely.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, well, maybe if someone, say you, hadn't told her to try and take control in the first place, none of this would've happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HEIGHTMEYER<br />
I was just trying to help both of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What happens to the person, the one who "lets go"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, we're not certain, of course. It's not like we've run into a lot of these situations before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
They would disappear. I know they would, because I can already feel it happening to me. It's getting harder to be in here. It's taking more of an effort.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Has it always been like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
The past few hours. You haven't felt it too?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course I have, but I just thought I was fighting with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
Look, where are we at?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, we successfully re-materialized a pair of mice. They were whole and correctly reconstructed&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
They didn't survive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm afraid that if one of you doesn't let go, both of you will die.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'll do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Which one of you said that?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay doesn't answer.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and Heightmeyer are off to one side of the room, talking. McKay lies in bed, talking with Cadman.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You don't have to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Yes, I do, Rodney. It's your body, and you're not going to do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, what makes you so sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
They need you here, and as much as I hate to admit it, I'm not as important as&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Stop it. That's not true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(as Cadman)<br />
Carson? I need something to write with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
I'm going to write a letter to my folks. I'd appreciate it if you delivered it yourself the next time you gate back to Earth, Rodney. Explain what happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I'm not sure when I'll&#8230; The gate. We can use the gate!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The gate dematerializes you as you step into it, sending your information to the next gate so it can re-materialize you on the other side.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
We know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(becoming excited)<br />
If we can take one of the crystal control modules from the gate and interface it with the Dart, we should be able to build a stable system.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to get out of bed but Beckett stops him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Rodney, wait. I don't think you're in any condition to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't have time to talk. I need to get this done before the next seizure.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gets out of bed and runs off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS HANGAR</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka looks on while McKay, still in scrubs but wearing a robe over them, places crystal in a control module which is wired up to the Dart module.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
All right, let's do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, just because it works in simulation doesn't mean&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I would prefer not to suffer a fatal seizure while we wait for you to round up more mice for testing, so, shall we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't try and talk me out of this. I may very well listen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
I was just going to say, "thanks".</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you're welcome. I can honestly say that the entire experience has been very, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett, Weir and Sheppard arrive.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ah. About time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hold on, Rodney. I thought all the mice died.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what are we, mice or men?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you sure about this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Absolutely. Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone looks very concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Just give me a sec.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay steps into the beam target area.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, Laura, it's been, um&#8230; unique.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
To say the least.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good luck us both, hmm?</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka punches keys on the computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
All right. It's ready.<br />
(to the others)<br />
I suggest you take a step back.<br />
(to the computer)<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay raises a finger.]
</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Wait!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks over the Beckett, takes him by the lapels and kisses him.]
</p>

(as Cadman)<br />
Just in case this doesn't work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(stepping back to the target area)<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; just&#8230; just&#8230; Hit it.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka hits a button, the beam fires and McKay disappears. The computer screen shows two blips.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. It's reading as two life-signs. Power levels are steady&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get 'em out of there.</blockquote>
<p>[Zelenka hits another button, the two blips disappear from the screen and both McKay and Cadman re-materialize in the beam target area. They both fall to the floor, unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Let's get them to the infirmary.</blockquote>

Yes, I did. Chatty fellow, isn't he?</blockquote>

And?</blockquote>

He would be your responsibility.</blockquote>

I knew you'd say yes.</blockquote>

I haven't said yes.</blockquote>

Yes.</blockquote>

There you go.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Feeling better?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks at the empty bed to his left.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
(voice)<br />
Over here&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns to the right, where Cadman is lying in a bed, waving at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Um&#8230; a little less crowded. You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Same. It's nice to have my own body back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're doing supremely well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, good to hear.<br />
(to Zelenka)<br />
Nice work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Well, it was your idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, of course it was, but you&#8230; you were&#8230; there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(To Cadman)<br />
Lieutenant, way to survive what I think may be my worst nightmare.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Thank you, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I imagine you two might want a moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CADMAN<br />
Actually, Ma'am, I think I'd like some time alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Same here. It's, um, it's been a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
All right, release them as soon as you can.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone walks away, Beckett giving Cadman's hand a squeeze before he goes. Cadman smiles at McKay and he smiles uncomfortably back.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hey.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay turns his head away and sighs heavily.]
