<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS MESS HALL</b>
</p><p>[While eating, Ronon watches two science crewman playing chess. Weir enters with a tray of food and sees him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
May I join you?</blockquote>
<p>[He gestures yes, and she sits beside him, so they both have a view of the chess match.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's called chess. It's a game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They've been sitting there like that since I sat down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Those two, they play every single day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Neither one of them has even blinked yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, it's not really a game of&#8230;action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I can see that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's all about strategy. He's planning his next move&#8230;and the move after that&#8230;and the move after that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You guys do a lot of that around here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, we do. I take it that's not how you prefer to do things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No. I'm leaving.</blockquote>
<p>[He stands up and picks up his tray.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey, Ronon, wait.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Look, just because we do things differently doesn't mean we can't learn from each other. And Colonel Sheppard has already invested an incredible amount of time and energy trying to make you an integral part of his team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I mean I'm leaving the table.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(embarrassed)<br />
Oh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is that okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I thought that&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Dr. Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Rodney, what is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Something you should see here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm on my way.</blockquote>
<p>[She stands up.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm leaving too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Standing beside a large Atlantis display, McKay briefs Sheppard and Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That is the signature of an Ancient ship called the <i>Aurora</i>. With the ZPM now powering the city, we've been reactivating dormant systems. That one tracked the location of Ancient ships during the war.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(interested)<br />
A warship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, see, look at his eyes, all lighting up again. It's Pavlovian. I crosschecked the logs. They were on a reconnaissance mission.</blockquote>
<p>[He steps up to another display.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
When we activated the ZPM, the city must have sent out some kind of an automated subspace beacon, recalling ships back to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How long before it gets here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, given that it's at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy&#8230; Let me see, carry the four&#8230; 42 million years. Should we go wait on the porch?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So we take a jumper through the nearest Stargate and check it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Clever, but wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There are no nearby Stargates.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not within jumper distance, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Which leaves us only one way to get there.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay walks beside Caldwell.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Please don't force me to remind you that I do have discretionary power to utilize the <i>Daedalus</i>&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'm well aware of the extent of your powers, Dr. Weir, and they end at the hatch of this ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel, do we have to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Relax, Doctor. I happen to agree. The value of an Ancient warship in our hands instead of the Wraith's is more than enough incentive for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good. Colonel Sheppard's team is ready to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
My crew can handle this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
My team is far more experienced with Ancient technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(insistent)<br />
My people will only get that kind of experience by going on this kind of a mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(commanding)<br />
Not this mission. We discovered it, we check it out. Your crew can cut their teeth on something else.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Fine. Have Colonel Sheppard's team ready to go in an hour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They're ready now.</blockquote>
<p>[They arrive at the bridge to find the Atlantis team waiting, Sheppard eating a power bar. Caldwell looks with annoyance at Weir, who smiles smugly.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Daedalus</i> drops out of hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at a display)<br />
We should have visual soon.</blockquote>
<p>[He joins the others at the forward view-screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
(at starboard station)<br />
Sir, I'm detecting a second ship.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay walks back to a display, currently manned.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Move.</blockquote>
<p>[The crewman steps away.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Looks like a small Wraith vessel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A dart?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, bigger. Some sort of a scout ship, probably after the same thing we are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PILOT<br />
(at port station)<br />
It's altering course coming straight at us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Must've seen us drop out of hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Weapons range?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Five seconds&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The display shows the ship come into range.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Target is locked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Fire.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> fires missiles.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The display shows the missiles hit the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Target is destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All these years, and just now the Wraith find this ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, all these years, the <i>Aurora</i> lay dormant. The signal from Atlantis woke it up, making it visible to the Wraith as well as us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(looking out view-screen)<br />
Is that it?</blockquote>
<p>[The ship becomes visible.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[<i>Aurora</i> is very large but has massive damage all along its hull.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Looks like it was in a hell of a fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
And lost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Life support?</blockquote>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Negative, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Looks like you're going to have to suit up, Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks startled at the prospect.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On our way.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team is beamed into the ship. They are wearing their orange space suits.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We should be just outside the bridge.</blockquote>
<p>[The shine their flashlights around the room. They find a door and activate the control to open it. Behind is the bridge, its view-screen broken and the whole room exposed to space.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You mean what used to be the bridge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel Sheppard&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[They see what she has found &#8212; a large room with stacks of stasis pods. There are human-looking beings inside them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Stasis pods. They're still powered up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Stasis?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We found a similar pod on Atlantis. It keeps a person alive for many years in a type of frozen hibernation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, if you call that "living."</blockquote>
<p>[McKay examines a pod with an elderly man inside.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This one's uniform is different from the others. Maybe the Captain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Or the maitre d'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Life-sign indicators are active. These capsules must have some kind of a shielding. That's why the <i>Daedalus'</i>s sensors were unable to pick them up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Look at all of them.</blockquote>
<p>[She looks up at level after level of pods above them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's just on this deck. Who knows how many more there are on the rest of this ship.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Look, our time in these suits is limited. Can you get life support up and running?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm on it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay steps away. Sheppard rubs the frost off the pod of the old man.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p><i>[Caldwell speaks to Sheppard by radio. The scene switches between the two ships.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
They're all alive? The entire crew?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[Life support is on, and Sheppard's team has taken off their space suits. McKay is studying the pod system with his laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, they're in a kind of suspended animation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not entirely suspended, however. The pod has slowed their aging considerably, but the bodies are virtually moribund.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla and Ronon are searching the rest of the ship. My guess is there's hundreds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Is there anything we can do for them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, reviving them’s out of the question. The pod’s the only thing keeping them alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What are we going to do with them, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's something going on. This pod is magnetically shielded. I'm reading cortical signals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which means&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excitedly)<br />
The pod's equipped with a neural interface that's indicating definite brain activity, as though he were perfectly conscious. If all of these pods are interconnected, it's highly possible that these people are, in fact, communicating with each other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
This has been going on for ten thousand years?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Possibly. It's their way of keeping their minds occupied until they were rescued.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That is one long conversation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, more likely, the interface was reactivated when the recall beacon from Atlantis was received.<br />
(looking at his tablet)<br />
Either way, the neuro-feedback loop is incredibly active.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Any way to figure out what they're saying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically, holding up his tablet)<br />
Yes, of course. It says right here. "Why is the smart one having to stop and answer so many questions?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
It's a fair question, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Of course it is. Being able to communicate with a living Ancient is the opportunity of a lifetime, but this system is a highly complex system, which I will have&#8212; Wait a minute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Answering your question.<br />
(activating his radio)<br />
Teyla, found any more of the pods?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes. Many. And there are many more decks we have yet to search.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are any of the pods empty?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
A few.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at a dubious Sheppard)<br />
Perfect.</blockquote>
<p>EXT&#8212;space
</p><p>[<i>Aurora</i> floats in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[The team has gathered around an empty pod.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure this is such a good idea?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens a pod; the platform slides out from the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's the matter, Colonel? Don't trust me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(snarky)<br />
Fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
You're proposing actually freezing yourself in one of those things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I should be able to tap into the neural network without actually initializing stasis.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Listening, Caldwell appears pained at the prospect.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(over radio)<br />
Look, it won't take long. I'll be in and out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[Sheppard looks at McKay with a dubious expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, the quickest way to figure out what is going on in there is to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain. Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
But is it safe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Which is exactly what makes it safe enough for me to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Better to have you on the outside in case something goes wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It won't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But if it does.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to take off his vest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It won't! How many times do I have to say this!?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney, between the two of you, if something were to go wrong, which would be the greater loss?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I've never thought of it that way, but&#8230; Hey, she's right. You should go.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard looks at Teyla, who smiles mildly.]
</p><p>[Later, Sheppard is lying on the platform as the team looks on, McKay with his laptop connected to the pod.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Now, remember, the system creates a direct feedback loop between the processor and your brainwaves. So when you want to disconnect, you'll need to, well, really concentrate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean think it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I think it'll probably take a little more than that, otherwise you'd be popping in and out of the thing every time it crossed your mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So&#8230;there's no place like home?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If that works for you. Now, I should be able to monitor your EEG pattern, so in the highly unlikely event that something anomalous should present itself, I should be able to disconnect you manually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Without <i>permanent</i> brain damage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(startled)<br />
Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, the opportunity to speak to a living Ancient is worth the risk, hmm? Now, when I close the lid, the pod's systems should activate. Ready?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay activates the pod on his laptop. It slides into the wall, and the upper covering lowers over Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard becomes aware inside a representation of a brightly lit, undamaged <i>Aurora</i>. He is wearing a white Ancient uniform. He looks down at himself, then starts to walk. He looks at the ship around him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is weird.</blockquote>
<p>[A door slides open, and a young man comes through.]
</p>
<blockquote>CREWMAN<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard. I'm part of an expedition&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The crewman points a weapon at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>CREWMAN<br />
This deck is restricted. How did you get in here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My team discovered your ship. Your crew was in a stasis pod. We decided to tap into the&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CREWMAN<br />
Stay where you are.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Security to engineering deck.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, you don't need to call security&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CREWMAN<br />
Stay where you are.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, Sheppard walks down a corridor with the crewman and two guards.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> BRIDGE IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p><p>[The crewman leads Sheppard onto the bridge. A woman approaches the male in the Captain's chair. She is the First Officer.]
</p>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
They hyperdrive construct modifications are commencing, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Make certain the equations are entered in the correct sequence. We don't want to overload the control conduit.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard watches the interchange with interest, smiling at the woman.]
</p>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Is this him?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CREWMAN<br />
Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
You wear the uniform of my crew, but I don't know you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
My name's Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard. We discovered your ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We found you and your crew in the stasis pods. We decided to tap into the system in order to communicate with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
"System?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This. This uh,&#8230;virtual reality.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone exchanges skeptical glances, clearly not understanding what Sheppard is talking about.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You do know this is kind of simulated&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The First Officer looks confused. Sheppard notes the guards standing behind him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is there someplace more private we can talk?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> BRIG IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p><p>[The jail door closes, locking Sheppard in. The Captain and First Officer stand outside.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(annoyed)<br />
It's not exactly what I meant by "private."</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
I want to know who you are and how you got aboard this ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I told you, my name's Colonel John Sheppard, part of an expedition&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
What expedition?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let me bottom-line this for you. We came from Atlantis except it's not quite the Atlantis you remember. Ten thousand years have gone by since you left. I know all of this sounds strange, but I'm telling you the truth. Right now, you're all in your stasis pods aboard <i>Aurora</i>. The ship's been derelict for centuries. None of this is real. I expected you to know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
You don't have time to bother with this nonsense. The hyperdrive modifications are much more pressing, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What kind of hyperdrive modifications?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
We're attempting to modify our propulsion in order to return to Atlantis as quickly as possible. Then we'll see if you're speaking the truth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Oh, look. The Atlantis you know doesn't exist anymore. During the war with the Wraith, the city was evacuated back to Earth&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Evacuate? Why would we do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sir&#8230;the war was lost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
(growing angry)<br />
Nothing is lost. Not yet. I have vital information concerning a weakness in Wraith technology, and when I deliver the communiqué in my possession, the tide will most certainly turn in our favor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's right&#8212; the Atlantis mission logs said you were on a recon mission. What kind of weakness are we talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
That information is reserved for the Council.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There is no Council anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
Sir, we must return to the bridge.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn to leave but Sheppard speaks more loudly to get their attention.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wait. According to the logs the <i>Aurora</i> left Lantian space during the siege. That means the city had already been sunk to the bottom of the ocean. You're wondering, how could I know that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because that's where it was when we found it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
We're wasting time, sir. You need to attend to the hyperdrive.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn and leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wait! The information in that communiqué could still be incredibly valuable to us.</blockquote>
<p>[Left alone, Sheppard starts to concentrate on breaking the link. He opens his eyes to find he hasn't left yet. He concentrates harder.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's pod slides out, the canopy opening.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, of course it worked.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
For a minute, I thought I was going to get stuck there. Where's Teyla and Ronon?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, Caldwell sent them to search the ship's armory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No. Unfortunately, it was depleted of drones. Look, so, what happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Were you able to communicate with the Captain?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Face to face. Pretty impressive in there. They have a whole virtual reality thing going on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, the correct term is "virtual environment."</blockquote>

Because I didn't know what that would do to <i>you</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's very thoughtful of you, but now she knows all about Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You told her?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay crosses his arms suspiciously, as if accusing Sheppard of falling for the first officer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Because I was trying to convince them that&#8212; Just go and unplug the Wraith while I talk to the Captain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The communiqué is blank.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, but he might still have some intel about the Wraith weakness. Now, Rodney, is there anything else you'd like to tell me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sheepishly)<br />
Only that Caldwell is probably going to destroy this ship at any moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Go!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Going.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves the environment. Sheppard runs off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[McKay's pod opens.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teyla? Ronon? Oh, I can't believe it. Two minutes in the pod, I'm abandoned. Come on.<br />
(struggling to get up)<br />
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh&#8230; Right. Okay.</blockquote>
<p>[He grabs his tablet and runs, limping from an apparent cramp in his leg.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard climbs a ladder to the corridor just outside the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Come on, McKay&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
Hyperdrive modification commands have been successfully entered. Auxiliary power is now online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Very good. Prepare to engage drive.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rushes in, weapon drawn.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stop! Your First Officer is a Wraith. She's using you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
Security to the bridge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She gained access to the virtual environment by killing your First Officer and taking her place. She's getting you to modify your hyperdrive so she can upgrade the Wraith hyperdrives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
Don't listen to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They need to modify their hyperdrives to make it to my planet, Earth, and I prefer she not do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
This is nonsense.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm telling you she's a Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Officer Trebal has served with me for many years. I can't possibly believe&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FIRST OFFICER<br />
Sir, with your permission, I'd like to&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Her body starts to fade out, the entire reality showing static.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[McKay works on disconnecting the Wraith's pod.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on&#8230; Disable.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p><p>[The first officer's face begins to alternate between Wraith and Auroran before finally disappearing. The captain is in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hope that was proof enough.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ha!</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith's pod opens.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, no.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pulls his pistol and approaches the Wraith, who wakes up and startles him. McKay starts firing badly as he retreats.]
</p><p>[McKay makes his way to Sheppard's pod and re-loads his pistol.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Come on, come on&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He rushes to his laptop.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
All this time, I thought we had evaded the enemy. Instead, I've been unwittingly assisting them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, sir, she didn't succeed. And if you tell me the information in the communiqué, we may be able to defeat the Wraith once and for all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
The information is in the ship's computer. I can give you my access codes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We checked. It's all been erased. Can't you tell me yourself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
I'm afraid I was never made aware of the its contents, Colonel Sheppard. 
The Council feared the possibility of our capture was too great. The information in that communiqué is gone.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard shakes his head in disappointment.]
</p>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
Ten thousand years&#8230; Even in stasis, our physical bodies must be&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Very old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Too old.</blockquote>
<p>[The captain looks around the bridge at his crew.]
</p>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
My crew deserves to know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, they do, and I'd love to give you all the time in the world for that, but right now, there are two Wraith ships on the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
We've longed for nothing more than returning to Atlantis&#8230;to raise a toast to home and victory. We may not return home but we will do whatever we can to ensure that victory. For that, I will need your help.</blockquote>
<p>[The rush off.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i></b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's pod opens.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's about damn time. What'd you do, play a round of golf?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've got serious problems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What happened? Get down!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard has seen the Wraith approaching from behind McKay. Sheppard grabs his pistol and fires at the Wraith, hitting it repeatedly. He gets up and approaches the Wraith, weapon drawn, as does McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That happened. Not so hot now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Our ships are coming. They will retrieve what I have learned. Earth will soon be ours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not if I can help it.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard fires on the Wraith, killing it.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, we're reading two life-signs. I hope that means what I think it means.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Give me one more minute.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We're out of time, Sheppard. The Wraith ships are almost here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
One damn minute, and I can take care of that problem.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The two Wraith ships drop out of hyperspace near the <i>Daedalus</i> and <i>Aurora</i>.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Wraith cruisers just dropped out of hyperspace, sir. They're aware of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Battle stations. Looks like we're going to have fight these guys. Bring main rail guns online.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
<i>Daedalus</i>, this is Sheppard. We're ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Beam them directly onto the bridge.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard arrive on the bridge.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Targets are in range.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sir, we need to get out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
No, we need to eliminate those cruisers. The information&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no. We need to get far away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Captain gave me the <i>Aurora's</i> self-destruct code. He assures me it'll take care of the Wraith ships too, but we have to get clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Bring sub-light engines to military thrust.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PILOT<br />
Military thrust.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> starts to move away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>AURORA</i> VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT</b>
</p><p>[The Captain addresses his crew.]
</p>
<blockquote>CAPTAIN<br />
I have never been more proud than I am this moment. It has been an honor serving with you. And although we may not return to Atlantis, rest assured that the <i>Aurora</i> will be remembered.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Aurora</i> explodes, taking the Wraith cruisers with it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell, McKay and Sheppard watch the explosion somberly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team and Caldwell brief Weir.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We monitored all transmissions from the Wraith cruisers prior to the explosion. They never got a chance to board the <i>Aurora</i> or upload any of the Ancient information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Both cruisers were destroyed in the explosion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's too bad you weren't able to figure out the Wraith weakness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
At least we found out they had one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good work. Thank you, everyone.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone starts to leave, but Sheppard stops them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Before we break up the party, there's something I'd like to do. It might seem a little strange, but I promised to do something when we got home.</blockquote>
<p>[He picks up a bottle of champagne, and Weir steps around her desk with a tray of glasses. Everyone takes a glass.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard opens the bottle and pours for everyone. He raises his glass in a toast, as they all do.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
To the crew of the <i>Aurora</i>.</blockquote>
<p>[The clink their glasses together and drink.]
