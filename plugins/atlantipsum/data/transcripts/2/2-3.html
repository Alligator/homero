<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and Parrish are walking through dense forest. Parrish is excitedly inspecting the plant life while Lorne shines the light of his P-90 around him.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You know, when they told me I'd be traveling to another galaxy, visiting strange new worlds, defending humanity against unimaginable alien threats, this just is not what I pictured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
We could be saving Earth right here, right now, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Oh, yeah? How's that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
Through a greater understanding of the long-term effects of severe ozone depletion on plant life. You may not want to admit it, but it's a real danger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Oh, yeah. Sure. Global warming, Wraith attack&#8230; I see the similarity now. You're right. Yeah, it's great.</blockquote>
<p>[Parrish wanders off a bit.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Hey, not too far, Doc, okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
Oh, not to worry, Major. I don't think there's much chance any animal could survive the long-term effects of exposure to the sunlight on this planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
So, not a place to build a summer home?</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
(fascinated)<br />
It's the fact this vegetation is thriving.</blockquote>
<p>[Perspective is switched to an overhead view from the tree above them.]
</p>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
Somehow, it's managed to persist despite what should be extremely destructive ionizing radiation.</blockquote>
<p>[Perspective is switched back to ground level.]
</p>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
(excited)<br />
Oh, would you look at that?</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne aims his weapon and prepares to fire in the direction Parrish is looking. Parrish smiles and continues.]
</p>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
(excited)<br />
Now, what is a Williamsonia Sewardiana doing here?</blockquote>
<p>[Parrish walks off towards the plant he had seen. Lorne looks around and notices something on the ground. He shines his light on it and crouches down for a closer look.]
</p>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
Major!</blockquote>
<p>[Parrish is looking at something on the ground and Lorne runs to join him. There is a dead Wraith lying on the ground. There is obvious injury to the body and Lorne checks the blood, which is still wet.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Doesn't look like the sun killed him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
What do we do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Coughlin, this is Lorne. Any activity?</blockquote>
<blockquote>COUGHLIN<br />
(over radio)<br />
No, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
I got a dead sucker here. Looks K.I.A. No more than a day old. We're on our way.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne leaves two glow sticks on the ground by the body.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Come on, Doc. Let's get you back to the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>PARRISH<br />
I&#8230; I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(grabbing Parrish by the shirt)<br />
Well, neither do I. All I know is he didn't do that to himself. Come on, let's go.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk off into the forest and we pan up the tree to see Ford sitting on a branch.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(voice)<br />
Is the gate covered?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(voice)<br />
Coughlin and Reed, yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS, WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Lorne are in Weir's office. Teyla enters and Sheppard and Lorne update her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They found a dead Wraith. Shot several times.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Looked like bullets, but it was hard to say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
The guy was a mess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Genii use such weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Dr. Beckett is performing an autopsy.</blockquote>
<p>[The doors open and Beckett enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Here he is now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not done, not nearly but I thought you might like to know this. The enzyme sac in the right arm has been removed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stunned)<br />
Ford!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(snarkily)<br />
Thanks for coming, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
I was&#8230; I was right in the middle of&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
P-three-M-seven-three-six. We found a dead Wraith&#8230; that may have been killed by Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He could still be there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Wait a second&#8230; seven&#8230; seven-three-six? The UV index there during the day something like a thousand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(firmly)<br />
Bring your sunscreen. Be ready in ten minutes.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(defensively)<br />
What?! I want to get Ford back as much as anyone else, but have you seen my complexion?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(rolling her eyes)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, it's very fair.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Extremely fair.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This isn't fair.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is running along the corridor and as he turns a corner, Caldwell calls after him.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stops with a look of frustration on his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Something urgent?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think we have a bead on Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So I heard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was fast.</blockquote>
<p>[They step into a transporter.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Base protocol dictates all senior officers be notified of situations code orange and above.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard taps the screen behind them, the transporter doors close and there a bright flash of light through the colored glass in the doors.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. How does that go again? Red, orange, blue&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The doors open and they step out of the transporter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
&#8230;or the other way around? You mind if we go over that when I get back?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard is attempting to walk away, but Caldwell follows him up the stairs.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(firmly)<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, you don't have to remind me of our respective positions or that you outrank me, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I was wondering if I needed to remind you. Lieutenant Ford is a significant threat to the security of this base.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He's also a friend in need.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
His condition forces him to seek out the Wraith. If he's caught, he would compromise&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stops walking and turns to face Caldwell on the stairs just below him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I'm going to find him and I'm going to bring him back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
According to Dr. Beckett's report, there may not be anything that can be done to help him.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks down three steps to face Caldwell.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
With all due respect, Sir, I hope you're not saying what I think you're saying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Lieutenant Ford has already proven resourceful enough to penetrate security and escape the city. I am saying if you encounter him and there is any chance whatsoever that his capture might prove elusive, you are duty-bound to eliminate the threat.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard bites his lower lip.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Lieutenant Ford may have been your friend, but he's not anymore. I know you understand. You'll do what's right. You didn't seem to have a problem with mercy when it came to Colonel Sumner.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stares at him, clenching his jaw.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Dismissed.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard walks away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The gate is on the edge of an open grassy area and two soldiers are standing guard. A Puddle Jumper flies through the open wormhole and comes to a stop near the edge of the clearing. We see through the front window that Sheppard and McKay are at the controls, Teyla and Lorne behind them. Sheppard brings up the H.U.D.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Life-signs detector is useless.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I told you so.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER COCKPIT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just preserving your streak of being right. Officially.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dr. Parrish believes that the indigenous plant life retains enough residual radioactivity absorbed during the daylight to, um, well, to screw up our sensors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Making it the perfect place to hide.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gets up and leaves the cockpit.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(calling after Sheppard)<br />
Or the perfect place to be exposed to dangerously high levels of solar radiation!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne goes to the rear of the Puddle Jumper to speak to his men.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Any activity while we were gone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>REED<br />
No, Sir.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard joins them. Behind him, Teyla is gearing up while McKay is applying cream to his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's start a sweep. Teams of two. Radio contact every twenty minutes.<br />
(turning around to face McKay)<br />
How come it smells like I'm on vacation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling)<br />
Could it be the simulated tropical aroma of cocoa butter?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Strong enough for anyone within five miles to smell you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Like they haven't been tipped off by the Aqua Velva?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's dark.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(looking at his watch)<br />
Yeah, well, the sun will be up in two hours, forty-three minutes, and&#8230; ten seconds.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla step out onto the grass.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's raining.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So we'll be cold and miserable. Look, the cloud cover will depreciate a small percentage of UV rays, but ninety-five percent of deadly is still deadly.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay continues applying the cream to his face and neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Dr. Parrish said a day or two of exposure wasn't going to kill us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yes, and Dr. Parrish has a PhD in what? Right. Botany.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Teyla, you're with me, Coughlin, take Billick, Reed, you and Sherman cover the gate, and Major, you've got McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[The others move out, leaving Lorne and McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Oh, lucky me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Here. Try some. SPF one hundred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
A hundred?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can't buy this kind of protection. I make it myself. Waterproof, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p>[They exit the rear of the jumper and head out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The dead Wraith's weapon, several Wraith grenades and a number of glow sticks are lying on the ground where the body was found earlier. Sheppard and Teyla arrive on the scene. Sheppard picks up a grenade and turns it over in his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Do you have any idea what a lone Wraith would be doing around here on foot?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(surveying the area)<br />
No. It is unusual. Perhaps Lieutenant Ford was able to lure him through the gate.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla sees something on the ground and crouches down to investigate.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It looks as if someone might have headed off in this direction.</blockquote>
<p>[They move out.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and McKay are walking through another part of the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So exactly what kind of special training do you guys have to go through to get this sort of mission?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
"You guys"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, you know. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. It's a great place to start.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
And by this mission, you mean hunting down a skilled weapons expert hopped up on Wraith drugs in the pitch black of an alien planet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(snarkily)<br />
Actually, I skipped that course in major school.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I was afraid of that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I was hoping Lieutenant Ford might recognize a friendly face and just turn himself in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What, you mean me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Well, you were friends, weren't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sarcastically)<br />
Oh yeah. When we weren't out on harrowing missions, we used to hang out together. I'd share my dreams of a self-sustaining fusion. He would talk of how you could sever a man's torso with a P-90.</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne stops suddenly and raises one closed hand in the air as a signal.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What, that means "quiet," right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(whispering)<br />
Yeah. Get down, get down.</blockquote>
<p>[They crouch down behind a tree stump.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I thought I saw something move.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and Teyla are making their way through the forest when, suddenly, Teyla stops.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I heard something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(calling out)<br />
Ford? Is that you? It's John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(calling out)<br />
Aiden, listen to me. We want to help you. Please. Just come out. We only want to talk.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear a noise in the forest, raise their weapons and run towards it.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and McKay are still crouched down behind the tree stump. Lorne raises is eyebrows expectantly at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispers)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(quietly)<br />
Say something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Talk to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What if it's not him?</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne grabs McKay by the shoulder and pushes him to his feet.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervously)<br />
Ford? You there? It's your&#8230; best friend Rodney. Rodney McKay. Everyone&#8230; misses you back at Atlantis, and Dr. Beckett's figured out a way to help you, so you've just got to trust me and&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[There is a rustling in the bushes and somebody in the distance moves off into the forest. Lorne pursues him and Rodney follows.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, it's Major Lorne. In pursuit of suspect.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard are running through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
What? So are we. Where are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
We're two klicks south of the Stargate. Where are you?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla runs into a small clearing where she is hit by a red energy weapon blast and falls to the ground. Sheppard stops and points his weapon towards where Teyla fell.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne has stopped running and McKay catches up to him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
I lost him.<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is still standing with his weapon ready.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quietly into radio)<br />
Stand by. Teyla's been hit.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes a few steps forward then is hit by the same red energy weapon blast and falls to the ground in pain.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne and McKay are still standing in the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, say again. What's your position?</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne is becoming concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, please respond.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard are lying motionless on the ground. We see the scene from the perspective of someone walking between them.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, come in, please. Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM BALCONY</b>
</p><p>[Weir is on the balcony. The stargate is active in the gate room below her.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
We haven't heard from them since twenty-six thirty Atlantis Standard Time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I know the life signs detector doesn't work there, Major, but can you use the Jumper to search from the air?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
No, ma'am. The foliage is far too dense for that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'll send another team to assist.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER ON P3M-736</b>
</p><p>[Lorne is in the cockpit speaking to Weir and McKay enters from the rear. Daylight can be seen through the window of the Puddle Jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Well, anyone you could spare would be great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Anything else you need?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
Elizabeth, it's Rodney. Yes, hi. There are four class one radiation suits in med lab storage. We'll need them all.<br />
(to Lorne)<br />
What? Look, I know there's not enough for us all, but we can&#8230; take turns.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay leaves the cockpit.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Any sign of Lieutenant Ford yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Uh, no, Ma'am. Not that we can confirm. The fact is, we don't even know if this is Lieutenant Ford we're dealing with.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;P3M-736 CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard are sitting back-to-back, bound and unconscious. There is a man at the mouth of the cave, searching through their belongings. Sheppard regains consciousness but is clearly disoriented.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford?</blockquote>
<p>[The man turns his face towards Sheppard, but it is not Ford. He looks at Sheppard then returns to his task. Teyla regains consciousness.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My head is pounding. Where are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know, but I was just about to ask him.</blockquote>
<p>[The man stands up and walks towards Sheppard and Teyla. He is carrying a P-90.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You might want to be careful where you point that thing. Looks like you got the safety off.</blockquote>
<p>[The man readies the weapon to fire and points it at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay. Be that way, but my guess is if you wanted us dead, we'd be dead right now, so why don't you tell us who you are and what you want?</blockquote>
<p>[The man just stands looking at Sheppard, the P-90 trained on him.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, I'll go first. I'm Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I am Teyla Emmagan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's my rank. Military designation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Specialist Ronon Dex.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Name and rank.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon returns to where he had left their belongings, drops the P-90 and continues searching.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Military?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I used to be.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SATEDA, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and several other Satedan soldiers are under heavy fire. They are returning fire but they are clearly losing the battle. There are numerous Wraith darts flying through the air.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(yelling to his comrades)<br />
Go! Move, move, move!</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;P3M-736 CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It was a long time ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />

<p>[Sheppard gestures to the top of the outcrop.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll be right up there. Go.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett walk toward the gap in the rock, casting a nervous look back at Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla are standing near the cave. He has his weapon trained on her. Beckett walks into the clearing through the gap in the rock.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Hello. I normally don't make house calls like this, but then again, this isn't really a house, is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's in the case, Doc?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Surgical implements, diagnostic tools, various drugs. Analgesics, antibiotics&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon, Dr. Carson Beckett. Dr. Beckett, Ronon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Pleasure.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett goes to a large rock, puts down his bag and case and begins preparations.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I understand you have some sort of a transmitter in your back. Well, have a seat. Off with your shirt. Let's have a look.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sits on the rock and gestures to Teyla with the weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Little help?</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Beckett help remove Ronon's leather armor. When Teyla removes the front part, she sees a long scar on his chest and a necklace made from a Wraith finger bone. She looks at it, horrified. Meanwhile, Beckett is looking at Ronon's back. There is an area of heavy scarring near the top, right by the spine.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
My God. Tell me you didn't try to cut this thing out yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, I tried once with a mirror. Couldn't quite reach. Most of it's from two different doctors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(appalled)<br />
No one I know who calls himself a doctor would do this.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett takes a hand-held scanner from the case and starts to use it on Ronon's back. Meanwhile, Sheppard is in position on the outcrop above. He has his weapon aimed at Ronon and it watching him through the sight.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Is that Ancestor technology?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That it is.</blockquote>
<p>[The scanner screen shows Ronon's spine and the transmitter embedded beside it.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Son, you're going to have to put that weapon down and lie down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not a chance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Now, you listen to me. I've located the transmitter. It's in the soft tissue next to the second thoracic vertebra.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Good. Cut it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I can't do that with you sitting up like this, and I'm going to have to give you some anesthetic to make you sleep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, you're not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon, you need to trust us.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon points his weapon at Teyla.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I do. That's why he's here and you're still alive. Now, get to work, Doc.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Ford and McKay are still walking through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, if you'd just turn on your radio, we could hear what's happening. The others must have called for backup by now. Maybe Sheppard and Teyla don't even need rescuing anymore.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford pushes McKay behind a tree.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ow!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Shh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ow.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford gives McKay back his sidearm.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Someone's coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What do I need this for?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford walks off, leaving McKay hiding behind the tree.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>There is a light set up and Beckett is wearing a surgical headset with lights, ready to operate.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Okay, I'm ready. Look, I just want to say one last time. I really don't think this is a good idea. I'm going to be cutting very close to your spinal column here. If you were to flinch&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I won't flinch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Okay. Here we go.</blockquote>
<p>Beckett operates to remove the transmitter. Ronon's expression is determined, but he is clearly in agony. He is having trouble holding his gun. Sheppard continues to watch from the top of the outcrop.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I think I've got it.</blockquote>
<p>[He removes the transmitter from Ronon's back and turns to put it in a dish. When he does, Ronon passes out and falls to the ground.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Two Marines are making their way stealthily through the forest. They hear a noise, turn the lights on their weapons off and point them at a spot ahead where McKay jumps out from behind the tree where he had been hiding.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hold it! Don't shoot! It's just me!</blockquote>
<p>[As McKay is standing with his arms raised, the Marines are shot by Wraith stun weapon fire from above. Ford appears.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What the hell are you doing, McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What the hell am I doing? What the hell are you doing? Those are our guys!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I can't trust them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, that's it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay points the handgun at Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, I've had it. Drop your weapons now!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(incredulous)<br />
You're going to shoot me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I will if I have to. Ford, I'm taking you in. Look, you may not believe this, but it's for your own good.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford begins to raise his weapon towards McKay, but McKay fires first, hitting Ford in the upper arm. Ford is seemingly not bothered by the wound, he just touches it. He looks at his bloody fingers for a moment, then stares at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, boy.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay runs off into the forest.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Teyla is crouching beside the still unconscious Ronon. Sheppard has arrived on the scene and is pointing his P-90 at him anyway.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm quite certain I've disabled the device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It may be too late.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla, Sheppard and Beckett walk away from Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We know at least one Wraith tracked Ronon here. I'm going to go look for McKay and Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, we will be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Now that the lion's passed out cold.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going to pick you up with the Jumper as soon as&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Weapons fire can be heard. Sheppard runs to investigate.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[McKay is running through the forest, firing straight up over his head as he goes.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Help me! Help me!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay runs out of bullets and squeals.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 STARGATE CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Lorne is standing guard near the Jumper. The Stargate begins to activate.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Cloak the Jumper! Now!</blockquote>
<p>[Lorne and his men take up positions behind trees near the Jumper and watch as the Stargate activates.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, we got gate activity.</blockquote>
<p>[Three Wraith darts fly from the open wormhole.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is running through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Three Wraith darts just came through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 CAVE CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We should head back inside!</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla and Beckett run back to where they had left Ronon unconscious on the ground, but he is gone. While Beckett goes and picks up a weapon, Teyla checks inside the cave. She comes back out seconds later.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He went through there.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[McKay is still running through the forest. He runs into a small clearing where his foot is caught in a snare and he is lifted into the air, upside-down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You've got to be kidding me!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is running through the forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel, Ronon is gone. There's another way out of the cave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Get back to the Jumper.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[McKay is dangling upside-down as Ford approaches the clearing.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(laughs)<br />
Well, look at you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, look at me. It's funny, huh?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford laughs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Did you set this up? That's clever.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Wasn't me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, huh? Well, I'm glad we can both&#8230; still laugh about this together. Ha, ha&#8230; How about cutting me down now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(smiling)<br />
No.<br />
(serious)<br />
I think I'm still going to kill you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? What do you mean, "still"? When did this escalate to killing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
When you shot me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a flesh wound! I knew it wasn't going to hurt you! You're&#8230; you're SuperFord. Remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(shouting)<br />
You tried to kill me!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford aims his P-90 at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(frantic)<br />
Wait! You can't kill an unarmed upside-down man!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford is crash tackled from the side. As he and Ronon roll on the ground, Ford's gun fires.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard hears the shots and takes off in the direction from which they came.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST CLEARING, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Ford and Ronon are locked in hand-to-hand combat while McKay hangs from the trap, watching helplessly. Sheppard arrives on the scene and aims his weapon at Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Lieutenant!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford stoops to pick up his Wraith weapon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't.</blockquote>
<p>[The three Wraith darts fly overhead and as Sheppard looks up, Ford runs off.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes of after Ford. Ronon walks over to where McKay is dangling.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hi. It's Dr. Rodney McKay.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay holds out his hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Could you, um&#8230;get me down, please?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon just looks at him.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Ford is running through the forest, pursued by Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford stops and turns to face Sheppard as the Wraith darts are running their beams across the area.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Keep your hands where I can see them.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford raises his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We want to help.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford lowers his right hand and goes for his sidearm. Sheppard shoots him in the thigh, but Ford continues to unholster his gun, which he points at Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're not getting off this planet.</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith beam is getting closer.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'll show you. You'll see!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford leaps into the path of the beam. Sheppard watches him disappear and the dart fly away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, McKay and Teyla are briefing Weir and Caldwell.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
After they scooped up Ford, the darts made a beeline for the gate. We tried to stop them, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You had him in your sights, and you let him get away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I shot him once. It didn't slow him down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(raising his finger)<br />
I shot him too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He ran into the beam.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you suggesting he wanted to be taken?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think he saw it was the only way off the planet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I can tell you from the quality time I spent with Ford, he was definitely not thinking straight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Now, thanks to you, he's in enemy hands with information that could compromise all of us.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell starts to walk away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't think he'll give us away.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell stops and turns around to face Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Oh, thank you so much for your assurance, Colonel. I'll be sure to include your feelings in my report.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell leave the room. The others exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS, RONON'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[There are two guards stationed by the door. Sheppard enters, gives them a nod and they step outside. Ronon is sitting on the bed.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
This place is impressive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Those Ancestors sure could build 'em.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
The guards are unnecessary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, with your habit of taking people hostage and all&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I meant, should I want to escape, they would not be able to stop me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Were you able to contact my home-world?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's why I'm here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, Sheppard and Weir are looking at a monitor, which shows a city which has been utterly destroyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We have machines called MALPs. They're capable of transmitting back images and information from other planets. We sent this one to the address you gave us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That is Sateda?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm sorry. It doesn't look like anyone survived the last attack.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon has a pained look on his face and after a glance at Sheppard and Weir, he walks out.]
