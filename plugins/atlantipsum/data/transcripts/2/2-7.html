<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team walks into a village. There are some lanterns on, but it seems deserted.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Another great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where is everyone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
There's smoke from the chimneys. They're inside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can't say I blame them. There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's check this out.</blockquote>
<p>[He leads them to a building.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[The team enters the crowded tavern. Everyone turns to stare at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Howdy, folks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
Who are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sheppard. This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
You from Ratira?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
From over the mountains, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A little further.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
Huh. Then you've come a long way. You'll be in need of food and drink. Sit.</blockquote>
<p>[They come in and sit at a table.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I take it you don't get many strangers around here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
No. Especially not those that travel near dark.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
You really don't know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Callum.<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
What's your business here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No business, really. We're just travelers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Then you best keep traveling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, then.</blockquote>
<p>[The team starts to stand up.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
Wait. Goran, you can't send them out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
They look like they can take care of themselves. It may not even start tonight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
It's been three months. How much longer do you think it'll wait?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hi. What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
The Daimos.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Never heard of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
It lives in the forest. It'll be feeding soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And it is, what, some kind of an animal, or&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
It's a creature. It has the appearance of a man, but it can suck the very life from your bones. Leaves only a dead withered husk behind.</blockquote>
<p>[As he speaks, the team realizes what he is talking about.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sounds familiar.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Goran now sits with the team; the barkeep serves them all drinks.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, we know you're not used to dealing with strangers, but we may be able to help you with this little problem you're having. We're used to dealing with this kind of thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We call them the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
These are the creatures from the old stories? From the time of the cullings?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So you have heard of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete. They tell of the great ships that descended from the sky, but there's no description of the Wraith themselves. Although there were a few among us who guessed that Daimos might be one of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Because it, too, came from the sky.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><i>[Goran describes what happened as scenes from the time are shown.]</i>
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
It was about ten years ago. A bright light appeared above the village&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Goran and others watch a light streak across the sky and into the ground over the horizon.]
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
&#8230;crashed into the hills. We didn't know what it was, but people were terrified.</blockquote>
<blockquote>YOUNGER GORAN<br />
Hurry, get in the house.</blockquote>
<blockquote>VILLAGER<br />
Come on!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The villagers hunt for the downed ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I went with some of the other men to investigate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAN<br />
Over here!</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
We found the wreckage, a few wounded survivors.</blockquote>
<p>[Wounded Wraith lie on the ground amidst the wreckage.]
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
We didn't know what they were. We decided to take no chances.</blockquote>
<p>[The villagers kill the Wraith with primitive wooden weapons and axes.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The villagers burn the Wraith bodies in a large bonfire.]
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
We slaughtered them, burned the bodies.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>END FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wise decision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Unfortunately we didn't get them all and although none of us saw it, evidently  one of them survived.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;VILLAGE, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The villagers come back. A woman screams at what she sees &#8212; a desiccated body.]
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(voiceover)<br />
It took its first victim that very night. We tried to hunt it down, but we couldn't find it.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>END FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
It's been out there ever since. It feeds three, four times a year. Takes two or three people each time. Two years after the crash, it took my own son.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That's it? One Wraith, in the forest?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon loads his weapon and starts to stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'll be done by morning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We'll all go together, in the daylight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
You're really going to help us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, like the man said, it's just one Wraith. It'd be downright unneighborly if we didn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
In that case, drinks are on me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sits back down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, well, let's not forget the food.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on an instrument as villagers walk by. He notices a boy watching him and becomes annoyed.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY<br />
(approaching)<br />
Is it true? You're going to hunt the Daimos?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It looks that way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY<br />
I heard it has two heads, and it can turn you to stone just by looking at you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you heard wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY<br />
My uncle says it'll come and take me if I don't do my chores.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He said that, huh? Well, then, if we get rid of it, you've got nothing to worry about, you'll never have to do chores ever again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOY<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Look, go away.</blockquote>
<p>[The boy walks away. McKay looks up to see Sheppard, Teyla and Ronon looking at him with chastisement.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Goran joins them.]
</p>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
As far as we know, no one was taken last night, but it will strike, and soon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(loading his gun)<br />
We'll kill it before that happens.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You must be great at parties.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[They search through the forest, Ronon leading the way.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We're talking about a hundred square miles of forest here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Be patient. Ronon's been going up against the Wraith one on one for the last seven years. If anyone can track this thing, it's him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And exactly how is he going to do that, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(from a distance)<br />
It helps to have good hearing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard slaps McKay on the back of the head as he walks past.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Carry on.</blockquote>
<p>[Later, Sheppard and Teyla walk together.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about you? You sensing anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I'm not sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
There is a presence here&#8230;but it is different. I cannot quite explain it.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon holds up his hand, then gestures for them to look ahead.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's in there.</blockquote>
<p>[The see a flash of the Wraith running behind a tree. Ronon runs toward it.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ronon! Damn it.</blockquote>
<p>[They all follow, chasing the Wraith through the forest. Ronon arrives outside a cave; the others arrive in a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's in there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Was it Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You see it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, how do you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon is correct. I can definitely sense it now.</blockquote>
<p>[They turn on their gun flashlights and go inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE</b>
</p><p>[They make their way into the cave. In their flashlights they glimpse a young, female Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
A female.</blockquote>
<p>[She runs, and the team chases her. She runs into a laboratory built into the cave, with crossed beams and plants in the ceiling. An older man is there.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LABORATORY IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Ellia?</blockquote>
<p>[He hugs her protectively. The team runs in and raises their guns at them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get out of the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No, please. Don't shoot. She's not what you think&#8230; She's my daughter.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and the others stare in shock and disgust.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
She means you no harm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She's a Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Maybe so, but she's different. I swear to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let me guess&#8212;Wraith with a heart of gold?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
She doesn't feed. She's never taken a human life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How is that possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard does so, and the others follow.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
It's all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Father&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No, I won't let them hurt you.<br />
(to the team)<br />
I raised her as my own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You live here, together?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
This was part of a mine before the last culling. It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice. The people of the village would not understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Gee, I wonder why.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The villagers told us there was a Wraith in the forest. It came here in a crashed ship ten years ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Ten years ago? Ellia was just a child. Do you really think that she could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So you know about that, then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
I was there. I helped kill the survivors.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[We see Zaddik's point of view as he finds young Ellia on the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
(voiceover)<br />
But when I found a young female lying unconscious some distance from the crash&#8230;I couldn't bring myself to hurt her. I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others. To this day, the people of the village don't know, and you must promise not to tell them. She's not responsible for what's been happening.</blockquote>
<p><i><b>END FLASHBACK</b></i>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LABORATORY IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Then who is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
I believe another Wraith survived the crash. An adult. That's who you should be looking for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If she does not feed, how does she live?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
At first I fed her as you would any child and that seemed to suffice. But then something began to change.</blockquote>
<p>[As he speaks, McKay looks around at the lab, which has various old-fashioned chemical components.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
The food no longer gave her any sustenance. There was a hunger growing in her that would not be satisfied. I heard the stories of the other creature, what it did to survive, and I was afraid that was what Ellia would become. And so I&#8230; started to experiment. I have extensive knowledge of the chemical properties of various medicinal plants that grow in this forest. Are you interested in science?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'm not sure that's what I would call this, but yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Ellia's hunger was growing stronger every day, and I wasn't sure that I could do anything for her. But eventually&#8230; I came up with this.</blockquote>
<p>[He holds up a flask.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard briefs Weir and Beckett.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
A drug that allows the Wraith to survive without feeding?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what he said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Is such a thing even possible?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We don't know enough about Wraith physiology to say for certain, although, I must admit, it's intriguing that this Dr. Zaddik claims the Wraith survived on normal food for a time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, if he's telling the truth, it might be the answer to a very puzzling question. Right now, our best guess is that the Wraith evolved from the iratus bug.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Like the one that attached itself to my neck a year ago?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I hate those bugs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Trust me, I know. We've speculated that they evolved into the Wraith when they began to take on the characteristics of the humans they were feeding on. Now, there are many aspects of human physiology that are quite useful&#8212;bipedal motion, opposable thumbs, large brain capacity. But the human digestive system serves no purpose in the adult Wraith. So, why have one at all?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Because they eat normal food when they're young.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Exactly then at some point, they lose the ability to sustain themselves with that food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So it's a teenage thing&#8212;pimples, rebellion, life-sucking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Something like that. The question is, what causes it? If it's due to some chemical deficiency, like a diabetic's inability to process sugar, then it's possible it may be addressed with some kind of drug.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So Zaddik could be telling the truth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'd like to go to the planet and check into it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Is that really necessary? I'm sure we could get a sample, bring it back here for you to analyze.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's not just the drug I'm interested in. This young Wraith could be very important for our research.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What research?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We're working on a retrovirus that would alter Wraith DNA, essentially stripping out the iratus bug elements of their genetic code and leaving only the human aspects behind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A drug that turns Wraith into humans?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Effectively, yes. But so far, we haven't had much success, partly because we lack the living tissue and blood samples we need to test it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
You think this girl would be willing to provide them?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard starts to shrug.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look, I realize we can't bring her back to Atlantis but I could take the retrovirus and the equipment necessary for the analysis with me to the planet. A few days with a cooperative test subject could be worth months of theoretical research. Elizabeth, I don't have to tell you how important this could be for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Sheppard)<br />
Is she dangerous?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's a Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Although&#8230; I have to admit she does seem a little different.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LABORATORY IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Ellia is grinding leaves with a mortar and pestel.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Like this?</blockquote>
<p>[He starts to walk around. The liquid in the flask is boiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
A little more. Now&#8230;why is distillation an important step?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
To remove the toxins from the Ferassin root?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Precisely. We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock, now, would we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
(smiling and rolling her eyes)<br />
No, Father.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously, have you seen anything like this before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No, I have not. She is unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What if it's all an act?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
If she were a killer, why would he protect her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They live here together, Rodney. If she were like other Wraith, he would be her first victim.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Teyla, this is Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Beckett, and Ronon are walking.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
We just got back with Beckett. Ronon's going to take him up to the cave. I'm going to check in with the villagers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(over radio)<br />
What are you going to tell them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'm still working on that.</blockquote>
<p>[They stop. Sheppard hands the equipment box he's been carrying to Ronon, then heads away to the village.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LABORATORY IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Beckett starts to unload his equipment, starting with a laptop.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
This equipment's remarkable. Where did you get it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, here and there. Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Oh, yes. Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia arrives, and Beckett sees her for the first time.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Would you like some tea?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Oh, thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[She hands a cup to McKay, who reluctantly takes it.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, no thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
(to Ronon)<br />
Would you like some?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Are you sure? It's very good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I said no.</blockquote>
<p>[She puts the tray down and brings back a plate of biscuits.]
</p>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Maybe some biscuits? I baked them myself.</blockquote>
<p>[He slams the plate out of her hand, furious.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Stay away from me!</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia screams at him in a Wraith voice. Ronon draws his weapon and aims it at her.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(holding up a hand to stop him)<br />
Ronon!</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia rushes out of the lab. Zaddik follows.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Ellia is sitting on the ground, crying. Zaddik sits beside her.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
It's all right. It's okay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
They hate me, don't they, Father?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No. No, no, no. They just don't know you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LABORATORY IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Was that really necessary?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but that's not going to change who she is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Teyla, this is Sheppard. Come in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Go ahead, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Is Ellia still in the cave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(into radio)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />

Yes. Why?</blockquote>

</p><p>[Villagers are gathered around a desiccated body.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
They just found another victim. Apparently he's only been missing for a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it. It looks like Zaddik might have been telling the truth after all.</blockquote>
<p>[The dead body is wheeled by on a hay cart.]

Colonel Sheppard. Is there any progress with this hunt?</blockquote>

We're working on it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Maybe we could help you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That won't be necessary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
We're sick of doing nothing. We're sick of being afraid all the time. That thing is hunting in daylight now. We'll never be safe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
You see? I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings. The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you confirm that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Not yet. It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Well, in the meantime, there's another Wraith out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
How?</blockquote>

May I speak with her?</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ellia, we need your help. You can sense the other Wraith.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia looks away.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is all right. It is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, I have the same ability.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Really?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us. And I knew even then that you were different. Your father has raised you well. He has taught you right from wrong. You are not like the other one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
I don't let him in. I don't like what he shows me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I know but you have to try. Now, we need to find him.</blockquote>

You don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I have tried myself, but I can get nothing. Please.</blockquote>

All right.</blockquote>

Good. Now, concentrate.</blockquote>

Yes, just to the east.</blockquote>

All right, let's go. McKay, stay here and help Beckett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, medical research is not really my thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And hunting Wraith?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
But, I mean, I can stay&#8230;and help Beckett.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and the others leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Never could get into biology. There's just too much information about the human body. One time, I took it as an undergrad, I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions before I had to drop the class.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Really.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, believe it or not, back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You know, this does require a certain amount of concentration.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(teasing)<br />
What, am I bothering you?&#8230; Maybe I'll go get some air.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon arrive.]
</p>

This must be the river she saw in her vision.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
(to Beckett)<br />
Let me ask you something. If you can prove to everyone that I'm telling the truth, that Ellia no longer needs to feed, do you think the villagers would accept her?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett doesn't look hopeful.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
That's what I'm afraid of.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia is eavesdropping on the conversation.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No matter how hard we try to convince them, they'll always see her as a monster. I'm getting old, doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, you've got lots of time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Never have as much as we think you have. And when I'm gone, she'll be alone. I&#8230;tried to teach her about love and human companionship. But that's exactly what she'll never have.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia looks down in sadness at what she hears.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Zaddik, there's something I want to show you. I didn't say anything at first, because I didn't want to get your hopes up.</blockquote>
<p>[He opens a case and takes out a metal vial.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's a retrovirus&#8230;something I've been working on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
I don't understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, God. How am I going to explain this? Part of Ellia is human, and part of her comes from a creature we call the iratus bug. It's the part that makes her look the way she does and where her desire to feed comes from. Now, it's possible, by means of this retrovirus, we can strip away those parts, and leave only the human parts behind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
(smiling hopefully)<br />
You mean she'd be like you and me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes. Now, I must warn you, the retrovirus is still experimental. In fact, it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so far, without much success. I'm hoping that what we can learn from your daughter will help me perfect it.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay rushes in.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We've got a problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Why didn't you just radio me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I could've, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay, Beckett, and Zaddik rush out. After they are gone, Ellia comes in and opens Beckett's case, the one with the retrovirus.]

Not at the moment, no.</blockquote>

It's not, not by a long shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Why would she do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(into radio)<br />
She must've overheard us talking about it. I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Please, you've got to find her before the villagers do.</blockquote>

(into radio)<br />
Look, Ronon says we're close. If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the Wraith.</blockquote>

Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go&#8212;any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?</blockquote>

Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills. I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me.</blockquote>

Oh&#8230;where did you go?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
I was hiding. I didn't want the others to know&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
To know what? Ellia, why did you take the retrovirus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Because I don't want to be this way anymore. I hate what I am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
If you heard what Dr. Beckett said, you know the retrovirus isn't ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
I had no choice. When they kill the other Wraith, I won't be able to pretend anymore.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Pretend what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
I've wanted to tell you for a long time&#8230; Your serum doesn't work, Father. It never has.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
(smiling reassuringly)<br />
That's impossible. It's been two years since you&#8230; Since the last time. That wasn't your fault. It was my idea. I needed time to perfect the formula.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
But it wasn't working. The hunger just&#8230;got worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
(realizing)<br />
What did you do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
I'm sorry, Father.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No. No, that was the other one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
It was both of us. I sensed him out there. I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No. No, it can't be.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia grunts and bends over in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Ellia?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELLIA<br />
Stay away!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
What is it? What's happening?</blockquote>
<p>[She grimaces in pain. Her hand starts to change color to dark purple, like an iratus bug. The color change moves up to her face. She screeches.]
</p>

Let me help you.</blockquote>

No.</blockquote>

Huh. Me neither.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Nearby, Sheppard and the others hear the shots and go running in that direction.]
</p><p>[At McKay's location, the Wraith starts to lean over McKay, but Ellia arrives and tackles the Wraith. They fight for a moment, and Ellia breaks the Wraith's neck. Ellia's skin is much darker and her left hand is claw-like. She advances on McKay with a threatening expression.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Easy, now. You went through the trouble to save my life. It'd be a shame to kill me.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett shoots Ellia, wounding her in the shoulder. She screeches at him then runs away.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You all right, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(shakily, grasping at his chest)<br />
Yeah, just peachy. What the hell was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I guess so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh, God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
On the&#8230;yeah, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett pats him reassuringly. He mumbles and puts his hand up under his tee-shirt to feel for a feeding wound.]

</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Ellia? You poor girl. You never deserved this.</blockquote>
<p>[She growls and approaches him.]

I know part of you is still there.</blockquote>
<p>[She snarls and grabs him by the neck.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Aah! Ellia, please. This isn't you.</blockquote>
<p>[She throws him hard into the hillside. She stands and screeches loudly. Both Atlantis groups hear her and run toward the sound.]

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<p>[He grunts in pain.]

<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Don't you remember me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
No&#8230;it can't be&#8230; You were taken by the daimos.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
No, Father.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Father? I don't understand. You're&#8230;you're his son?</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
Precisely.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard's group has arrived.]
</p>
<blockquote>BARKEEP<br />
There's another one of those things out there. Look what it did to Zaddik. I say we go after it, now!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No one's going anywhere. We'll handle this. Stay calm. How is he?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett stops over to talk to them.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe. He's not going to make it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
This can't be happening. It's not possible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
I'm sorry. Don't blame Ellia. It was my idea. You&#8230;have to have to understand&#8230;that when I found her, I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.</blockquote>

</p><p>[Zaddik finds Ellia after the crash.]
</p>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
(voiceover)<br />
She was just lying there, helpless. When I saw her, I knew what I had to do. As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl.</blockquote>

<blockquote>YOUNGER ZADDIK<br />

(after a hesitation)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Teyla, Ronon, you're with me. The rest of you, stay here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel, the retrovirus is acting quickly. The human part of her is almost gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You said she killed the other Wraith and saved McKay's life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing. She's operating on a purely animal level right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Is there nothing you can do for her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring her back alive, but I doubt she'll cooperate. She's also stronger and faster than any Wraith I've ever seen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(in a high-pitched, sarcastic voice)<br />
Great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
(to Zaddik, upset)<br />
All this time&#8230; We thought you were dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
There was no other way. They never would have accepted us&#8230;And I couldn't abandon her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GORAN<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZADDIK<br />
She&#8230;needed me.</blockquote>
<p>[Goran appears very upset.]

Ellia? We want to help you. Dr. Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us. We will not hurt you.</blockquote>
<p>[Ellia tackles Teyla to the ground. They struggle, an Teyla throws her off. Sheppard and Ronon hear it and come running.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />

<p>[Ronon shoots Ellia, but she runs away. Ronon and Sheppard stop to check Teyla. She is unconscious and has blood on the back of her head.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She took a blow to the head when it hit her.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Stay with her.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard takes his jacket off for Ronon to use to pillow Teyla's head.]
</p>

</p><p>[Teyla wakes up.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Teyla?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What happened? Where's Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
He went after the creature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You let him go alone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, he wanted me to stay with you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(exasperated)<br />
I am fine. Go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Who decides when it's one of those times?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />

<p>[He jumps up and runs off.]
</p><p>[At Sheppard's position, he turns to see Ellia approaching him along a large downed tree.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ellia? Don't make me do this.</blockquote>
<p>[She screeches at him. He shoots her with the machine gun as she attacks him, but she lands on him and tries to attack. He pulls his knife, but she holds that arm away from her. While she does that, her left-hand claw cuts his right arm. Blood flows from the wound. Ronon arrives and shoots Ellia. Sheppard rolls away. Ronon shoots her again. Then Ronon and Sheppard both fire on her, killing her.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. She tried feeding on me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
She wasn't going to let us take her back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. I know.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon starts to walk back the way he came. Sheppard looks at his arm, which is bloody from three puncture marks. He looks at Ellia again, then turns to follow Ronon.]
