<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[A Puddle Jumper flies through the active Stargate. The area around the 'gate looks abandoned, with pieces of rusted metal strewn around. The Jumper leaves the immediate area.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard flies, with Teyla in the jump seat and McKay and Ronon behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY <br />
Look familiar?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Me either. I do not believe I have been to this planet before.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no sign of any settlements, at least nothing recent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Other than the smoke from that campfire.</blockquote>
<p>[The forward view-screen shows smoke in the forest ahead. Teyla smiles at McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh. Yes, well, other than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'll land within a few hundred yards.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper comes in low over a pond.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team walks through the village, which is made of tents and thatched huts, with bits of scrap metal around. There is smoke but no sign of people.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's primitive, definitely primitive. Probably not even worth making contact. What is that smell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(calling out)<br />
Hello?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It appears they left in a hurry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Just not used to friendlies coming out of the gate.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sees a cook fire and goes to it. He reaches for a spoonful of food from the metal pot.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What are you&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon puts the spoon to his mouth.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, my God, he's tasting it! You don't know what that is. That could be their laundry!</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Pretty good!</blockquote>
<p>[He scoops up some more.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yes, good idea. And when you're finished with their porridge, why don't we try their beds, hmm?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon holds some dried meat up to McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Want some?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How good is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Leave it be, Goldilocks.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear the rush of arrows being fires.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Get down!</blockquote>
<p>[Arrows land in the dirt all around them. Ronon is hit in the calf.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Take cover!</blockquote>
<p>[They rush to get behind boulders and metal pieces. Some of the attackers are visible through the forest; they shout at each other. Others come up behind them and start firing with slingshots. Smoke appears where the slingshot projectiles hit. The team returns fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What the hell's in those slingshots?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon sits up to deal with the arrow through his calf.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm fine.</blockquote>
<p>[He breaks off the arrow's shaft on the fletching side, then pulls it out of his leg from the other side.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Ohh!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(shouting)<br />
You know This is not the way to make new friends! But we'll leave if you want us to!</blockquote>
<p>[The attackers are silent.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's take that as a yes. Let's go back to the jumper. Teyla, you're on point. I'll take the six. McKay, help Ronon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Don't worry about me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm a worrier. Let the man give you a hand.</blockquote>
<p>[They get up, McKay supporting Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Fire!</blockquote>
<p>[The slingshot group fires, pinning down the team. The team fires back. After a moment they hear the sound of aircraft flying in at low altitude. The craft comes to a hover above the. The jet-wash from the downward-facing nozzles blows on both the team and the attackers. The aircraft moves and aims its nozzles such that its jet-wash throws a group of the attackers backward to the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, move! Move!</blockquote>
<p>[They move out, Torrell watching with an angry expression.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The team rushes up the ramp. Sheppard runs to the pilot station as everyone gets secure.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Everyone in one piece?</blockquote>
<p>[The Jumper lifts off.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yeah, thanks to that ship.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon starts to stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Be still.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to examine his leg.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I like their timing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No kidding. Did you see that thing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I saw that thing.</blockquote>
<p>[The ship maneuvers in front of the Jumper's front screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>PILOT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Unidentified ship. This is the security vessel <i>Poros</i>. Follow us immediately, and we will lead you to the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood, <i>Poros</i>. And thanks for the help back there.<br />
(to team)<br />
That's how you make new friends.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard pilots the Jumper to follow the aircraft.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;OLESIAN CITY ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The city is modern, similar to modern cities on Earth.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;COURTYARD ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The team is guided to meet a female official.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIN<br />
Welcome to Olesia. I am Marin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard. Teyla Emmagan, Dr. Rodney McKay, Ronon Dex.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIN<br />
Please follow me.</blockquote>
<p>[The start walking with her.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARIN<br />
I sent a security detachment as soon as we detected your presence on the island. The prisoners there can be quite hostile.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Prisoners?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIN<br />
Yes, the island's a penal colony. The prisoners usually don't cause much trouble,
(smiling)<br />
as long as you don't try to land there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, you could put up a sign.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Stargate is on the island. Does this not affect your ability to trade with other worlds?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MARIN<br />
Yes, of course. As a result, we have needed to be almost entirely self sufficient.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then why put a prison there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I believe the Magistrate is better suited to answer these questions. He's very eager to meet you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
Your ship is a most intriguing design. I must admit, I'm surprised to find others in this galaxy whose technology rivals our own. Aside from the Wraith, I mean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's funny&#8212;I was about to make the exact same comment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
Where do you come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Until recently, Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
The ancestral city?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the Wraith a short time ago.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
How tragic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we're pretty broken up about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
We are part of a small group of people that were able to escape.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
How fortunate for you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, yes. Very fortunate. Look, getting back to the technology thing. I'm just curious. How have you been able to make such advancements without the Wraith stepping in?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
The Wraith have chosen to leave us alone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They've never come here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
The Wraith have been here many times, but with the ancestral ring on the island, the Wraith have always been, uh&#8230;how shall I put this? Satiated with the prisoners living there. The Wraith have no need to venture any further.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard exchange glances.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that would explain why you put the prison there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
The island has been a penal colony for hundreds of years. Its location there has benefited my people greatly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not all your people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
I assure you, only the most violent criminals are sent there&#8230;as you discovered.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's a good crime deterrent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
Crime is virtually non-existent on Olesia. Unlike the prisoners, we pride ourselves on being a most hospitable and civilized people.</blockquote>
<p>[The team looks skeptical.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;OLESIAN BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[The Magistrate takes the team on a tour of a glass-walled building.]
</p>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
This section of the city is devoted to scientific research. Our scientists have recently attained success in the enrichment of a fissionable, yet non-radioactive, material to be used in generating power for the city.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Fissionable yet non-radioactive? Well, that-that-that's&#8230;is that even possible? What kind of material is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
It's an ore extracted from a mineral found on our planet. It's quite volatile, yet yields great promise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
I'd be very happy to show you the laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I'd be very happy to see it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'd be very happy to go back to our ship. Our people are due to check in with us in a little while over radio. I'll have to get back within range.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
You can link with one of our radio relay stations. There should be enough power to reach the island, if that's your concern.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So we'll be speaking privately?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
And you believe they might be willing to share some of this mineral?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, they seem open to it. They don't get many trading opportunities coming through the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sounds promising.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;RECEPTION HALL IN OLESIAN BUILDING</b>
</p><p>[Food is laid out on tables. Ronon and McKay check in out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
There is, however, the minor moral hiccup of their form of capital punishment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
They have an island. It's their own version of Alcatraz, where they send their worst criminals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
And the gate is on the island, so&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
So the Wraith feed on the prisoners?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;RECEPTION HALL ON PLANET</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
I prefer lethal injection, although I do have a certain fondness for the electric chair. Call me a romantic.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard chuckles.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(into radio, biting into a piece of food)<br />
The Wraith get what they want, and the Olesians get left alone. I'm surprised it works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
He did, however, say that only the most violent criminals get sent there, and that it has been this way for hundreds of years.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(on comm, to Sheppard)<br />
Do you kill all of your violent criminals on Earth?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(on comm)<br />
Certain countries, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(on comm)<br />
Do we need to get into this right now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Well, we do if we plan on doing business with these people.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I want to know more before I jump to any conclusions.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;OLESIAN CITY ON PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We were able to speak with our people, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If you're open to it, we'd like to discuss possible trade opportunities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
We are <i>very</i> open. I'm sure there is much that we can learn from each other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, Dr. Elizabeth Weir will be the one to begin official negotiations with you. That's really her thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MAGISTRATE<br />
I'm looking forward to meeting her, and to the start of a promising friendship.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET ABOVE WATER, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper skims the water.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously, am I the only one creeped out by that guy?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Politicians, Rodney&#8212;they're all creepy.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER ISLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Torrell sees the Jumper through a makeshift telescope.]
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Prepare to fire!</blockquote>
<p>[His men prepare to fire home-made cannons.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Margaret Thatcher wasn't creepy. Okay, well, maybe a little. She resembled an aunt of mine&#8212;same hair style, facial structure, only my aunt was much taller and remarkably hirsute. Oddest thing&#8212;she had to shave twice a day.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla roll their eyes.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER ISLAND, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Fire!</blockquote>
<p>[The prisoners light off the cannons, firing large metal balls at the Jumper.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
They're shooting at us.</blockquote>
<p>[Smoke appears in front of the Jumper.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The prisoners?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
With what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Cloak the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can't. We took some damage. We'll be lucky to make it to the 'gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, how close are we?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Close enough to dial.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla starts dialing.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER ISLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The prisoners light off more cannon fire. One ball explodes near the Jumper without hitting it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That was close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Get ready to send an I.D.C.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER ISLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper is hit by fire and immediately starts to descend.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I've lost control systems. Hang on.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER ISLAND, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper descends into the forrest. The prisoners see this and cheer.]
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Now find them!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper is heavily damaged, having come to rest after gouging a path through the earth.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[Teyla regains consciousness first.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Oh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I think I chipped a tooth. Did I chip a tooth? Am I bleeding? Because I'm a high risk for endocarditis.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard rouses.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
John?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was, uh&#8230;not one of my better landings. Sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
The gate should still be active for a few minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Let's go.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The walk down the smoky ramp. Torrell and the prisoners rush up on them, pointing their crude weapons. Sheppard gestures for Ronon to raise his hands.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hi, folks. I hope I didn't crash-land on anybody.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p>[The prisoners have pulled everything from the Jumper and are examining it. Torrell fires off a P-90 into a pond. Another prisoner aims a bazooka, but it fires the opposite direction he intends, taking out a tent behind him. After a moment, the men laugh.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRISONER SHACK</b>
</p><p>[All four team members are tied up with their arms around a pole behind their backs, and their necks tied to vertical supports. Torrell and some men enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You should know our people are expecting us. If we don't show up soon, they'll come looking for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Ah. Is that supposed to concern me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Don't go getting all full of yourself, chief. A few cannons are no match for the kind of firepower they'll be bringing with them. Although&#8230;I should compliment whoever took that first shot&#8212;it was a good one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Yeah, it was nice, wasn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What do you want from us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Well, we've already got your weapons.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Now I do believe we'll take your ship. You see, we had been planning a little trip to the mainland but after seeing you fly that thing through the ancestral ring&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You're referring to the ship you just shot down? The one that doesn't stand a hope in hell of ever flying again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
The ship that you're going to fix, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Who am I, MacGyver? Fix it with what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
(to one of his men)<br />
Get him up.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is made to stand. He appears very concerned.]
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
You seem like a smart man. I'm sure you'll think of something. Maybe all you need is a little motivation.</blockquote>
<p>[He fires Ronon's blaster past Rodney to blow a large whole in the side of the shack.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe you should think about fixing it, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Good idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
My friends all tell me I have a remarkable gift for persuasion.</blockquote>
<p>[A prisoner starts to untie McKay.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
The gate activated. Nothing came through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
So we assumed. We received no I.D.C., a few moments later, the gate shuts down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They should've returned by now. Dial the planet and try to establish a radio link.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Major Lorne, this is Weir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
I may have to go off-world to assist Colonel Sheppard. I'd like you to assemble a team and have a puddle jumper ready to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PRISONER VILLAGE, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PRISONER SHACK</b>
</p><p>[The three are trying to loosen their bindings.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Anyone having any luck?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
These bindings are very secure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, leave it to convicts to know the best way to tie people up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(angry)<br />
Well, eventually I will get free and when I do, he's going to pay for this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, listen to me. When you get free, you get us free, and we all get out of here. Let 'em find out we're gone <i>after</i> we're gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
You expect me to let them get away with this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The operative words are "get away."</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
After I kill him&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That type of thinking will get <i>us</i> killed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Well, if you would've returned fire&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The weapons systems were damaged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If you say so.</blockquote>

Yeah, well, you're going to murder us the minute we step through the gate anyways. What difference does it make?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
That's very distrustful.</blockquote>
<p>[They hear something coming.]
</p>
<blockquote>PRISONER<br />
Wait, look!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh no&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith cruiser is making its way slowly toward them, as if coming in for a landing.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The Jumper cruises over the water toward the island. Lorne brings up the HUD.]
</p>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We've got a Wraith cruiser headed for the island, and I'm picking up several more on approach outside the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<p>[The Jumper cloaks.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Go to stealth mode. Let's find our guys before they do.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
What is that? What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's a Wraith cruiser, and trust me, you don't want to be around when it gets here.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon takes his stunner from Torrell before he can react, then points it at the armed prisoners.]
</p>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Come on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wait, wait.<br />
(to McKay)<br />
Dial the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(from inside)<br />
Stop!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If all the prisoners get off this island, where do you think that ship will go?</blockquote>
<p>[The cruiser is getting closer.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No! We've got a big problem in here!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and others rush in.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's wrong?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I lost power to the DHD.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I told you the power feed would be intermittent at best. We should've dialed when I patched it instead of standing around talking&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Can you fix it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
They're right on top of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
We could shoot them down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Neither your weapons nor ours will damage it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about the drones? Can you patch enough power to arm them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
They're not as intricate as the DHD. Maybe one, given the time constraints.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Can one drone shoot down an entire Wraith cruiser?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe we'll get a lucky shot. McKay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(working on console)<br />
Almost&#8230;just give me one more&#8230;and&#8230;okay! We're armed! Go, before the power cuts out again!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER CRASH SITE, DAY</b>

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>

Did you see that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
A drone.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We scored a hit. That's either going to buy us time or piss 'em off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
If they didn't know we were here, they sure as hell do now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, you damaged the Wraith cruiser&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Her voices comes over the radio Torrell is holding.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Dr. Weir&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
&#8230;And it's leaving the area. But there are two more cruisers incoming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
(handing over the radio)<br />
Here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Elizabeth, where are you?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
We're in Jumper 2. We're cloaked, directly above you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Our jumper's disabled. Right now, I need you to dial the gate to one of the back-up planets to the Alpha site. Doesn't matter which one.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
Understood.<br />
(to Lorne)<br />
Do it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Time to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TORRELL<br />
Why should we trust you? Huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If you want to stay, stay. I really don't give a damn, but you are not coming home with us!</blockquote>
<blockquote>ELDON<br />
(standing in objection)<br />
But I&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can come.</blockquote>
<p>[Eldon sits back down. Torrell gives a half-hearted salute and leaves. Ronon gives him a predatory smile.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Elizabeth I need you to keep the gate open until the last of them go through, then shut it down. Dial Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(over radio)<br />
We can land and pick you up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Negative, just keep the gate open. We'll take it from there. Stay in stealth mode till the Wraith have gone away.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LORNE'S PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
