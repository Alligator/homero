<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard's team makes their way through a thick forest.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is ridiculous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, keep complaining about it, and we may get there faster.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, couldn't we have met these people on a tropical beach planet, populated by tall, blonde women? Hmm?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Whoever wants to speak with us obviously values their privacy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, well, I value my time, and this is a waste of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's a waste of time is listening to you, Rodney. This is the mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, it strikes me that this is a mission better suited to one of the lower echelon teams.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
"Lower echelon"?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He means to say "less important."</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We got a tip from one of Teyla's contacts. We're following it up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And this is, like, what, the umpteenth tip we've followed up in search of a ZPM?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Rodney&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I just want to make it clear that every second I am out of my lab is a second the galaxy goes without another groundbreaking&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Men hiding in the forest come forward and shoot all four members of the team with stun weapons. Sheppard and the others fall to the ground, unconscious.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
We have to get them to the gate before their people realize they're missing.</blockquote>
<p>[The men take the weapons from Sheppard and the others.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and the others are seated around a large wooden dining table when hoods are removed from their heads. Men dressed in a variety of homespun clothing surround them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You guys okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(upset)<br />
Oh, yeah. Fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Seems like a whole lot of trouble to go through just to get us to dinner&#8230; Not a talkative bunch, are you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
If we release you from your bindings, do you promise not to attack us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, we promise.</blockquote>
<p>[Aiden Ford enters, chuckling. Ronon tries to get up and approach him, but other men hold him back.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Before we untie them, they have to know that they're among friends.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You thought I was dead, didn't you, Sheppard?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard exchanges looks with the rest of the team. Ford smiles mildly, the left side of his face still altered by the earlier Wraith injury.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[There is a plate of food in front of each of Sheppard's team. They are now untied.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Guys&#8230; Guys, please, eat. Eat.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford takes a bit from Teyla's plate. Ronon sniffs the food. Ronon and McKay start to eat.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(to his men)<br />
Well, men, this used to be my team.<br />
(indicating Ronon)<br />
Well, not this one&#8230; but I think he's okay, too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What is all this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Just some local vegetables, a sort of alligator thing. It tastes like salted meat. It's good. Try.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not talking about the food. What the hell is going on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Who are these men? And why bring us here like this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Whoa. That's a lot of questions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Pick one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
"Pick one." That's good. Where'd you find him, Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(speaking with his mouth full)<br />
Maybe you should start with how you managed to escape being culled by the Wraith Dart?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard gives him a look.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Hmm? What? When I get nervous, I get hungry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Okay. The Dart&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>BEGIN FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;P3M-736 FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[From "2.03 Runner", Sheppard has hit gun aimed at Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford! You're not getting off this planet.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford jumps into the Wraith culling beam from the Dart that passes by.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Ford wakes up on the Wraith ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I have no idea how long I was in the Dart. Next thing I knew, I was on a cruiser, and I was awake.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(still eating)<br />
It's the enzyme. It makes you almost immune to the Wraith stunner, so when you dematerialize from the Wraith Dart, you're awake, as opposed to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
As opposed to dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>BEGIN FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Awake, Ford grabs a knife and stabs the Wraith soldier standing over him. He grabs its weapon and fires on the Wraith. Then he kneels beside it with his knife.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I cut open his enzyme pouch, took my fill, and made my way off the ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>BEGIN FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Ford makes his way through the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(voiceover)<br />
You can get around pretty easy on a Wraith ship. They're not used to people making it aboard, so there's next to no security.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford shoots another Wraith soldier and bends to cut into its arm for the enzyme pouch.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I walked off with enough enzyme to last me a little while, tracked down the Stargate, dialed the first friendly address I could remember.</blockquote>
<p><b>BEGIN FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p><p>[Ford enters the tavern and sees Kanayo.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I need a place to stay, a hot meal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
And what do you got to trade?</blockquote>
<p>[Ford takes out a Wraith stunner and puts it on the bar.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What'll that get me?</blockquote>
<p>[A bouncer grabs him from behind.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
No weapons.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford slams the bouncer's head into the bar and lets him fall to the floor. He turns back to Kanayo.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
So? What'll that get me?</blockquote>
<p>[Later, Ford is eating while Kanayo looks on.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
I still don't really understand.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Look at me. I got shot; I healed. I can see farther, clearer than I ever saw before.<br />
(voiceover)<br />
I told them about the enzyme, how it makes you stronger, more aware, more resilient, how it would give us a fighting chance against the
Wraith&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I mean, look at me. Look at me! I walked off a Wraith cruiser. It works.</blockquote>
<p><b>BEGIN FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;TAVERN</b>
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
I want to try it.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford shakes hands with Kanayo.]
</p><p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Wait a second. All your people here&#8230;all your men&#8230;they're on the enzyme?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p><b>BEGIN FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Kanayo and other of Ford's men stalk a Wraith patrol of two. They ambush and fire on them. One of the men starts to cut the enzyme from a Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
No. We don't do it like that anymore. Let's gate them back home.</blockquote>
<p>[The men drag the Wraith across the planet.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(voiceover)<br />
As our numbers kept growing, we needed more and more of the enzyme.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE</b>
</p><p>[Ford's men spar as Kanayo and others drag the Wraith in to put them beside other Wraith. All the Wraith are shackled and unmoving. Ford enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Nice work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That should give us a steady stream of the enzyme. Time to focus on some bigger issues.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Aiden do you mean to tell us that there are live Wraith here in this cave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Wraith can communicate with each other over a distance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
But not between stars. They'd have to be in this solar system.<br />
(indicting McKay)<br />
You taught me that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(still eating)<br />
Yes, well, good for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(chuckling)<br />
What's the matter? They can't communicate if they're unconscious.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why'd you jump us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah&#8230; Yeah, I'm sorry about that. It was the only way to get you here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why didn't you just tell us where you were? You know we would have come.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Yeah, you and a special ops team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(unconvincingly)<br />
No, no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I know you think I'm crazy. I brought you all here to show you that you're wrong. I mean, do I look crazy? Do I seem&#8230;out of control?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Are we speaking in relative terms, or, um&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Look&#8230; Jace here has really fine-tuned the enzyme. We know how to administer it now, how to regulate it, refine it&#8230; We've gotten so good, we can even lace food with it.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla, Ronon, and McKay all stop eating.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Congratulations. You've just had your first dose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay spits ou the food in his mouth. Ronon pulls some out.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I thought long and hard about how to show you that the enzyme was safe&#8230; Convince you that it was the first step to defeating the Wraith, so you'd convince Weir, convince the military.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(standing, furious)<br />
Are you out of your mind?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Hey, settle down, McKay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(screaming)<br />
No, I will not settle down! I have been drugged against my will, you little punk!</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You should not have done this, Aiden.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Hey, be as mad as you want. Couple of days, you'll be thanking me. We'll all have a good laugh about this. Now, eat up.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford walks out. Ronon gets up, but a man holds a stunner to his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(panicking)<br />
I'm itchy. I'm itchy all over. This is exactly what happened when I toked pot once in college.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stands up.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Everyone stay put.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks toward where Ford has gone, in an adjacent room. Men stop him.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Let him go.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford&#8230; look&#8230; I know what you're trying to do. I get it, I do, but you're going about this all wrong. Weir isn't going to listen to us if we're all hopped up on the enzyme.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Your food was clean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why? Why me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You're going to be the witness. You're going to be the one to tell Weir that her most trusted team has taken the enzyme and is better because of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, buddy&#8230;why don't you come back with us? Have Beckett look you over. That's the best proof.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No. No, I've thought this through. This is the plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, I don't know what you're thinking&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You're free to roam around as much as you want. You're all a part of the team now.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;DHD ON PLANET</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on the DHD. Sheppard, Teyla, and Ronon are with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay so why aren't these guys watching us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Ronon is right. They went to great trouble to get us here. Why would they allow us to leave?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, that little bastard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There it goes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
This is what I was afraid of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What did he do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's taken all the necessary control crystals, something I showed him how to do on a mission, I might add.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, that's not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That is the understatement of the year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. See what you can do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Okay, why don't we just take them? All we've got to do is get our hands on one stunner and I can take them all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, maybe, but if we mess it up, whatever trust we might have been given will disappear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You want to make them trust us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We play it cool. We let them get comfortable. They're bound to make a mistake.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(skeptical)<br />
And in the meantime?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We play along&#8230; How are you guys feeling?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I didn't eat that much. I feel fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Perhaps if we were able to fast they will be unable to administer the enzyme. I doubt that. I don't think they'd have a problem forcing us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, well, this thing is useless, and I ate my face off, and I can tell you, I can feel it working. There's a good possibility that everything you're feeling right now might be psychosomatic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, is that right, Professor Science? Is that your expert opinion?</blockquote>
<p>[They start to walk away from the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yes, it is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, I can tell you, when they up the dosage, the side effects will be very real and very unpredictable.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're back early.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Ah, Jenev's kind of a closed society. Very polite and very courteous, but completely uninterested in having anything to do with us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, better that than hostile, I suppose. Colonel Sheppard's team is three hours overdue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
It wouldn't be the first time. Any radio contact?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
None since they left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(smiling)<br />
Well, you know those guys.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What do I know about those guys?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(unconcerned)<br />
Just that they tend to get all caught up in whatever it is they're doing, and sometimes they don't check in. They forget how much you worry. That <i>we</i> worry. Collectively, I mean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(subtly pressuring)<br />
Yes, we do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
(relenting)<br />
Yeah&#8230;we do.<br />
(to his team)<br />
Okay, guys, looks like we're heading back out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
You're welcome.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay paces nervously.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Seriously, I'm getting, uh&#8230; I'm getting chills and hot flashes, chills and hot flashes, again and again. None of you are feeling that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(agitated, to Sheppard)<br />
The enzyme side effects are going to be the least of his concerns if he keeps this up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know. Just be patient.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Historically, that hasn't been a strength for me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(emphatically)<br />
I know.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Sheppard, Teyla. Kanayo's running a mission off-world. I want you to go with him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We're running an op. I thought you might want to see the men in action.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sure. Wherever you need us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Just give us some weapons, and&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Nice try. No, you're going to hang back and watch with Kanayo. Don't worry. You won't be in any danger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's a load off of <i>my</i> mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What about us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Jace will give you the grand tour, show you what we've done with the place. How does that sound?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It sounds delightful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Okay, good. Then if Sheppard tries anything off-world, you'll be nice and close for me to kill you both.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can't think of a better way of spending the afternoon.</blockquote>
<p>[Kanayo points a gun at Teyla and gestures for the to leave.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Move.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Looks like he's itching to go.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon walks menacingly around Ford, grabs his coat, and knocks over a chair before leaving.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;WORMHOLE</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;PLANET, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[There is a village in the distance.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;FOREST, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Ford, Sheppard, and the others watch as a group of men run by on a trail.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are those guards Genii?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What exactly are we doing here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
The Genii have spies all over the galaxy. If for whatever reason one of them can't make it back to the Genii home-world, their leaders have established safe houses. If they need a place to reload on gear or a place to hide, they come here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Yeah. We've found it to be an excellent source of information and supplies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How did you find them in the first place?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
I was a Genii spy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If you're one of them, why don't you just walk in there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Well, I used to but eventually they realized I'd betrayed them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can see how they would.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
We rely on raids now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why? What more do you guys want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
We don't have all the pieces we need for the Lieutenant's plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right&#8230; and which plan would that be again?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
All will be revealed when the time is right. Oh, good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'd hate for things to be revealed too early.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LAB IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay gets a tour of Ford's lab from Jace. There are primitive computers and various flasks and tubes of chemicals.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
How are you powering these Genii computers?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JACE<br />
We stole a Telnorran generator. They're a pain to keep serviced, but they do the job. Actually, we just got our hands on some Pilation solar cells, but I haven't been able to figure out how to interface them yet. Have you used them before?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Can't say that I have. What&#8212;what do you do here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JACE<br />
We study the Wraith.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, yeah? How's that going?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JACE<br />
Some of our discoveries have been quite exciting, actually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>JACE<br />
Well, for one, they seem to be territorial, very much so, it turns out. They're not a united foe like we once believed.</blockquote>
<p>[He looks at an old computer terminal with Wraith writing.]

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Ford and the others hear the sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What is that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
It's an alarm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That shouldn't happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
No, it shouldn't.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford turns on his radio.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Sheppard, you there? Sheppard, you there?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is in a different part of the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
I think I might have set the alarm off. You guys be careful, because there's probably some guards on the way.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Too late. If you want to live, stay behind me.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon pulls out his blade with determination and moves forward.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CAVE ON PLANET</b>
</p><p>[McKay sees the bouncer inject himself in the arm with enzyme.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, do&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
Want some?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, I'm good, thanks.</blockquote>
<blockquote>GUARD #2<br />
You sure?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(nervous and frantic)<br />
Yeah, pretty sure. Look, don't you think that they should be back by now? I mean, how long does it take to fly there and fly back, you know? I mean, I say it's a minute from here to the gate, 10 tops from their gate to the hive ship, 20 to get in and lay a charge, and, what, like 10 more to get back out and home, right? So&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
Worrying really isn't going to do anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I subscribe to a different school of thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
They're fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You can't possibly know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
I got a gut feeling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, I have a different gut&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The guards approach him menacingly.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
&#8230;feeling.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard reloads his machine gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ford what's your position? Ford!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Ford and the others are engaged in direct combat with the Wraith. Some are firing while Ronon fights hand-to-hand.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard hears growling nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ah, damn it.</blockquote>
<p>[He pulls out a hand grenade and lobs it at a Wraith soldier. It blows up, blinding him. Sheppard moves in and fires on it.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Ford's team continue to fire. Kanayo and Teyla are hit with stun weapons and fall.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Keep fighting!</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is stunned from behind. He falls unconscious. A Wraith drags him away.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CORRIDOR ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[A Wraith drags Teyla away. Ronon continues fighting, back-to-back with Ford.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We can't hold them!</blockquote>
<p>[Ford is hit; Ronon keeps firing with both hands.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir speaks into a voice recorder.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And thanks to several modifications the specifics of which are encrypted in this data burst, we believe we can streamline our power consumption a further thirty percent&#8230; Also, at the time of this transmission, Colonel Sheppard's team is still missing, and is&#8230; is presumed&#8230; Colonel Sheppard's team is still missing. End transmission.</blockquote>
<p>[She drops the recorder on the desk, clearly upset.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;CELL ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is lying on a platform off the floor, his head on Teyla's leg. He wakes up. The rest of Ford's team is there too, awake and pacing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're in a holding cell?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
On a hive ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Uh-huh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sitting up)<br />
Well, then, no, I'm not doing so good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I can't believe you screwed up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(standing)<br />
I did what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You set off the alarm. You ruined the mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The Dart went on autopilot the second I got close to the hive. You're lucky I was able to get you out!</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, why would it do that? Why would it go on autopilot?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's what Jumpers do when they gate to Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, why didn't you say something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(incredulous)<br />
Why didn't I say something?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You want me to fail. You want me to look bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(angry)<br />
That's right, you snot-nosed brat. I'd put my team's life on the line just to prove you wrong.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon hears something.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We got company.</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith arrives with soldiers. Ronon stands at the netting holding them in, blocking the Wraith's view of the others.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
Move away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What do you want?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WRAITH<br />
(smiling)<br />
The one who flew the ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Why don't you start with me?</blockquote>
<p>[The netting slides open. A guard stuns Ronon, causing him to fall in pain.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(stepping forward)<br />
Wait, wait, wait. You want me.</blockquote>
<p>[The Wraith sniffs at Sheppard. He and the guards lead Sheppard away. Teyla helps Ronon up.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It's all right. There's always a way out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
If he dies&#8230;you die.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;QUEEN'S ROOM ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[The guards lead Sheppard to the a platform. He turns in a circle, looking around. A Wraith Queen appears right in front of him and hisses at him. She raises her hand toward his face and begins to exert mental control over him.]
</p>
<blockquote>WRAITH HIVE QUEEN<br />
Kneel.</blockquote>
<p>[Despite trying to resist, Sheppard falls to his knees.]
