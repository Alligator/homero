<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;QUEEN'S ROOM ON WRAITH SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Following on from 2.10 "The Lost Boys", Sheppard is on his knees, being interrogated by the Wraith Queen. She walks around him before speaking.]
</p>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
The ship&#8230;where did you get it?</blockquote>
<p>[She uses mind control to force him to answer.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(struggling not to speak)<br />

You mean the Dart? We call them Darts 'cause they're so pointy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
Tell me. Where?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I really don't want to say.</blockquote>
<p>[She hits him in the shoulder. Then she caresses his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't even know your name.</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUEEN<br />
In time&#8230;you will tell me every&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[The Queen stops talking and hisses. She leaves abruptly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"Every" what? What's wrong?</blockquote>
<p>[Two Wraith take him by the arms and start to escort him out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She didn't even tell me her name.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[Ronon, Teyla, Ford and his men are waiting when Sheppard arrives with his Wraith guards. They open the cell and push him in. He falls to the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel? Are you unharmed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(sitting up)<br />

Yeah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Where'd they take you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
A little Q &amp; A with the queen of the Hive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
What'd you tell her?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It was a short conversation. She walked out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. Maybe she was late for a meeting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
No. There's something else. I sensed she was agitated, even angry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why?</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[A Hive ship exits hyperspace just beside the first ship.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Another Hive ship has arrived.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The two Hive ships appear to be docked in space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you sure there's another ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I sense it. Close by.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe they're planning on culling the planet together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Or they're going to fight for it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Either way, the planet's only a few days away, so we don't have much time if we still intend to stop them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, first things first. How to get out. Any luck?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Not yet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Don't worry. I'll figure a way out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was afraid you were going to say that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN FORD'S CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay speaks quickly and nervously to Ford's men who stayed behind.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, they definitely should've been back by now. Seriously, am I the only one who thinks that maybe things haven't gone according to plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, look, we can't just sit here. We need we need&#8212; we need to do something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Like go get help. Look, we can dial the Stargate back to Atlantis where we have a ship, a fast ship with&#8212;with&#8212;with shields. We can fly to the Hive and rescue them if we need to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
Can't dial the gate, remember? Ford removed the control crystals from the dialing device.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, I know that. But here's the good news. You're the ones guarding them. Look, all you have to do is get me the crystals. I can fix the DHD and look, you just have to walk into Ford's little room back there and get them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
We're not giving you anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Then I can't dial the gate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
That's what I said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine? Look, just give me the damn crystals.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay tries to enter Ford's office, but the two minders stop him, one aiming a gun at him.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
You want the crystals, you're going to have to go through us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Unbelievable.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay pushes on the gun and walks away in disgust.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard studies the wall across from their cell.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Last time we were in one of these ships, McKay was able to open a door by cutting right into the wall.</blockquote>
<p>[Ford holds up a small knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You mean, like, with a knife?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You have a knife?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
One for them to find, one to keep. Everybody knows that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. I forgot all about that rule.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Well, it's a good thing I'm here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right. Now, just take your time&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[Ford throws the knife into the wall, but nothing happens.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I said take your time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I hit the exact spot you were pointing at!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right, all right. Anybody else have a knife?</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon pulls a knife from his wrist guard. Sheppard roles his eyes. Ronon throws the knife at the wall, and some of the lights go out.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Getting warmer.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon pulls out another knife.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How many of those things have you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
How many do you need?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN FORD'S CAVE</b>
</p><p>[The two minders play a board game while McKay sits nearby. McKay checks his watch and gets up.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;LAB IN FORD'S CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay enters with a determined look. He goes to a glass cabinet full of bottles.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(talking to himself)<br />

Okay. You can take them out, easy. Just a few well-placed karate chops, and&#8212;and&#8212;and&#8212;and&#8212;and then down they go. Piece of cake.<br />

(stepping away in doubt)<br />

That's&#8230;What are you, an idiot?<br />

(going back)<br />

Desperate times, desperate measures.</blockquote>
<p>[He opens the cabinet. He reaches for a small vial of the enzyme, but takes a entire bottle instead.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(holding up the bottle)<br />

That's one hell of a karate chop.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[There are now four knives stuck in the Wraith wall panel. Ronon pulls one more, from his hair.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You must have a hell of a time going through airports.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon throws the knife at the panel. The panel lights up for a moment, and the cell door opens. Sheppard sees Ford inject himself with enzyme.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford, what the hell are you doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
That's the last of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What about the rest of us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
You don't need it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
(angry)<br />

You don't know that.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stops Ford from leaving the cell first.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're heading to the Dart bay. Stay together, and stay quiet.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;LAB IN FORD'S CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay has injected himself with the entire bottle of enzyme. He grunts and breathes hard.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lock and load.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;DINING ROOM IN FORD'S CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay attacks the two minders without warning. He throws the bouncer across the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>BOUNCER<br />
Ah!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay breaks a bottle over the other one's head then punches him, knocking him down.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
And that's what happens when you back a brilliant scientist into a corner!</blockquote>
<p>[He turns and gets punched by the bouncer. McKay kicks him in the groin, knocking him to the ground.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Focus. Focus&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;FORD'S OFFICE IN CAVE</b>
</p><p>[McKay searches through drawers and finds the crystals.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Control crystals.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes them and leaves, breathing heavily.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The two Hives move through sub-space.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;HIVE CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[The team rushes along. Teyla stops them.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Wait. They are coming.</blockquote>
<p>[A Wraith soldier appears.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I got it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Ford!</blockquote>
<p>[The soldier shoots Ford, but it doesn't stop him. He struggles with the solidier until Ronon is ready to fire.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Move!</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon shoots the soldier.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
More coming!</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This way.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leads them away from at least four more Wraith.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;NEAR DHD ON FORD'S PLANET</b>
</p><p>[McKay works on the DHD.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(talking to himself in a high-pitched, nervous voice)<br />

Big dose. Big, big dose. But you needed it. You needed it to lay out the guards. Idiots. "You want the crystals? You're going to have to go through us." Well, I went through you, all right, didn't I? Like a hot knife through Jell-O. No, wait. Butter. Hot knife through butter. Oh, man, am I hungry. Okay, shut up, Rodney. Focus. Must finish dialing. Please, please work, please please please.</blockquote>
<p>[The gate engages.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, go home.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WEB AREA ON HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and the others find humans wrapped in Wraith webs. One calls for help.]
</p>
<blockquote>NEERA<br />
Help us&#8230;please&#8230;help us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
She's alive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
So is this one.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Let's get them out of here.</blockquote>
<p>[They start to free the humans.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
We don't have time to stop. This isn't the mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There is no mission, Ford. There's just your stupid plan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
If you hadn't screwed up&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look, the sooner you stop arguing with me and help me save these people, the quicker we get out of here.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The Stargate is active.]
</p>
<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
Unscheduled activation! Doctor McKay's IDC.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Lower the shield.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay comes rushing through the 'gate.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(holding up one arm)<br />

I know what I need to do!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney? What's happened? Hey, where are the rest of&#8212;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is sweating and speaks in a rambling fashion.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
There's no time, no time. The planet, not Ford's, the one the ship's headed towards we need to get there and don't have much time. I was barely able to escape myself, but I managed to take out the guards. Oh, you should've seen me. I was amazing. I wish we got it on camera, because&#8212;that's not the point&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, slow down. Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Yes. I mean, I don't know. I mean I had to take out the guards, and they were huge and dumb and stupid&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What guards?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ford's guards. Didn't I mention Ford?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, you didn't. You haven't mentioned Sheppard, Teyla, or Ronon either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes! They were there too, and there were the two guards. They were huge and massive, and I had to take them out, so I had to inject some of the enzyme.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You took some of the enzyme?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, no, no no, no. I didn't take some of the enzyme. I took a lot of the enzyme, because I had to, because I had to take out the guards, which I did. And you should've seen me. I was amazing!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you insane?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes. Yes. Now that I've taken the enzyme, yes!</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney, focus. Where is Colonel Sheppard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, no, I had to take the enzyme, because&#8230;because I had to take out the guards! But that's not the point. The point is we don't have enough time. We need to stop the ship from getting to where the ship is going.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Come on, come on, let's take a walk down to the infirmary. All right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Where are we going? What are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to go to the infirmary. I want to go to the, uh&#8230;the um&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[McKay collapses to the floor.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />

Dr. Beckett, we have an emergency. We're headed to you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WEB AREA ON HIVE SHIP</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and the others free the humans. Wraith soldiers rush in. Ronon fires on them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Move! Ahh!</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Teyla each try to life a human victim, but they are both shot by stunners. Ford and Kanayo fight on, but are eventually stunned as well. The soldiers take Neera and drag Ford away.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The Hives travel through hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[Teyla is seated on the floor and wakes slowly. Ronon is already awake.]
</p>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I think so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
You were shot by Wraith stunners. You both went down pretty quick. The effects of the enzyme must be wearing off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Where are the others?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard wakes up in a different cell. Ford is there, as is Neera.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Feeling better? Her name's Neera. Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(to Neera)<br />

Hi.<br />

(to Ford)<br />

Where are the others?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
They split us up into separate cells. I guess the Wraith figure keeping us in smaller groups will make it tougher to escape.<br />

(angrily)<br />

We shouldn't have stopped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's done is done, Lieutenant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
No. First, you set off the alarms, and then you stop to rescue people when you know damn well the Wraith are on our tail? It's like you're purposefully sabotaging this mission. You hate to see me succeed at anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You got a lot of issues to work out, Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Teyla and Ronon went down too quick when they were shot. The enzyme's wearing off.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Are you feeling anything yet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Not yet&#8230;but I will. It's happened before when I've run out of the enzyme.</blockquote>
<p>[They both stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
It gets pretty bad. So we've got to figure a way out of here. No more unnecessary stops.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard and Neera exchange looks.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Weir escorts Caldwell in.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Colonel Caldwell. I didn't think you were due back here for days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Dr. Weir requested that we join the search ASAP, so we pushed the engines a little.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How is he?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've sedated him, administered a beta-blocker to bring his blood pressure down to a more manageable level. It's a wonder he didn't suffer a stroke.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is lying on a bed, his hands restrained. He has an oxygen mask on. His eyes are closed, but he moves restlessly.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Did he mention anything further about the location of Colonel Sheppard and his team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Nothing coherent, I'm afraid. By the time he arrived here he was hyperventilating, pulse extremely rapid. He could barely get out a word. Although being Rodney, he certainly tried.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How much of the enzyme did he take?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
A very big dose, I'm afraid. I found a significant amount of it in his system; nearly as much as Lieutenant Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right. Can you wean him off it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I wish I could. Unfortunately, Lieutenant Ford took the last supply of our enzyme when he left Atlantis, so an incremental withdrawal is out of the question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Unless we harvest more enzyme.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Not an option. By the time we go out and collect it, the enzyme will have broken down in his system already. No, I'm afraid, for Rodney, the only choice is&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Cold turkey.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye, to put it bluntly. I can administer some drugs to help ease the process, anti-nausea medication, pain reliever, benzodiazepine for anxiety, as well as a multivitamin injection to bolster the immune system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But there's no dodging the fact it's going to be difficult, possibly even deadly.</blockquote>
<p>[They look at McKay, struggling in his sleep.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[Ronon and Teyla appear sweaty and ill.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
I'm just tired.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon lies down on a platform.]
</p>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
No. The enzyme's leaving your bodies. Mine too.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
How bad will it get?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KANAYO<br />
Bad. Maybe not for you. You guys haven't been on the enzyme for long&#8230; But me, on the other hand&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;WRAITH CELL</b>
</p><p>[In the other cell, Ford lies on the ground, shaking. Neera wipes his face with a cloth.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How are you holding up, Lieutenant?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I'm okay. I just need to get my hands on some more enzyme. Then I'll be able to get us out of here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We'll do it together, with or without the enzyme. We're a team, remember?</blockquote>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
I remember.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Awake, McKay struggles in the bed. The oxygen mask has been replaced by a cannula.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Don't just stand there. Get me more enzyme.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We don't have any.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's the cave. Ford's cave. He's got a whole cabinet of it. There's dozens of vials.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(leaning close)<br />

Do you know the address?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(weakly)<br />

No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm sorry, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You don't have to scream at me!</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not screaming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, this is fun for you, isn't it? Watching me like this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I assure you it's not.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(frantic)<br />

What is this? Payback? You're jealous, huh? You're jealous of how vital I am to this mission. Vital, vital. Jealous of how I get to go off-world, and you get stuck in this stupid pathetic excuse for a hospital.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You know that's not true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Jealous I get all the women and you don't!</blockquote>
<p>[The two nurses across the room look over.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Excuse me?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Please, just give me a little enzyme, just enough to take the edge off. I'm dying here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I told you we don't have any.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
You think I don't know you're lying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />

<blockquote>TECHNICIAN<br />
We have an I.D.C. It's Colonel Sheppard's code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Let 'em in!</blockquote>
<p>[Weir rushes down the stairs to the 'gate room.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS GATE ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard, Ronon, and Teyla walk through the active wormhole. Weir jogs over to meet them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sorry we're late.</blockquote>
<p>[Everyone smiles.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS PIER, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> lands on the pier.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett examines Ronon, while Teyla sits on the next bed. Sheppard stands between them, and Weir is nearby.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, up you go.</blockquote>
<p>[He helps Ronon sit up as McKay and Caldwell enter.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Why aren't you dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
It's good to see you, too, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, no, I mean, well you know what I mean. Why aren't you&#8230;dead?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, I knew when the Hives started to shoot at each other, it was just a matter of time before they blew each other up, so I went to the space gate and dialed an address where I could land safely. I didn't think the Dart could fit in our gate room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
The Colonel was kind enough to make us whole again, and we returned home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'm curious, Sheppard. How did you know the Wraith would fight each other?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Uh, a little intel from Ford and the gang, plus I kind of goosed things along with the queen.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay appears confused and a bit amazed.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It would appear the Wraith are becoming more territorial than we had thought. There is definite tension building among them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Which is good for us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It certainly is. It also opens a brand-new strategy in fighting them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Huh. And where is Ford?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He was aboard the Hive ship when it was destroyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
He was last <i>seen</i> aboard the Hive ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, you know Ford. I wouldn't be surprised if we run into him again.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard appears hopeful but unconvinced.]
