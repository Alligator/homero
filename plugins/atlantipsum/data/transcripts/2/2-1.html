</p><p><i>[Scenes from SGA 1.19 "The Siege Part 1" and SGA 1.20 "The Siege Part 2" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Ford and his team are on a balcony, flanked by two groups of Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>FORD<br />
Defense!</blockquote>
<p>[Firefight between Ford's team and Wraith. Most on both sides are killed or rendered unconscious. A Wraith soldier drone disarms Ford, takes him by the throat and starts to feed on him. Meanwhile, an injured Marine removes the pin from a grenade and drops it on the floor behind the Wraith feeding on Ford, where it explodes. Ford and the Wraith are blown off the balcony and fall into the ocean below.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;PUDDLE JUMPER</b>
</p><p>[The Puddle Jumper, piloted by Colonel Sheppard, approaches the dart bay entrance to a Wraith hive ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Major Sheppard, de-cloak your jumper immediately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(confused)<br />
What? Who the hell is this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Authentication Alpha-Charlie-One. De-cloak now.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;HIVE SHIP IN SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Puddle Jumper de-cloaks as it enters hive ship dart bay entrance.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir and Beckett are watching monitors anxiously as McKay reports.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Detonation in five, four, three, two&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Monitor shows positions of Wraith ships above the planet as red dots, with a blue dot representing the Puddle Jumper approaching a hive.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Dozens of Wraith darts fly over the city, firing on it. There is a bright flash through the clouds.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Monitor shows the bright flash of an explosion where one of the Wraith ships was positioned, then it disappears along with the blue dot representing the Puddle Jumper. McKay, Beckett and Weir are anxiously watching the screen.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Target has been neutralized.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He did it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(sadly)<br />
Yeah. He did it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Dr. Weir, I'm picking up another ship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Another hive ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Negative. I'm reading I.F.F.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(with disbelief)<br />
John?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
What other Sheppards do you know?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(smiling broadly and punching McKay on the shoulder)<br />
Oh, thank God.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(incredulous)<br />
No, it can't be. We saw the hive ship go up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
I assure you, Dr. McKay, that Major Sheppard is alive and well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Who is this?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell takes his seat on the bridge, flanked by his Bridge Officer, Kleinman and pilot, Cooper.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Colonel Steven Caldwell, commander of the <i>Daedalus</i>. We are ready to assist you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(with relief)<br />
Oh, thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we are very glad to hear it, Colonel. And I assume we have you to thank for saving Major Sheppard.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We were monitoring your transmissions as soon as we came out of hyperspace, but we couldn't beam him in until he de-cloaked his jumper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Didn't take much convincing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Dr. McKay?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(jumping to his feet with surprise)<br />
Present. Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
I trust you'll know what to do with this.</blockquote>
<p>[Two Marines carrying a metal box are beamed into the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARINE #1<br />
Your ZPM, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(shocked)<br />
How did they do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(excitedly taking the box from the Marine)<br />
The <i>Daedalus</i> is loaded with Asgard technology. The beaming technology's the first part of it. They've got&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
Rodney&#8230;</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What say we get the shields back up?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(smiling as he takes the ZPM from the box)<br />
What say we.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We still have Wraith all over the city.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
After we deal with this other hive ship, we'll assist you as soon as we can. Caldwell out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Sir, we have incoming enemy fighters bearing three-two-zero.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All forward rail guns stand by. Launch all fighters.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> IN SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Firefight between <i>Daedalus</i> and Wraith ships begins.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Dozens of Wraith darts are flying over the city.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS BALCONY, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Colonel Everett is struggling with a Wraith, he fires at it but runs out of bullets. The Wraith begins to feed on Everett, then an injured Marine fires at it.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> IN SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Firefight between <i>Daedalus</i> and Wraith ships continues.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Caldwell? This is Novak in Engineering.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
What is it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
Hermiod wanted to remind you that our shield strength will be severely diminished without the Zero Point Module tied into our power systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
I'm well aware of that, Doctor. Caldwell out.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is standing at the window of the bridge, where Caldwell joins him. The battle can be seen going on outside the ship.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Major, do you recommend any specific target on the hive ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
One of the fighter bays, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
It would increase the chance of secondary explosions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was the thinking, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I agree.<br />
(to Kleinman)<br />
Weapons, arm two Mark VIII tacticals. Our target is the hive ship's main fighter bay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Warheads armed. Target is locked, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Fire.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i>, SPACE BATTLE</b>
</p><p>[Missiles are launched but are intercepted by darts.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(frustrated)<br />
They didn't even get close.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Pilot, alter heading to intercept. Go to max thrust.</blockquote>
<blockquote>COOPER<br />
Max thrust.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We'll just have to get closer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(quizzically)<br />
The Asgard gave you hyperdrives and shields. How come no offensive weapons?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
They don't like providing other races with anything that could potentially be used against them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought they were allies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Without their beaming technology, you wouldn't be here, Major.<br />
(to Kleinman)<br />
Arm two more Mark VIIIs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You're wasting ordnance, Colonel. Those missiles are being intercepted miles from the hive ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka runs down the stairs into the control room, where he joins McKay who is punching keys on the computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I brought up the shield subroutine. When I give the word, all you have to do is punch in&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(impatiently)<br />
Yes, I know what to do. Go.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay takes the metal box containing the ZPM and joins Weir and two Marines outside the control room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? This is my security escort?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we are spread a little bit thin right now.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(to Marines)<br />
Okay, well, you need to know that if we come under fire, you'll have to put your lives on the line to protect me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, I mean, the ZPM. You need to protect the ZPM at all costs&#8230; and me.<br />
(to Weir)<br />
Am I wrong?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and the Marines leave the gate room.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Dr. Weir?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yes?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
I've lost contact with some of our people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
I can't get a hold of the teams led by Captain Radner, Teyla, or Lieutenant Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, keep trying.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir walks away as Chuck returns to his console, exchanging a sympathetic glance with Zelenka and Beckett.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p><p>[The monitor shows numerous Wraith ships bearing down on the <i>Daedalus</i>.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, now we're oh-for-two. How many of these things have you got?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Only one needs to get through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Is there any way we can deliver a warhead the same way you plucked me out of the Jumper?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
The Asgard have already considered that, Major. There are fail-safes built into the system to prevent their use as a weapons delivery system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've got one of these Asgard on board. Can he override the fail-safe?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Why would he do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, his butt's on the line just as much as ours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Novak, I need you and Hermiod to figure out how to get a site-to-site transport lock on a set of coordinates inside the hive ship.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
(nervously)<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no. Sir, uh, Hermiod isn't going to like that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
Get it done, Doctor. That's an order.</blockquote>
<p>[Hermiod looks quizzically at Novak, who appears anxious.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay and two Marines are stealthily making their way through darkened corridors. They stop when they see two Wraith soldier drones at a control panel ahead.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's where we have to go.</blockquote>
<p>[One of the Marines gives a series of hand signals to the other as the three men take positions.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What's that? I didn't get all that. What do I do? Look, I'm getting good at the roll-y things. Maybe I can&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[The Marines move out, attracting the attention of the Wraith, who come to investigate. They are ambushed and shot.]
</p>
<blockquote>MARINE<br />
(to the other Marine)<br />
Clear.<br />
(to McKay as he tries to go with them)<br />
No. You stay here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<p>[Both Marines are shot by a Wraith soldier drone, who then aims his weapon at McKay. McKay puts down the box containing the ZPM and looks defiantly at the Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So&#8230;this is how it's going to be, huh? Just me?

[Another Wraith enters and aims its weapon at McKay.]

MCKAY
 Okay, that's fine!<br />
(drawing his sidearm)<br />
You want some of this? Huh? Huh?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay attempts to fire at the Wraith but the clip falls out of the gun.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(calling out frantically)<br />
This is McKay! I'm in trouble down here!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay ducks out of the way as automatic weapons fire is heard. Teyla enters, having shot the two Wraith.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Dr. McKay? Are you all right?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Teyla! We thought you were&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
My radio is broken and I was separated from my group. I have been trying to make my way back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, thank God. I mean, you have no idea. I thought I was going to&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
I thought you were very brave.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(surprised)<br />
Really? Oh.</blockquote>
<p>[Teyla looks questioningly at the metal box.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I have a ZPM.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Because we need to get the shields up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Lead the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, sure. Uh, after you.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p><p>[Monitor screen shows a detonation sequence.]
</p>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
I've set the timer for five seconds. Is that enough time for you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERMIOD<br />
Five seconds should be more than ample.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
Okay, look&#8230; I know you don't approve of using technology this way, but you have to understand&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERMIOD<br />
(firmly)<br />
I am ready.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
(into radio)<br />
Colonel, Hermiod is ready and standing by for warhead transport, but I can tell you he is not happy about this.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
I'll take that under advisement.<br />
(to Kleinman)<br />
Are we within transport range?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Yes, Sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Transport warhead when ready.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p>
<blockquote>NOVAK<br />
Ready. Five&#8230;<br />
[beeping]
The weapon is away.</blockquote>
<p>[Hermiod mutters unintelligibly.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;HIVE SHIP IN SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The hive explodes in a massive fireball.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Monitor shows the explosion.]
</p>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
(grinning)<br />
We have a kill. The last hive ship has been neutralized.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Zelenka smile at each other with relief.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Novak, I need you to prep another warhead for transport. We need to take out those cruisers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Sir, wait.</blockquote>
<p>[Through the window behind Sheppard we see Wraith ships disappearing.]
</p>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Colonel, cruisers have broken off and entered hyperspace.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
After seeing what we just did to their remaining hive ships, I don't blame them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There's still a lot of darts out there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All right, let's clean this up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Sir, the Wraith fighters are regrouping.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All rail gun positions stand by for defensive fire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We're not the target.</blockquote>
<blockquote>KLEINMAN<br />
Major Sheppard is right, Sir. The formation is headed toward Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Elizabeth, you've got a problem.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[The monitor shows a large group of red dots moving towards the city.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, we see that, Major.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(over radio)<br />
We're moving to intercept but I don't think we can get there in time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CHUCK<br />
Not a chance. They're coming in too fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
(horrified)<br />
Oh, my God. Their approach is ballistic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And what exactly does that mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Their impact velocities will be in excess of 10,000 kilometers an hour. No part of the city can withstand that.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> BRIDGE</b>
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You better get the damn shield up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How much time do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Forty-five seconds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio, anxiously)<br />
Rodney, we need the shield up in forty seconds or we're dead.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY</b>

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
What, are you kidding me?</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Weir is at the balcony door, which slides open to reveal the cloudy sky from which the darts will descend on the city.]

(into radio)<br />
No.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY</b>
</p>

(into radio)<br />
Because I can't help but think you're just trying to determine the point at which I completely snap.</blockquote>

(into radio)<br />
Rodney!</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS ZPM STATION, DAY</b>
</p><p>[Teyla watches as McKay positions the ZPM in its holder, it illuminates and he runs to a control panel.]

<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(into radio)<br />
That should do it. Fire it up.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CONTROL ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Zelenka shakes his head at Weir. The monitor shows the red dots advancing on the city.]

<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(into radio)<br />
That didn't do it.</blockquote>

(into radio)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
It is not working.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know what she said.</blockquote>

(over radio)<br />
Twenty seconds.</blockquote>

(relieved)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>

Not my point, Major. He was laying face down in the freezing water for over an hour. I don't care how tough he is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So, what are you saying?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We still have no idea how it works, but during the Wraith feeding process, the victim is injected with a special enzyme. It strengthens the human body temporarily and ensures that the heart continues to beat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Why would they want to make you stronger?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
So the victim doesn't die immediately. The feeding process is so traumatic, without the special enzyme we shut down far sooner than they like.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
They make you stronger so they can take more time to kill you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Lovely, isn't it? In most cases, the enzyme is released slowly into the blood stream throughout the feeding process. I can only ascertain that the Wraith died quite suddenly and that Lieutenant Ford's system became flooded with it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And that's why he was able to survive in the water for so long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Exactly. The problem is now the enzyme is breaking down in his system. Eventually there'll be none left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's not good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
No. In fact, I'm quite certain it will kill him. It's possible his body's become dependent on the enzyme to function.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What's the treatment?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
We wean him off it, sneak his body chemistry back to normal incrementally.</blockquote>

If they'd stop firing at it, it'd last almost indefinitely but with this kind of&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are we talking months? Weeks?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Days. At this rate, the ZPM will be depleted within days.</blockquote>
<p>[Concerned looks are exchanged between Weir, Caldwell and Sheppard.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p>[Bright flashes like fireworks fill the sky as the Wraith weapons explode on the shield above the city. McKay and Sheppard stand on a balcony, watching the display.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's almost pretty, isn't it?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Almost. Not quite.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk back inside.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard and McKay join Teyla, Weir, Caldwell, Zelenka and numerous other personnel around the conference table.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We can get the <i>Daedalus</i> back into fighting form within 24 hours, but I think the next engagement's going to have the same result.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Even if we were able to destroy these ships this instant, more would be here in a few days, and even more a few days after that. From where I'm standing, I just don't see how we can win this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, now we know how the Ancients must have felt.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Atlantis is the only way to Earth. As long as they know we're here, they're just going to keep coming.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"As long as they know that we're here."</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What do you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Zelenka just said, "As long as they know that we're here, they'll keep coming."</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yes, he said that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What if they thought we were gone?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Then there'd be no reason for them to stay.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We disappear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Destroy the city, you mean?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No, we just make it look like we did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(clicking his fingers excitedly)<br />
We cloak it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Yes! Yes! The Puddle Jumpers are equipped with cloaking technology, which renders them invisible to the naked eye and to Wraith scans. If we just simply remove one of the cloak generators from the Puddle Jumper&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I wouldn't say "simply", but, yes. By interfacing a Jumper's stealth mode generator with the city shield, we should be able to render the city invisible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
That's all well and good, but I think if the city were to suddenly disappear, they might be able to put one and one together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(wagging his finger and smiling smugly)<br />
Which is why we fake a self-destruct. Have the <i>Daedalus</i> beam a nuke right above the city shield and then detonate it. While their sensors are blinded, we cloak the city. When the smoke clears&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Nothing but ocean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What about hard radiation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I should be able to calculate with reasonable accuracy how long to wait before we switch over to cloak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
What about the displacement issue?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's coplanar emulation. That's the easy part.</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
Okay. What about the hard part?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hard part?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The cloak, for all intents and purposes, will replace the shield, which means that we'll be completely unprotected once the cloak's activated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We'll be completely exposed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So if they're not fooled by the ruse&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Then they destroy the city. Which, I remind you, is exactly what we were going to do anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What about the <i>Daedalus</i>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, if it doesn't work, our shield should be sufficiently recharged to break through their lines and escape. We know we can outrun them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
All right. Let's get as many non-essential personnel onto your ship as we can, just in case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I love this idea, I really do, but the Wraith are aware that we have cloaking technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
They are close. Close enough for me to connect to them. If I can convince them that we intend to destroy Atlantis rather than allow it to be taken, just before the explosion occurs&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How will we know whether or not they believe you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Once they stop the bombardment, we'll know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
He's right. If the Wraith believe that we intend to destroy the city, the last thing they'll want to do is to help us do it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How much time do you need?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Oh, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>ZELENKA<br />
A week.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Couple of hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'll take the second estimate. Go.</blockquote>
<p>[As everyone gets up to leave, McKay looks derisively at Zelenka.]

What, are you union?</blockquote>

(annoyed)<br />
"Couple of hours."</blockquote>

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He escaped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Who?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ford. He was able to disarm one of the Marines and got away with all the Wraith enzyme I had left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Ford, this is Sheppard. Come in. Ford, I need you to come back to the control room, buddy. We're all going home.</blockquote>

(into radio)<br />
You're just afraid of me, Major. You're afraid of what I can do now. I'm not listening to you.</blockquote>

No, you're not.</blockquote>

Oh, crap.</blockquote>

There's only one way to know.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(over radio)<br />
This is <i>Daedalus</i>. Our sensors indicate the Wraith fleet is breaking orbit.</blockquote>

(checking his computer)<br />
I can confirm that. They're headed for hyperspace.<br />
(relieved)<br />
Look, I'm going to keep the cloak up for a while just to be sure, but, uh&#8230;I think they bought it.</blockquote>

</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
The gate address will be in the log. There's still a chance&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doesn't matter where he goes. The second he gets to wherever he's going, he's going to ditch the Jumper, turn around, and dial another address, one we can't trace.</blockquote>

We'll find him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe.</blockquote>

Hey. At least we're still around to try.</blockquote>
