<p><b>PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS</b>
</p><p><i>[Scenes from SGA 2.01 "The Siege Part 3" are shown.]</i>
</p><p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> IN HYPERSPACE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> MESS</b>
</p><p>[Weir is sitting alone in the mess, drinking a cup of something and watching the blue light of hyperspace through the window. Sheppard enters, checking his watch.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey, what are you doing up so late?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(pouring himself a cup of coffee)<br />
Couldn't sleep. Must be the burden of command.</blockquote>
<p>[He takes a seat across from her.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You know, ever since I was promoted to lieutenant colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
All right, John, it's been almost a month. When are you going to stop trying to find a way to bring that up in every single conversation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You've got to understand. There's a lot of people in the air force who never thought I'd make it past captain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, obviously, the people whose opinions matter the most thought otherwise.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir leans back in her chair and smiles jokingly.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What about you? What are you still doing up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Mm, I think I got used to falling asleep to the sound of the ocean.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, McKay says we're already at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy. You'll be fine once we get back to Atlantis. You know, it's funny. I spent the past year wondering if I'd ever see Earth again, and as soon as I got there&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know how you feel. God, it was extremely convenient to be able to step through the gate and be at Stargate Command in an instant, and now this&#8230; It feels extremely inconvenient having to spend 18 days cooped up on this ship to get back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Until we find another ZPM to power the Earth gate, that's just the way it's going to have to be.</blockquote>
<p>[An airman runs into the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>AIRMAN<br />
Dr. Weir, Colonel Sheppard, there's been an accident.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Sheppard follow the airman out.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ROOM</b>
</p><p>[In a room housing a variety of control panels and monitors, Beckett is crouching over a man lying on the floor, feeling for a pulse. There are several crewmen standing behind him, looking on. Sheppard and Weir arrive on the scene.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's Dr. Monroe! What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't know&#8230; but he's dead.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir and Sheppard exchange concerned looks.]
</p><p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and another man are zipping the body of Monroe into a body bag.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, one, two, three.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and two crewmen lift the body bag onto a gurney.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Carry on.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell enters the room]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
How did he die?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not a hundred percent certain. But there are burn marks on his fingertips.</blockquote>
<p>[The crewmen wheel the gurney from the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Obviously there was a short.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard indicates the door control panel on the wall, which shows obvious signs of damage.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Panels are open, circuits are charred.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill anyone. Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'll know more once I've had a chance to examine the body more thoroughly.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett leaves the room. Weir addresses McKay, who is sitting at a console working on the computer.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Do you know what was he was working on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Computer diagnostics, strictly routine. I've got security camera footage.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay activates the monitor in front of them and he, Caldwell, Weir and Sheppard watch the footage. It shows Monroe working at the console until the picture is replaced with interference.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What happened there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. It's a camera malfunction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Right before he was killed? Interesting coincidence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Actually, I think it makes sense. Look, Colonel Caldwell was right. There's not enough juice in those circuits to kill someone, at least not normally.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What are you thinking?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's possible there was some sort of isolated power surge in this section. That would explain the lost camera, the malfunctioning door.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So when the door controls didn't respond, he took out the panel to bypass the circuits and received a fatal jolt?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, like I said, it's possible. Look, I recommend we drop out of hyperspace, run a full diagnostic on the power distribution systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
No, we drop out now, we risk being detected.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That's true. I just think that if we&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We'll be back in Atlantis in less than two days. You can do your diagnostic then.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay is clearly frustrated.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Colonel, are you sure that's wise?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
With all due respect, Doctor, you got back to Earth through the Stargate. This is my third trip on the <i>Daedalus</i> between galaxies.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I understand that, but this ship is relatively new. There might be some problems&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Doctor. A word, please.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell and Weir are walking away from the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I know the chain of command can get a little fuzzy on Atlantis, but that's not going to happen here. You got a problem with my orders&#8230; You take it to me in private. Otherwise, keep your opinions to yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Are you sure that's what this is all about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I've got a job to do, Doctor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But not the one you wanted.</blockquote>
<p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Landry, Weir, Caldwell and several other personnel are seated around the conference table.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
We understand the international committee has approved a significant increase in personnel and resources for the Atlantis mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Now that we have a ZPM, the city can support a much larger contingent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Of course, it's our feeling that a correspondent increase in military presence would also be prudent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I agree. That's why I wanted Major Sheppard to come back with me. In fact, I brought all my senior staff back. I think it's only fair that they participate in the selection process of the new personnel in their respective departments.</blockquote>
<p>[Landry gets up from the table and crosses the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
That's kind of what we wanted to talk to you about. In your report, you singled Major Sheppard out for a lot of credit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
(pouring himself a cup of coffee)<br />
You were also candid enough to document several occasions in which you and the major didn't exactly see eye to eye. In particular, there was an incident involving an alien nanovirus in which Major Sheppard directly disobeyed one of your orders.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
He also saved a lot of lives that day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Well&#8230; the Major's courage and ingenuity are not in question here. His ability to follow the proper chain of command is.</blockquote>
<p>[Landry walks around the table to a position directly opposite Weir and directly behind Caldwell.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm not military, General.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
But you are the leader of the expedition.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
You see, Doctor, from our point of view, Major Sheppard's independent nature poses a bit of a problem. If he can disobey you, he may see fit to do the same to the new commander of the military contingent on Atlantis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(coldly)<br />
Excuse me? And when did this happen?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Of course, the decision hasn't been made yet, but we do have a candidate in mind.</blockquote>
<p>[Weir lets out a breath and looks at Caldwell, who gives a small nod.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(firmly)<br />
Atlantis has a military commander.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
You <i>had</i> a military commander. Colonel Sumner. When he was killed, Major Sheppard correctly assumed the position until a proper replacement could be brought in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Doctor, you can't be suggesting that a mission of this importance be trusted to a major. And one with a questionable record, at that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(to Landry)<br />
Major Sheppard's record before he joined my team doesn't concern me. All I can tell you is that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. And as for his rank&#8230;<br />
(Caldwell smiles incredulously)<br />
Well, if that's not good enough for you, you're just going to have to promote him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LANDRY<br />
Doctor&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I shouldn't have to remind you gentlemen that I continue to have the support of the president and our foreign allies. You don't want to fight me on this one.</blockquote>
<p><b>END FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> IN HYPERSPACE</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell is talking with a crewman as McKay enters through a door.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(to crewman)<br />
All right. Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Colonel Caldwell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What is it, Doctor?</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell starts to walk away. McKay catches up and walks with him.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I realize you've already made it clear that you're not big on the whole dropping-out-of-hyperspace thing, which I understand, given that we would emerge in an uncharted section of the Pegasus galaxy with who knows what waiting for us around the corner&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Doctor?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, I think it's possible&#8230; that Dr. Monroe's death might not have been an accident.</blockquote>
<p>[Caldwell stops walking and turns to face McKay.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What are you talking about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I checked the power distribution logs against the time-code on the security camera. There was an unexplained spike, but it happened a full thirty seconds after the camera went out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
So?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
So that means the malfunction in the door and the camera were not caused by the same problem. Major Sheppard was right. That's too much of a coincidence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You mean Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Right.<br />
(to himself)<br />
That's going to take some getting used to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Is that the only evidence you have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
No, there's something else. It's looks like Dr. Monroe was in the process of enabling certain computer security protocols. They're designed to isolate and shut down corrupted programs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
What programs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. That's just it. He was killed before he could finish.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You're telling me there's a problem with the ship, and someone killed Monroe to cover it up?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I know this sounds crazy, but there is definitely more going on here than random malfunctions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
(into radio)<br />
Bridge, this is Caldwell. Drop us out of hyperspace immediately.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay looks slightly smug.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[The <i>Daedalus</i> drops out of hyperspace.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> ENGINEERING</b>
</p><p>[McKay and numerous personnel are at various consoles.]
</p>
<blockquote>HERMIOD<br />
If I may be so bold, what exactly are we looking for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Any indication that someone's been tampering with the ship's computers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERMIOD<br />
Perhaps you could be more specific.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Not really, no.</blockquote>
<p>[Hermiod sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What was that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>HERMIOD<br />
Nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Look, just check the major systems. Propulsion, navigation, life support. Look for anything out of the ordinary. Lindstrom and I will check power distribution, see if we can figure out what caused the power spike.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard enters the room, staring uncomfortably at Hermiod.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How's it coming, Rodney?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's going to take a while.<br />
(whispers)<br />
Don't stare. He hates it when people stare.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispers)<br />
Am I the only one who thinks it's strange we're working with an alien?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
(whispers)<br />
Intergalactic hyperdrive technology is kind of new to us, so we need his help.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(whispers)<br />
Is he supposed to be naked like that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lindstrom?</blockquote>
<p>[McKay and Sheppard walk away.]
</p><p>[Hermiod mutters unintelligibly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> POWER ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay and Lindstrom enter the room.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Okay, let's speed this up. You take the logs, and I am going to take a look at the&#8230; junction box.</blockquote>
<p>[McKay opens the junction box and starts working in it. Lindstrom is at another console, punching keys.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I've got nothing. You?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINDSTROM<br />
Uh, give me a second&#8230; Wait a minute!</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>LINDSTROM<br />
I think I got something here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, what?</blockquote>
<p>[Rapid beeping, lights flashing, McKay ducks out of the way of a coolant blast from the ceiling.]
</p>
<blockquote>LINDSTROM<br />
It's a coolant leak! Let's get the hell out of here!</blockquote>
<p>[McKay gets to the door but Lindstrom is hit by the coolant blast. He screams and runs the other way, clutching his arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lindstrom! Lindstrom!</blockquote>
<p>[Both men leave the power room by opposite doors, McKay into the corridor and Lindstrom into an airlock, closing the doors after themselves.]

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[McKay is watching Lindstrom through the video communicator.]
</p>
<blockquote>LINDSTROM<br />
Yeah, I'm okay. What happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I don't know. Just sit tight. We're going to need to shut down the leak and vent the room.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> AIRLOCK</b>

<p>[The video screen shows Lindstrom shrugging. He is speaking but there is no sound.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />

<p>[McKay picks up a handset and speaks through it.]

</p><p><b>INT&#8212;<i>DAEDALUS</i> CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[We fade in with the focus on a security camera mounted on the ceiling. Below, Beckett is inspecting McKay as Caldwell, Sheppard and Weir look on. There are a number of other personnel around. McKay removes the oxygen mask he had been holding to his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
I already told you, I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
He's right. It appears he didn't inhale enough toxins to cause any permanent damage, although a few more seconds of exposure and it would have been quite a different story.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett lifts McKay's hand holding the oxygen mask back to his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Thank you, Doctor.</blockquote>
<p>[As Beckett walks away, McKay again removes the oxygen mask from his face.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I assume this time we can definitely rule out random malfunctions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Lindstrom found something. He was trying to tell me what it was when the leak happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
What were you looking for?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
We were trying to trace the source of the power spike that killed Dr. Monroe.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Who else knew what you were doing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
A lot of people knew we were running diagnostics, but no one knew we were in that particular room at that exact moment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Security cameras. If the person who killed Monroe was able to get into the system to erase evidence, there's no reason he couldn't do the same thing to keep tabs on the investigation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Assuming it's a he.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
How many personnel onboard have the technical skills to do something like this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Almost everybody. That's what you get for assembling a team of brilliant scientists.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I can't believe it would be one of our own people. Isn't it possible there's an intruder onboard?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
We used the life-signs detector to do a head count. We didn't get any extra signals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, a hibernating Wraith, they can avoid detection.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We've seen that tactic before. Beam in, lay low, then look for the chance to conduct sabotage.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
That was on Atlantis. It's been at least two months since this ship encountered the Wraith. There's no way one of them could have stowed onboard that long.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
He's right. They did a full decontamination sweep back on Earth. They would've found something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
All right, then.<br />
(to an airman behind him)<br />
As of this moment, I want all civilian personnel confined to their quarters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(incredulous)<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Present company excepted, of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Uh, Colonel, with all due respect, some of those people could be extremely helpful in the investigation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I can't trust any of them for the simple reason that I didn't have any say in their selection. Somebody else was in charge of that process.</blockquote>
<p>[It is clear from the expression on Weir's face that Caldwell is referring to her.]
</p><p><b>FLASHBACK</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;SGC BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Beckett, Weir and several other people are sitting around the conference table, which is piled with personnel files.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Look at this. Four years relief work in the Sudan and Ethiopia. Graduate studies at Johns Hopkins and Harvard. Half a dozen research grants. Oh, and she also enjoys judo, horseback riding, origami, and something called base-jumping.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Parachuting from cliffs and tall buildings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Oh. Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You said you wanted the best.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But all these people are more qualified than I am. How am I supposed to choose between them?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Carson, you're my chief surgeon. No one is more qualified than you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well I've managed to make a short list.<br />

Yes, and changing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WEIR<br />
A Wraith computer virus?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It was probably downloaded during our last little encounter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, if it's been there all this time, why are we just noticing it now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, in all likelihood, it was transmitted in a compressed format. It took a while to unfold, to spread to the point where it could adversely affect our systems. I think it probably happened during your return flight to Earth. Since then, it's been dormant, waiting for some kind of a trigger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Like what?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Possibly the fact that we're once again in proximity to Wraith territory. I think it was ultimately designed to take control of the navigational system. Fly the ship right to them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
If they get their hands on the <i>Daedalus</i>, they'll not only have access to the intergalactic hyperdrive technology, but they'll have all the navigational data that'll lead them straight to Earth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's what they've wanted all along. A new feeding ground.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
This still doesn't explain who killed Dr. Monroe and Dr. Lindstrom.</blockquote>

Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence. It can think for itself, adapt itself to new situations&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Protect itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Exactly. It knew that Lindstrom and Monroe were going to expose it, so it got rid of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Can it take over the whole ship?</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, not entirely. You have to remember that there are hundreds of individual computers onboard. A lot of them are interconnected, so we tend to think of them as one big machine, but that's not really the case. There are dozens of backups and redundancies and some systems, like life support, are deliberately isolated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So they can't kill us all by venting the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
That was the good news. The bad news is some of the more complex systems, like navigation and propulsion, require a certain amount of inter-connectivity to function properly. In all likelihood, the virus has spread so far through those systems, that to isolate it would make the ship impossible to fly. Until we figure out a way to get rid of it, we're stuck here.</blockquote>

Right. Quick question, though, just out of curiosity. How much, uh, like, air do these things carry?</blockquote>

Lots.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, it's fine. Really.<br />
(taking the tablet from Zelenka)<br />
