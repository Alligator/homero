<p><b>TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;SPACE</b>
</p><p>[Travel through wormhole.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard is wheeled in on a gurney, after his right arm has been injured by the feeding hand of Ellia. Beckett walks beside him. McKay walks in behind them.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This really isn't necessary, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, it is. You've got a serious laceration on your arm, and you've lost a good deal of blood.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Yeah, well, enjoy the ride, Colonel. They're making me walk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You have a splinter, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
It's a very nasty, painful splinter.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right, let's have a look at this.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett takes the bandage off Sheppard's arm. He takes a medicated swab from a nurse.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right. Thank you. This might hurt a wee bit.</blockquote>
<p>[In the next bed, a nurse removes the splinter from McKay's hand.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Ow! Ow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(looking at McKay)<br />
I'm sure it will.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett starts cleaning Sheppard's cut.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
This doesn't sting?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
No.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know you have a high threshold for pain, but this&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett has cleaned all the blood off.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is what?</blockquote>
<p>[There's no sign of a wound once the blood is removed.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Gone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The feeding mark. It's completely healed.</blockquote>
<p><b>END TEASER</b>
</p><p><b>OPENING CREDITS</b>
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett draws blood from Sheppard's left arm.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Maybe the wound wasn't that bad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Then where did all the blood come from?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. Maybe it just looked a lot worse than it was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't see evidence of any cut at all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's weird, because it hurt like hell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're sure the skin was broken?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. There was a lot of blood. Maybe it was hers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It was definitely human.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I don't know. Maybe it was a nosebleed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Is that supposed to be a joke, Colonel?</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard stands and puts his vest back on.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Believe me, this isn't funny.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Give me half a day to run your blood work and analyze it with the data we already have. We'll figure it out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
And until then?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You're welcome to look over my shoulder.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, that's tempting, but&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Just go about your day.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CATWALK STRUCTURE</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard runs, followed closely by Ronon. He stops suddenly, as if surprised. Ronon leans over the railing, out of breath.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I thought you said you were a runner.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
That’s funny.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can usually barely keep up. What's with you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
What's with <i>you</i>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Water?</blockquote>
<p>[He gives the water bottle to Ronon.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, sore loser, I don't act like a jerk when you beat me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Yes, you do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, then we'll go around again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
Go ahead.</blockquote>
<p>[Ronon starts to walk away.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Okay, grumpy. I will.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard runs fast in the other direction.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett is working at a laptop. A nurse enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>NURSE<br />
Dr. Beckett? I thought you'd want to see this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Is this from Colonel Sheppard's blood sample?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NURSE<br />
That's right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And you've run it twice?</blockquote>
<blockquote>NURSE<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Okay, let's run it one more time. I want to be certain before I tell him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NURSE<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<p>[They walk out hurriedly.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRAINING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla and Sheppard spar with the wooden rods. Sheppard moves quickly, able to keep up with Teyla. They pause, Teyla looking surprised.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not bad, huh?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Yes, yes. You are doing very well.</blockquote>
<p>[They spare some more, Sheppard approaching aggressively.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You have been practicing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Not really.</blockquote>
<p>[He tosses one of the rods to the floor. They spar again, Sheppard with one arm behind his back. He parries every move from Teyla and backs her against the wall.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are showing a considerable leap in ability, Colonel Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You can call me John when we're off the clock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Very well&#8230;John.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There you go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Should we continue, or do you&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>[He drops his remaining rod, then grabs Teyla's head and kisses her passionately. He pulls away, leaving her in shock.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(confused)<br />
I'm not really sure just what happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That was interesting.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Colonel Sheppard, please report to the infirmary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(concerned)<br />
Are you okay?</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Dr. Beckett will be expecting you.</blockquote>
<p>[He gives her a once over visually.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Beckett and Weir meet with Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The good news is we can now say with some certainty that Ellia didn't drain away any of your life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
We already knew that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I suppose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's the best good news you could come up with?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It looks like you've been infected with the iratus bug retrovirus, the one we’re working on to turn Ellia into a human.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
You mean the one that didn't turn her into a human.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Ellia administered the treatment prematurely. It wasn't ready. It wasn't even supposed to be&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm not blaming you, Doc.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But you're right. Her transformation was into a creature closer to the iratus bug than a to a human, and I know how much you&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hate those bugs?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
But for one, Ellia was a Wraith, and she took a massive dose of the retrovirus. Do we know how the Colonel's system might respond to the drug?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I have no idea. It was never engineered to be given to a human. It was never intended to be given to anyone&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doc, let it go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The problem is I have no idea how your body will react. I can't even begin to guess.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, if how I feel is any indication, I'm fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
It's certainly possible that it's already breaking down in your system. Ellia's transformation was extreme and immediate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
But the wound on your arm healed unnaturally fast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
If there was a wound&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, there had to be, otherwise, I don't see how you got infected in the first place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, she was spitting an awful lot.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett sighs.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
So, what, we just monitor it for now?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Aye. You'll need to check in every six hours.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I can do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And you should probably&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Suspend my off-world activities until we know more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
See you in six hours.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard leaves.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, NIGHT</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir is working on her tablet computer. Caldwell enters.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You're working late.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, not really.</blockquote>
<p>[She holds up her table to show him she was playing solitaire.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Yeah. We keep trying to remove it from the terminals on the <i>Daedalus</i>. Somehow, the crew keeps finding a way of putting it back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Never get between a genius and a computer game&#8230; Aren't you scheduled to fly out?</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I was supposed to, yes, until I heard about Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(nodding)<br />
He's under Beckett's supervision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
If Lieutenant Colonel finds himself unable to perform his duties, that's&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(realizing what he's suggesting)<br />
You have a ship to command, Colonel. I wouldn't want to spread you too thin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Novak and Hermiod are running a full diagnostic on our FTL drive. They're worried about the constant use jumping between galaxies. Which is to say, if I need to, I have some time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay. Let me think about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Thank you. You got chess on there?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
As a matter of fact, I do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Well, I have to warn you that I am a career military strategist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, I'll have to take my chances.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;SHEPPARD'S QUARTERS</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard enters and takes off his jacket. He notices there is a large growth at the point where Ellia wounded him. Purple tendrils radiate outward from a firm center. He puts his earpiece back in.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
Hey, Doc&#8230; this is Sheppard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
(over radio)<br />
Yes, Colonel.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(into radio)<br />
We may have to bump up our first check-in.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;INFIRMARY</b>
</p><p>[Sheppard lies on a bed, his eyes closed, while a technician runs a scanner on him. Beckett and Weir stand by.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The retrovirus isn't breaking down in his system like we hoped it would.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're positive?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes. In fact, it's beginning to alter his DNA. If it's allowed to continue, he'll devolve into a creature similar to what Ellia became.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
How long do we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I'm not sure, exactly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Ballpark. Months? Weeks?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Days. We have days.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Okay, what's the plan?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I've injected him with a viral inhibitor. It should slow down the retrovirus as far as his cognitive abilities are concerned. But I'm afraid that's it so far. We're exploring various treatments that may or may not be effective, so&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, Carson. We don't have any time to explore. Come on. There's got to be something in the Ancient database that can help you find a treatment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I know that, Elizabeth. We're doing our best.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm sorry. I know. Of course you are.</blockquote>
<p>[Across the room, Sheppard is awake.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
You should talk to him. He's hiding it very well, but if I was him, I'd be scared to death.</blockquote>
<p>[Sheppard sits up suddenly and looks over.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
How am I doing?</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett and Weir exchange looks, then she walks over to Sheppard.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Anything that has you speechless has me concerned.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You're going to be fine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Wow. That's dead man talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, it isn't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(showing the growth on his arm)<br />
Have you seen this?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Beckett is going to figure this one out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I think I already have. You know who I'm starting to feel like? Ford.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, what happened to you is completely different.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know, I know. Still, I can feel it. I mean, I can feel it changing me inside, like he did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I don't think that's even possible. Look, you're very worried&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(lightly)<br />
No, no. No, it's uh&#8230;one of the best weeks of my life was when I got my wisdom teeth out. I was on codeine for a full seven days. This is kind of the same. I know I should be in pain, or at the very least freaked out by this, and I'm not&#8230;And that freaks me out more than anything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We're going to beat this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
"We're going to beat this"? "Beckett will figure this out. You're going to be fine"? You really suck at the whole bedside manner thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm know. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
But I appreciate the effort.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Scientists and Beckett have set up in the room with laptops and white boards.]
</p>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #1<br />
No. No. That would only work if the retrovirus was doing what we had originally intended it to do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #2<br />
I disagree. You are not taking into account what's happening to his somatic cells.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #1<br />
The only thing I have to take into account is how off you are, and I don't think I'm the only one who sees that. So, let's move on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, God&#8230; We're looking at this all wrong. The best idea we've had so far is to try to repair his system on the genetic level by administering a massive, cloned embryonic stem cell treatment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #2<br />
I still think it's our best bet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #1<br />
Introducing more human genetic material into his body is only going to give the retrovirus more fuel. I don't know how much simpler I can say that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Yes, yes, I agree. That's why we have to use the iratus bug stem cells.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #1<br />
I'm sorry?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
The iratus bug stem cell, programmed with human RNA, wouldn't get rejected by his system, and would be practically ignored by the current strain of retrovirus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #2<br />
We attack it from the inside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Exactly. It would be like our own magic bullet that could navigate the retrovirus and start to repair his mutated cells.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCIENTIST #2<br />
The only bug pieces we have are from a sample that died a year ago. I have no doubt we could program the cells if we had them, but we do not have the time to artificially produce a gene therapy of that kind of volume.</blockquote>
<p>[Beckett considers this for a moment.]
</p>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Which means, ladies and gentlemen, we need to go on an egg hunt.</blockquote>
<p><b>INT&#8212;CALDWELL'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell works at a laptop. Weir enters, and he starts to stand.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's okay. Sit. Please.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
How's the Colonel?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Not very well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I'm sorry to hear that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Yeah, so am I. I think it would be best if you do assume Colonel Sheppard's duties, until he&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Consider it done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Just until he's back on his feet.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to leave, but he speaks again and she turns around.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You two are pretty close, aren't you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Well, we've been through a lot together, yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
You've got the best team in two galaxies working on a way to get him back to normal. My money's on success. And if you need someone to talk to&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
(businesslike)<br />
If you could assume those duties effective immediately&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
I can do that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Thank you.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves. Caldwell contemplates.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;BRIEFING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[McKay meets with Weir, Beckett, and Lorne.]
</p>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
The Ancient database has quite a lot of information about the iratus bug. We know what planet it's on, we know that it likes cool, damp, dark places to lay its eggs. It shouldn't be that hard to locate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Wait a minute. The last time we ran into <i>one</i> of these things, we almost lost Sheppard. How do you expect to just walk right into one of their nests?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I don't see that we have any other choice. We need the iratus stem cells. The best stem cells come from embryos. With them, we actually have a chance of saving Colonel Sheppard. Without them, he'll die.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
And this is the only option we have?</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
And time's an issue as well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You have no idea what will happen.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
There's only one certainty&#8212;what will happen if we do nothing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
We all understand the risks, Dr. Weir. And I believe that Colonel Sheppard would do the same for any one of us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Permission granted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
I need an hour to get my things together.</blockquote>
<blockquote>LORNE<br />
Okay, gear up. One hour.</blockquote>
<p>[They leave Weir.]
</p><p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, DAY</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;WEIR'S OFFICE</b>
</p><p>[Weir enters. Sheppard arrives, with a marine behind him. He's now dressed in civilian clothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Look. I made a new friend.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
It's only protocol.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
That's your answer for everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You look well.</blockquote>
<p>[She sees that his right hand has transformed to be like Ellia's. He puts it in his pocket. THe right side of his neck is also transforming.]
</p>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Should you be out of bed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I was going a little crazy down there, so they said I could walk around for a bit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
That's good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah. Look, I'm trying to say I want to go on this mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Hey, you said yourself, you are not fit for any off-world activity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
The inhibitor that Beckett's got me on, the one that's keeping me lucid, they keep having to up the dose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know. They told me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(becoming agitated)<br />
I don't know how much more time I have, but the last thing I want to do is sit on my&#8230; mutating hands, while my team puts their lives on the line trying to find me a cure! I should be with them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No. I'm sorry.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
What's the worst that can happen? I die?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You could compromise the mission. They have enough things to worry about&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
So, what? What? Suddenly, I'm a liability?</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Your condition can change rapidly&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I know, and I know I can do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I'm glad you feel that way, but it would be irresponsible of&#8212;</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
This is <i>my</i> life we're talking about.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
I know that.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
I'm going on that mission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
No, John, you're not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Eventually.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well done, Carson for once again elevating medicine to actual science.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Well, thank you, Rodney.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
You'll finally be able to get some sleep. Keep me posted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
All right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>RONON<br />
We might, uh&#8230;</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Stay a while.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MCKAY<br />
Well, if that's all right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BECKETT<br />
Of course.</blockquote>
<p>[Inside the curtained area, Sheppard sleeps.]
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS CORRIDOR</b>
</p><p>[Caldwell and Weir walk together.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
If and when Colonel Sheppard resumes his duties, I hope he'll consider some of the changes that I've made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
When he does, that will be up to him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Of course, and <i>Daedalus</i> will head back to Earth in less than a week. I'll be out of your hair in no time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
We'll try to manage without you till you get back.</blockquote>
<p>[She starts to walk away from him.]
</p>
<blockquote>CALDWELL<br />
Despite what you may think of my intentions, Dr. Weir, I'm not your enemy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>WEIR<br />
Believe me, Colonel&#8230;you don't want to be.</blockquote>
<p><b>EXT&#8212;ATLANTIS, EVENING</b>
</p><p><b>INT&#8212;ATLANTIS TRAINING ROOM</b>
</p><p>[Teyla trains a female crew-member.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Good. Lift, lock, serpentine, lock, and hold. Understood?</blockquote>
<p>[The door opens, and Sheppard steps in. He looks normal again. He's wearing civilian clothing.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Colonel.</blockquote>
<p>[She touches foreheads with the woman, who leaves.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Should you be up and about?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Hey, I've been cooped up in that damn infirmary for a couple of weeks. Give me a break.</blockquote>
<p>[He walks over and picks up two bantos rods.]
</p>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You are looking well. Are you feeling more like yourself?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Well, according to my DNA, I'm one hundred percent John Sheppard again although, I've got to say I'm looking forward to getting rid of this thing one day.</blockquote>
<p>[He shows his right forearm, which still has some blue discoloration.]
</p>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Doc says it'll clear up eventually. So listen&#8230;while I've been lying there the past few weeks, I've been remembering things&#8230; Some things I might have done that you could call out of character.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
You mean when you attacked the security detail?</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
Yeah, that was one of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
(smiling)<br />
Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
There is another thing I should probably apologize for.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Give it no further thought.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SHEPPARD<br />
(relieved)<br />
Good. I won't.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TEYLA<br />
Nice to have you back&#8230;John.</blockquote>
<p>[She leaves. He twirls the rods absently.]
